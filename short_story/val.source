The bell rang furiously and, when Miss Parker went to the tube, a furious voice called out in a piercing North of Ireland accent:  "Send Farrington here!"  Miss Parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was writing at a desk:  "Mr. Alleyne wants you upstairs."  The man muttered "Blast him!" under his breath and pushed back his chair to stand up. When he stood up he was tall and of great bulk. He had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and moustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were dirty. He lifted up the counter and, passing by the clients, went out of the office with a heavy step.  He went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing, where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription Mr. Alleyne. Here he halted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked. The shrill voice cried:  "Come in!"  The man entered Mr. Alleyne's room. Simultaneously Mr. Alleyne, a little man wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a clean-shaven face, shot his head up over a pile of documents. The head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the papers. Mr. Alleyne did not lose a moment:  "Farrington? What is the meaning of this? Why have I always to complain of you? May I ask you why you haven't made a copy of that contract between Bodley and Kirwan? I told you it must be ready by four o'clock."  "But Mr. Shelley said, sir ———"  "Mr. Shelley said, sir. . . . Kindly attend to what I say and not to what Mr. Shelley says, sir. You have always some excuse or another for shirking work. Let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before this evening I'll lay the matter before Mr. Crosbie. . . . Do you hear me now?"  "Yes, sir."  "Do you hear me now? . . . Ay and another little matter! I might as well be talking to the wall as talking to you. Understand once for all that you get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half. How many courses do you want, I'd like to know. . . . Do you mind me now?"  "Yes, sir."  Mr. Alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of papers. The man stared fixedly at the polished skull which directed the affairs of Crosbie & Alleyne, gauging its fragility. A spasm of rage gripped his throat for a few moments and then passed, leaving after it a sharp sensation of thirst. The man recognised the sensation and felt that he must have a good night's drinking. The middle of the month was passed and, if he could get the copy done in time, Mr. Alleyne might give him an order on the cashier. He stood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of papers. Suddenly Mr. Alleyne began to upset all the papers, searching for something. Then, as if he had been unaware of the man's presence till that moment, he shot up his head again, saying:  "Eh? Are you going to stand there all day? Upon my word, Farrington, you take things easy!"  "I was waiting to see . . ."  "Very good, you needn't wait to see. Go downstairs and do your work."  The man walked heavily towards the door and, as he went out of the room, he heard Mr. Alleyne cry after him that if the contract was not copied by evening Mr. Crosbie would hear of the matter.  He returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which remained to be copied. He took up his pen and dipped it in the ink but he continued to stare stupidly at the last words he had written: In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be . . . The evening was falling and in a few minutes they would be lighting the gas: then he could write. He felt that he must slake the thirst in his throat. He stood up from his desk and, lifting the counter as before, passed out of the office. As he was passing out the chief clerk looked at him inquiringly.  "It's all right, Mr. Shelley," said the man, pointing with his finger to indicate the objective of his journey.  The chief clerk glanced at the hat-rack, but, seeing the row complete, offered no remark. As soon as he was on the landing the man pulled a shepherd's plaid cap out of his pocket, put it on his head and ran quickly down the rickety stairs. From the street door he walked on furtively on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at once dived into a doorway. He was now safe in the dark snug of O'Neill's shop, and, filling up the little window that looked into the bar with his inflamed face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he called out:  "Here, Pat, give us a g.p., like a good fellow."  The curate brought him a glass of plain porter. The man drank it at a gulp and asked for a caraway seed. He put his penny on the counter and, leaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom, retreated out of the snug as furtively as he had entered it.  Darkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the dusk of February and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit. The man went up by the houses until he reached the door of the office, wondering whether he could finish his copy in time. On the stairs a moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his nose: evidently Miss Delacour had come while he was out in O'Neill's. He crammed his cap back again into his pocket and re-entered the office, assuming an air of absent-mindedness. "Mr. Alleyne has been calling for you," said the chief clerk severely. "Where were you?"  The man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him from answering. As the clients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh.  "I know that game," he said. "Five times in one day is a little bit. . . . Well, you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the Delacour case for Mr. Alleyne."  This address in the presence of the public, his run upstairs and the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man and, as he sat down at his desk to get what was required, he realised how hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of the contract before half past five. The dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars, drinking with his friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses. He got out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the office. He hoped Mr. Alleyne would not discover that the last two letters were missing.  The moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr. Alleyne's room. Miss Delacour was a middle-aged woman of Jewish appearance. Mr. Alleyne was said to be sweet on her or on her money. She came to the office often and stayed a long time when she came. She was sitting beside his desk now in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and nodding the great black feather in her hat. Mr. Alleyne had swivelled his chair round to face her and thrown his right foot jauntily upon his left knee. The man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully but neither Mr. Alleyne nor Miss Delacour took any notice of his bow. Mr. Alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him as if to say: "That's all right: you can go."  The man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk. He stared intently at the incomplete phrase: In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be . . . and thought how strange it was that the last three words began with the same letter. The chief clerk began to hurry Miss Parker, saying she would never have the letters typed in time for post. The man listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes and then set to work to finish his copy. But his head was not clear and his mind wandered away to the glare and rattle of the public-house. It was a night for hot punches. He struggled on with his copy, but when the clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write. Blast it! He couldn't finish it in time. He longed to execrate aloud, to bring his fist down on something violently. He was so enraged that he wrote Bernard Bernard instead of Bernard Bodley and had to begin again on a clean sheet.  He felt strong enough to clear out the whole office single-handed. His body ached to do something, to rush out and revel in violence. All the indignities of his life enraged him. . . . Could he ask the cashier privately for an advance? No, the cashier was no good, no damn good: he wouldn't give an advance. . . . He knew where he would meet the boys: Leonard and O'Halloran and Nosey Flynn. The barometer of his emotional nature was set for a spell of riot.  His imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called twice before he answered. Mr. Alleyne and Miss Delacour were standing outside the counter and all the clerks had turned round in anticipation of something. The man got up from his desk. Mr. Alleyne began a tirade of abuse, saying that two letters were missing. The man answered that he knew nothing about them, that he had made a faithful copy. The tirade continued: it was so bitter and violent that the man could hardly restrain his fist from descending upon the head of the manikin before him:  "I know nothing about any other two letters," he said stupidly.  "You—know—nothing. Of course you know nothing," said Mr. Alleyne. "Tell me," he added, glancing first for approval to the lady beside him, "do you take me for a fool? Do you think me an utter fool?"  The man glanced from the lady's face to the little egg-shaped head and back again; and, almost before he was aware of it, his tongue had found a felicitous moment:  "I don't think, sir," he said, "that that's a fair question to put to me."  There was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks. Everyone was astounded (the author of the witticism no less than his neighbours) and Miss Delacour, who was a stout amiable person, began to smile broadly. Mr. Alleyne flushed to the hue of a wild rose and his mouth twitched with a dwarf's passion. He shook his fist in the man's face till it seemed to vibrate like the knob of some electric machine:  "You impertinent ruffian! You impertinent ruffian! I'll make short work of you! Wait till you see! You'll apologise to me for your impertinence or you'll quit the office instanter! You'll quit this, I'm telling you, or you'll apologise to me!"  *⁠*⁠*⁠*⁠*⁠* He stood in a doorway opposite the office watching to see if the cashier would come out alone. All the clerks passed out and finally the cashier came out with the chief clerk. It was no use trying to say a word to him when he was with the chief clerk. The man felt that his position was bad enough. He had been obliged to offer an abject apology to Mr. Alleyne for his impertinence but he knew what a hornet's nest the office would be for him. He could remember the way in which Mr. Alleyne had hounded little Peake out of the office in order to make room for his own nephew. He felt savage and thirsty and revengeful, annoyed with himself and with everyone else. Mr. Alleyne would never give him an hour's rest; his life would be a hell to him. He had made a proper fool of himself this time. Could he not keep his tongue in his cheek? But they had never pulled together from the first, he and Mr. Alleyne, ever since the day Mr. Alleyne had overheard him mimicking his North of Ireland accent to amuse Higgins and Miss Parker: that had been the beginning of it. He might have tried Higgins for the money, but sure Higgins never had anything for himself. A man with two establishments to keep up, of course he couldn't. . . .  He felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the public-house. The fog had begun to chill him and he wondered could he touch Pat in O'Neill's. He could not touch him for more than a bob—and a bob was no use. Yet he must get money somewhere or other: he had spent his last penny for the g.p. and soon it would be too late for getting money anywhere. Suddenly, as he was fingering his watch-chain, he thought of Terry Kelly's pawn-office in Fleet Street. That was the dart! Why didn't he think of it sooner?  He went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly, muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he was going to have a good night of it. The clerk in Terry Kelly's said A crown! but the consignor held out for six shillings; and in the end the six shillings was allowed him literally. He came out of the pawn-office joyfully, making a little cylinder of the coins between his thumb and fingers. In Westmoreland Street the footpaths were crowded with young men and women returning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out the names of the evening editions. The man passed through the crowd, looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring masterfully at the office-girls. His head was full of the noises of tram-gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the curling fumes of punch. As he walked on he preconsidered the terms in which he would narrate the incident to the boys:  "So, I just looked at him—coolly, you know, and looked at her. Then I looked back at him again—taking my time, you know. 'I don't think that that's a fair question to put to me,' says I."  Nosey Flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of Davy Byrne's and, when he heard the story, he stood Farrington a half-one, saying it was as smart a thing as ever he heard. Farrington stood a drink in his turn. After a while O'Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. O'Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in Callan's of Fownes's Street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington's retort. At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another.  Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which Mr. Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington's face. Then he imitated Farrington, saying, "And here was my nabs, as cool as you please," while Farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip.  When that round was over there was a pause. O'Halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back towards the city. Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when they reached the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House. The bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses. The three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter. They began to exchange stories. Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named Weathers who was performing at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout artiste. Farrington stood a drink all round. Weathers said he would take a small Irish and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite notions of what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too; but the boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became theatrical. O'Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another round, Weathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish. He promised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls. O'Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that Farrington wouldn't go because he was a married man; and Farrington's heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being chaffed. Weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan's in Poolbeg Street.  When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan's. They went into the parlour at the back and O'Halloran ordered small hot specials all round. They were all beginning to feel mellow. Farrington was just standing another round when Weathers came back. Much to Farrington's relief he drank a glass of bitter this time. Funds were getting low but they had enough to keep them going. Presently two young women with big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close by. Weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the Tivoli. Farrington's eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young women. There was something striking in her appearance. An immense scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow gloves, reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace; and when, after a little time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark brown eyes. The oblique staring expression in them fascinated him. She glanced at him once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room, she brushed against his chair and said "O, pardon!" in a London accent. He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at him, but he was disappointed. He cursed his want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood, particularly all the whiskies and Apollinaris which he had stood to Weathers. If there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge. He was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of his friends.  When Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking about feats of strength. Weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on Farrington to uphold the national honour, Farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company. The two arms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength. The table was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it, clasping hands. When Paddy Leonard said "Go!" each was to try to bring down the other's hand on to the table. Farrington looked very serious and determined.  The trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his opponent's hand slowly down on to the table. Farrington's dark wine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling.  "You're not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play fair," he said.  "Who's not playing fair?" said the other.  "Come on again. The two best out of three."  The trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington's forehead, and the pallor of Weathers' complexion changed to peony. Their hands and arms trembled under the stress. After a long struggle Weathers again brought his opponent's hand slowly on to the table. There was a murmur of applause from the spectators. The curate, who was standing beside the table, nodded his red head towards the victor and said with stupid familiarity:  "Ah! that's the knack!"  "What the hell do you know about it?" said Farrington fiercely, turning on the man. "What do you put in your gab for?"  "Sh, sh!" said O'Halloran, observing the violent expression of Farrington's face. "Pony up, boys. We'll have just one little smahan more and then we'll be off."   A very sullen-faced man stood at the corner of O'Connell Bridge waiting for the little Sandymount tram to take him home. He was full of smouldering anger and revengefulness. He felt humiliated and discontented; he did not even feel drunk; and he had only twopence in his pocket. He cursed everything. He had done for himself in the office, pawned his watch, spent all his money; and he had not even got drunk. He began to feel thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot reeking public-house. He had lost his reputation as a strong man, having been defeated twice by a mere boy. His heart swelled with fury and, when he thought of the woman in the big hat who had brushed against him and said Pardon! his fury nearly choked him.  His tram let him down at Shelbourne Road and he steered his great body along in the shadow of the wall of the barracks. He loathed returning to his home. When he went in by the side-door he found the kitchen empty and the kitchen fire nearly out. He bawled upstairs:  "Ada! Ada!"  His wife was a little sharp-faced woman who bullied her husband when he was sober and was bullied by him when he was drunk. They had five children. A little boy came running down the stairs.  "Who is that?" said the man, peering through the darkness.  "Me, pa."  "Who are you? Charlie?"  "No, pa. Tom."  "Where's your mother?"  "She's out at the chapel."  "That's right. . . . Did she think of leaving any dinner for me?"  "Yes, pa. I ———"  "Light the lamp. What do you mean by having the place in darkness? Are the other children in bed?"  The man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the little boy lit the lamp. He began to mimic his son's flat accent, saying half to himself: "At the chapel. At the chapel, if you please!" When the lamp was lit he banged his fist on the table and shouted:  "What's for my dinner?"  "I'm going . . . to cook it, pa," said the little boy.  The man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire.  "On that fire! You let the fire out! By God, I'll teach you to do that again!"  He took a step to the door and seized the walking-stick which was standing behind it.  "I'll teach you to let the fire out!" he said, rolling up his sleeve in order to give his arm free play.  The little boy cried "O, pa!" and ran whimpering round the table, but the man followed him and caught him by the coat. The little boy looked about him wildly but, seeing no way of escape, fell upon his knees. "Now, you'll let the fire out the next time!" said the man, striking at him vigorously with the stick. "Take that, you little whelp!"  The boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh. He clasped his hands together in the air and his voice shook with fright.  "O, pa!" he cried. "Don't beat me, pa! And I'll . . . I'll say a Hail Mary for you. . . . I'll say a Hail Mary for you, pa, if you don't beat me. . . . I'll say a Hail Mary. . . ."
Irish writer Frank O’Connor explains, far better than Freud might have done ...  Father was in the army all through the war - the first war, I mean - so, up to the age of five, I never saw much of him, and what I saw did not worry me. Sometimes I woke and there was a big figure in khaki peering down at me in the candlelight. Sometimes in the early morning I heard the slamming of the front door and the clatter of nailed boots down the cobbles of the lane. These were Father’s entrances and exits. Like Santa Claus he came and went mysteriously.  In fact, I rather liked his visits, though it was an uncomfortable squeeze between Mother and him when I got into the big bed in the early morning. He smoked, which gave him a pleasant musty smell, and shaved, an operation of astounding interest. Each time he left a trail of souvenirs - model tanks and Gurkha knives with handles made of bullet cases, and German helmets and cap badges and button sticks, and all sorts of military equipment - carefully stowed away in a long box on top of the wardrobe, in case they ever came in handy. There was a bit of the magpie about Father; he expected everything to come in handy. When his back was turned, Mother let me get a chair and rummage through his treasures. She didn’t seem to think so highly of them as he did.  The war was the most peaceful period of my life. The window of my attic faced southeast. My mother had curtained it, but that had small effect. I always woke with the first light and, with all the responsibilities of the previous day melted, feeling myself rather like the sun, ready to illumine and rejoice. Life never seemed so simple and clear and full of possibilities as then. I put my feet out from under the clothes - I called them Mrs. Left and Mrs. Right “and invented dramatic situations for them in which they discussed the problems of the day. At least Mrs. Right did; she was very demonstrative, but I hadn’t the same control of Mrs. Left, so she mostly contented herself with nodding agreement.  They discussed what Mother and I should do during the day, what Santa Claus should give a fellow for Christmas, and what steps should be taken to brighten the home. There was that little matter of the baby, for instance. Mother and I could never agree about that. Ours was the only house in the terrace without a new baby, and Mother said we couldn’t afford one till Father came back from the war because they cost seventeen and six.  That showed how simple she was. The Geneys up the road had a baby, and everyone knew they couldn’t afford seventeen and six. It was probably a cheap baby, and Mother wanted something really good, but I felt she was too exclusive. The Geneys' baby would have done us fine.  Having settled my plans for the day, I got up, put a chair under the attic window, and lifted the frame high enough to stick out my head. The window overlooked the front gardens of the terrace behind ours, and beyond these it looked over a deep valley to the tall, red brick houses terraced up the opposite hillside, which were all still in shadow, while those at our side of the valley were all lit up, though with long strange shadows that made them seem unfamiliar; rigid and painted.  After that I went into Mother’s room and climbed into the big bed. She woke and I began to tell her of my schemes. By this time, though I never seemed to have noticed it, I was petrified in my nightshirt, and I thawed as I talked until, the last frost melted, I fell asleep beside her and woke again only when I heard her below in the kitchen, making the breakfast.  After breakfast we went into town; heard Mass at St. Augustine’s and said a prayer for Father, and did the shopping. If the afternoon was fine we either went for a walk in the country or a visit to Mother’s great friend in the convent, Mother Saint Dominic. Mother had them all praying for Father, and every night, going to bed, I asked God to send him back safe from the war to us. Little, indeed, did I know what I was praying for!  One morning, I got into the big bed, and there, sure enough, was Father in his usual Santa Claus manner, but later, instead of uniform, he put on his best blue suit, and Mother was as pleased as anything. I saw nothing to be pleased about, because, out of uniform, Father was altogether less interesting, but she only beamed, and explained that our prayers had been answered, and off we went to Mass to thank God for having brought Father safely home.  The irony of it! That very day when he came in to dinner he took off his boots and put on his slippers, donned the dirty old cap he wore about the house to save him from colds, crossed his legs, and began to talk gravely to Mother, who looked anxious. Naturally, I disliked her looking anxious, because it destroyed her good looks, so I interrupted him.  "Just a moment, Larry!" she said gently. This was only what she said when we had boring visitors, so I attached no importance to it and went on talking.  "Do be quiet, Larry!" she said impatiently. "Don’t you hear me talking to Daddy?"  This was the first time I had heard those ominous words, "talking to Daddy," and I couldn’t help feeling that if this was how God answered prayers, he couldn’t listen to them very attentively.  "Why are you talking to Daddy?" I asked with as great a show of indifference as I could muster.  "Because Daddy and I have business to discuss. Now, don’t interrupt again!"  In the afternoon, at Mother’s request, Father took me for a walk. This time we went into town instead of out in the country, and I thought at first, in my usual optimistic way, that it might be an improvement. It was nothing of the sort. Father and I had quite different notions of a walk in town. He had no proper interest in trams, ships, and horses, and the only thing that seemed to divert him was talking to fellows as old as himself. When I wanted to stop he simply went on, dragging me behind him by the hand; when he wanted to stop I had no alternative but to do the same. I noticed that it seemed to be a sign that he wanted to stop for a long time whenever he leaned against a wall. The second time I saw him do it I got wild. He seemed to be settling himself forever. I pulled him by the coat and trousers, but, unlike Mother who, if you were too persistent, got into a wax and said: "Larry, if you don’t behave yourself, I'll give you a good slap," Father had an extraordinary capacity for amiable inattention. I sized him up and wondered would I cry, but he seemed to be too remote to be annoyed even by that. Really, it was like going for a walk with a mountain! He either ignored the wrenching and pummeling entirely, or else glanced down with a grin of amusement from his peak. I had never met anyone so absorbed in himself as he seemed.  At teatime, "talking to Daddy" began again, complicated this time by the fact that he had an evening paper, and every few minutes he put it down and told Mother something new out of it. I felt this was foul play. Man for man, I was prepared to compete with him any time for Mother’s attention, but when he had it all made up for him by other people it left me no chance. Several times I tried to change the subject without success.  "You must be quiet while Daddy is reading, Larry," Mother said impatiently.  It was clear that she either genuinely liked talking to Father better than talking to me, or else that he had some terrible hold on her which made her afraid to admit the truth.  "Mummy," I said that night when she was tucking me up, "do you think if I prayed hard God would send Daddy back to the war?"  She seemed to think about that for a moment.  "No, dear," she said with a smile. "I don’t think He would."  "Why wouldn’t He, Mummy?"  "Because there isn’t a war any longer, dear."  "But, Mummy, couldn’t God make another war, if He liked?"  "He wouldn’t like to, dear. It’s not God who makes wars, but bad people.  "Oh!" I said. I was disappointed about that. I began to think that God wasn’t quite what He was cracked up to be.  Next morning I woke at my usual hour, feeling like a bottle of champagne. I put out my feet and invented a long conversation in which Mrs. Right talked of the trouble she had with her own father till she put him in the Home. I didn’t quite know what the Home was but it sounded the right place for Father. Then I got my chair and stuck my head out of the attic window. Dawn was just breaking, with a guilty air that made me feel I had caught it in the act. My head bursting with stories and schemes, I stumbled in next door, and in the half-darkness scrambled into the big bed. There was no room at Mother’s side so I had to get between her and Father. For the time being I had forgotten about him, and for several minutes I sat bolt upright, racking my brains to know what I could do with him. He was taking up more than his fair share of the bed, and I couldn’t get comfortable, so I gave him several kicks that made him grunt and stretch. He made room all right, though. Mother waked and felt for me. I settled back comfortably in the warmth of the bed with my thumb in my mouth. "Mummy!" I hummed, loudly and contentedly.  "Sssh! dear," she whispered. "Don’t wake Daddy!"  This was a new development, which threatened to be even more serious than "talking to Daddy." Life without my early-morning conferences was unthinkable.  "Why?" I asked severely.  "Because poor Daddy is tired." This seemed to me a quite inadequate reason, and I was sickened by the sentimentality of her "poor Daddy." I never liked that sort of gush; it always struck me as insincere.  "Oh!" I said lightly. Then in my most winning tone: "Do you know where I want to go with you today, Mummy?"  "No, dear," she sighed.  "I want to go down the Glen and fish for thornybacks with my new net, and then I want to go out to the Fox and Hounds, and “"  "Don“t-wake-Daddy!" she hissed angrily, clapping her hand across my mouth.  But it was too late. He was awake, or nearly so. He grunted and reached for the matches. Then he stared incredulously at his watch.  "Like a cup of tea, dear?" asked Mother in a meek, hushed voice I had never heard her use before. It sounded almost as though she were afraid.  "Tea?" he exclaimed indignantly. "Do you know what the time is?"  "And after that I want to go up the Rathcooney Road," I said loudly, afraid I’d forget something in all those interruptions.  "Go to sleep at once, Larry!" she said sharply.  I began to snivel. I couldn’t concentrate, the way that pair went on, and smothering my early-morning schemes was like burying a family from the cradle. Father said nothing, but lit his pipe and sucked it, looking out into the shadows without minding Mother or me. I knew he was mad. Every time I made a remark Mother hushed me irritably. I was mortified. I felt it wasn’t fair; there was even something sinister in it. Every time I had pointed out to her the waste of making two beds when we could both sleep in one, she had told me it was healthier like that, and now here was this man, this stranger, sleeping with her without the least regard for her health! He got up early and made tea, but though he brought Mother a cup he brought none for me.  "Mummy," I shouted, "I want a cup of tea, too."  "Yes, dear," she said patiently. "You can drink from Mummy’s saucer."  That settled it. Either Father or I would have to leave the house. I didn’t want to drink from Mother’s saucer; I wanted to be treated as an equal in my own home, so, just to spite her, I drank it all and left none for her. She took that quietly, too. But that night when she was putting me to bed she said gently:  "Larry, I want you to promise me something."  "What is it?" I asked.  "Not to come in and disturb poor Daddy in the morning. Promise?"  "Poor Daddy" again! I was becoming suspicious of everything involving that quite impossible man.  "Why?" I asked.  "Because poor Daddy is worried and tired and he doesn’t sleep well."  "Why doesn’t he, Mummy?"  "Well, you know, don’t you, that while he was at the war Mummy got the pennies from the post office?"  "From Miss MacCarthy?"  "That’s right. But now, you see, Miss MacCarthy hasn’t any more pennies, so Daddy must go out and find us some. You know what would happen if he couldn't?"  "No," I said, "tell us."  "Well, I think we might have to go out and beg for them like the poor old woman on Fridays. We wouldn’t like that, would we?"  "No," I agreed. "We wouldn't."  "So you'll promise not to come in and wake him?"  "Promise."  Mind you, I meant that. I knew pennies were a serious matter, and I was all against having to go out and beg like the old woman on Fridays. Mother laid out all my toys in a complete ring round the bed so that, whatever way I got out, I was bound to fall over one of them. When I woke I remembered my promise all right. I got up and sat on the floor and played - for hours, it seemed to me. Then I got my chair and looked out the attic window for more hours. I wished it was time for Father to wake; I wished someone would make me a cup of tea. I didn’t feel in the least like the sun; instead, I was bored and so very, very cold! I simply longed for the warmth and depth of the big feather bed. At last I could stand it no longer. I went into the next room. As there was still no room at Mother’s side I climbed over her and she woke with a start. "Larry," she whispered, gripping my arm very tightly, "what did you promise?"  "But I did, Mummy," I wailed, caught in the very act. "I was quiet for ever so long."  "Oh, dear, and you’re perished!" she said sadly, feeling me all over. "Now, if I let you stay will you promise not to talk?"  "But I want to talk, Mummy," I wailed.  "That has nothing to do with it," she said with a firmness that was new to me. "Daddy wants to sleep. Now, do you understand that?"  I understood it only too well. I wanted to talk, he wanted to sleep - whose house was it, anyway?  "Mummy," I said with equal firmness, "I think it would be healthier for Daddy to sleep in his own bed."  That seemed to stagger her, because she said nothing for a while.  "Now, once for all," she went on, "you’re to be perfectly quiet or go back to your own bed. Which is it to be?"  The injustice of it got me down. I had convicted her out of her own mouth of inconsistency and unreasonableness, and she hadn’t even attempted to reply. Full of spite, I gave Father a kick, which she didn’t notice but which made him grunt and open his eyes in alarm.  "What time is it?" he asked in a panic-stricken voice, not looking at Mother but at the door, as if he saw someone there.  "It’s early yet," she replied soothingly. "It’s only the child. Go to sleep again.... Now, Larry," she added, getting out of bed, "you've wakened Daddy and you must go back."  This time, for all her quiet air, I knew she meant it, and knew that my principal rights and privileges were as good as lost unless I asserted them at once. As she lifted me, I gave a screech, enough to wake the dead, not to mind Father.  He groaned. "That damn child! Doesn’t he ever sleep?"  "It’s only a habit, dear," she said quietly, though I could see she was vexed.  "Well, it’s time he got out of it," shouted Father, beginning to heave in the bed. He suddenly gathered all the bedclothes about him, turned to the wall, and then looked back over his shoulder with nothing showing only two small, spiteful, dark eyes. The man looked very wicked. To open the bedroom door, Mother had to let me down, and I broke free and dashed for the farthest corner, screeching.  Father sat bolt upright in bed. "Shut up, you little puppy," he said in a choking voice.  I was so astonished that I stopped screeching. Never, never had anyone spoken to me in that tone before. I looked at him incredulously and saw his face convulsed with rage. It was only then that I fully realized how God had codded me, listening to my prayers for the safe return of this monster.  "Shut up, you!" I bawled, beside myself.  "What’s that you said?" shouted Father, making a wild leap out of the bed.  "Mick, Mick!" cried Mother. "Don’t you see the child isn’t used to you?"  "I see he’s better fed than taught," snarled Father, waving his arms wildly. "He wants his bottom smacked."  All his previous shouting was as nothing to these obscene words referring to my person. They really made my blood boil.  "Smack your own!" I screamed hysterically. "Smack your own! Shut up! Shut up!"  At this he lost his patience and let fly at me. He did it with the lack of conviction you’d expect of a man under Mother’s horrified eyes, and it ended up as a mere tap, but the sheer indignity of being struck at all by a stranger, a total stranger who had cajoled his way back from the war into our big bed as a result of my innocent intercession, made me completely dotty. I shrieked and shrieked, and danced in my bare feet, and Father, looking awkward and hairy in nothing but a short gray army shirt, glared down at me like a mountain out for murder. I think it must have been then that I realized he was jealous too. And there stood Mother in her nightdress, looking as if her heart was broken between us. I hoped she felt as she looked. It seemed to me that she deserved it all.  From that morning out my life was a hell. Father and I were enemies, open and avowed. We conducted a series of skirmishes against one another, he trying to steal my time with Mother and I his. When she was sitting on my bed, telling me a story, he took to looking for some pair of old boots which he alleged he had left behind him at the beginning of the war. While he talked to Mother I played loudly with my toys to show my total lack of concern.  He created a terrible scene one evening when he came in from work and found me at his box, playing with his regimental badges, Gurkha knives and button sticks. Mother got up and took the box from me.  "You mustn’t play with Daddy’s toys unless he lets you, Larry," she said severely. "Daddy doesn’t play with yours."  For some reason Father looked at her as if she had struck him and then turned away with a scowl. "Those are not toys," he growled, taking down the box again to see had I lifted anything. "Some of those curios are very rare and valuable."  But as time went on I saw more and more how he managed to alienate Mother and me. What made it worse was that I couldn’t grasp his method or see what attraction he had for Mother. In every possible way he was less winning than I. He had a common accent and made noises at his tea. I thought for a while that it might be the newspapers she was interested in, so I made up bits of news of my own to read to her. Then I thought it might be the smoking, which I personally thought attractive, and took his pipes and went round the house dribbling into them till he caught me. I even made noises at my tea, but Mother only told me I was disgusting. It all seemed to hinge round that unhealthy habit of sleeping together, so I made a point of dropping into their bedroom and nosing round, talking to myself, so that they wouldn’t know I was watching them, but they were never up to anything that I could see. In the end it beat me. It seemed to depend on being grown-up and giving people rings, and I realized I’d have to wait. But at the same time I wanted him to see that I was only waiting, not giving up the fight.  One evening when he was being particularly obnoxious, chattering away well above my head, I let him have it.  "Mummy," I said, "do you know what I’m going to do when I grow up?"  "No, dear," she replied. "What?"  "I’m going to marry you," I said quietly.  Father gave a great guffaw out of him, but he didn’t take me in. I knew it must only be pretence.  And Mother, in spite of everything, was pleased. I felt she was probably relieved to know that one day Father’s hold on her would be broken.  "Won’t that be nice?" she said with a smile.  "It'll be very nice," I said confidently. "Because we’re going to have lots and lots of babies."  "That’s right, dear," she said placidly. "I think we’ll have one soon, and then you'll have plenty of company."  I was no end pleased about that because it showed that in spite of the way she gave in to Father she still considered my wishes. Besides, it would put the Geneys in their place. It didn’t turn out like that, though. To begin with, she was very preoccupied - I supposed about where she would get the seventeen and six - and though Father took to staying out late in the evenings it did me no particular good. She stopped taking me for walks, became as touchy as blazes, and smacked me for nothing at all. Sometimes I wished I’d never mentioned the confounded baby - I seemed to have a genius for bringing calamity on myself.  And calamity it was! Sonny arrived in the most appalling hulla-baloo - even that much he couldn’t do without a fuss - and from the first moment I disliked him. He was a difficult child - so far as I was concerned he was always difficult - and demanded far too much attention. Mother was simply silly about him, and couldn’t see when he was only showing off. As company he was worse than useless. He slept all day, and I had to go round the house on tiptoe to avoid waking him. It wasn’t any longer a question of not waking Father. The slogan now was "Don't-wake-Sonny!" I couldn’t understand why the child wouldn’t sleep at the proper time, so whenever Mother’s back was turned I woke him. Sometimes to keep him awake I pinched him as well. Mother caught me at it one day and gave me a most unmerciful flaking.  One evening, when Father was coming in from work, I was playing trains in the front garden. I let on not to notice him; instead, I pretended to be talking to myself, and said in a loud voice: "If another bloody baby comes into this house, I’m going out."  Father stopped dead and looked at me over his shoulder. "What’s that you said?" he asked sternly.  ""I was only talking to myself," I replied, trying to conceal my panic. "It’s private."  He turned and went in without a word.  Mind you, I intended it as a solemn warning, but its effect was quite different. Father started being quite nice to me. I could understand that, of course. Mother was quite sickening about Sonny. Even at mealtimes she’d get up and gawk at him in the cradle with an idiotic smile, and tell Father to do the same. He was always polite about it, but he looked so puzzled you could see he didn’t know what she was talking about. He complained of the way Sonny cried at night, but she only got cross and said that Sonny never cried except when there was something up with him - which was a flaming lie, because Sonny never had anything up with him, and only cried for attention. It was really painful to see how simpleminded she was.  Father wasn’t attractive, but he had a fine intelligence. He saw through Sonny, and now he knew that I saw through him as well. One night I woke with a start. There was someone beside me in the bed. For one wild moment I felt sure it must be Mother, having come to her senses and left Father for good, but then I heard Sonny in convulsions in the next room, and Mother saying: "There! There! There!" and I knew it wasn’t she. It was Father. He was lying beside me, wide-awake, breathing hard and apparently as mad as hell. After a while it came to me what he was mad about. It was his turn now. After turning me out of the big bed, he had been turned out himself. Mother had no consideration now for anyone but that poisonous pup, Sonny.  I couldn’t help feeling sorry for Father. I had been through it all myself, and even at that age I was magnanimous. I began to stroke him down and say: "There! There!"  He wasn’t exactly responsive. "Aren’t you asleep either?" he snarled.  "Ah, come on and put your arm around us, can’t you?" I said, and he did, in a sort of way. Gingerly, I suppose, is how you’d describe it. He was very bony but better than nothing.  At Christmas he went out of his way to buy me a really nice model railway.
Mr. Holohan, assistant secretary of the Eire Abu Society, had been walking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of concerts. He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy Holohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs. Kearney who arranged everything.  Miss Devlin had become Mrs. Kearney out of spite. She had been educated in a high-class convent, where she had learned French and music. As she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school. When she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many houses, where her playing and ivory manners were much admired. She sat amid the chilly circle of her accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life. But the young men whom she met were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement, trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in secret. However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began to loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr. Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay.  He was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took place at intervals in his great brown beard. After the first year of married life, Mrs. Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person, but she never put her own romantic ideas away. He was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first Friday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself. But she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him. At some party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model father. By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twenty-four. He sent the older daughter, Kathleen, to a good convent, where she learned French and music, and afterward paid her fees at the Academy. Every year in the month of July Mrs. Kearney found occasion to say to some friend:  "My good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks."  If it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones. When the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs. Kearney determined to take advantage of her daughter's name and brought an Irish teacher to the house. Kathleen and her sister sent Irish picture postcards to their friends and these friends sent back other Irish picture postcards. On special Sundays, when Mr. Kearney went with his family to the pro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of Cathedral Street. They were all friends of the Kearneys—musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said good-bye to one another in Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began to be heard often on people's lips. People said that she was very clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a believer in the language movement. Mrs. Kearney was well content at this. Therefore she was not surprised when one day Mr. Holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his Society was going to give in the Antient Concert Rooms. She brought him into the drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel. She entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded: and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concerts. As Mr. Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs. Kearney helped him. She had tact. She knew what artistes should go into capitals and what artistes should go into small type. She knew that the first tenor would not like to come on after Mr. Meade's comic turn. To keep the audience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites. Mr. Holohan called to see her every day to have her advice on some point. She was invariably friendly and advising—homely, in fact. She pushed the decanter towards him, saying:  "Now, help yourself, Mr. Holohan!"  And while he was helping himself she said:  "Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid of it!"  Everything went on smoothly. Mrs. Kearney bought some lovely blush-pink charmeuse in Brown Thomas's to let into the front of Kathleen's dress. It cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a little expense is justifiable. She took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final concert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise. She forgot nothing, and, thanks to her, everything that was to be done was done. The concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. When Mrs. Kearney arrived with her daughter at the Antient Concert Rooms on Wednesday night she did not like the look of things. A few young men, wearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle in the vestibule; none of them wore evening dress. She passed by with her daughter and a quick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of the stewards' idleness. At first she wondered had she mistaken the hour. No, it was twenty minutes to eight.  In the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the secretary of the Society, Mr. Fitzpatrick. She smiled and shook his hand. He was a little man, with a white, vacant face. She noticed that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that his accent was flat. He held a programme in his hand, and, while he was talking to her, he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp. He seemed to bear disappointments lightly. Mr. Holohan came into the dressing-room every few minutes with reports from the box-office. The artistes talked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music. When it was nearly half-past eight, the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be entertained. Mr. Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and said:  "Well now, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose we'd better open the ball."  Mrs. Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of contempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:  "Are you ready, dear?"  When she had an opportunity, she called Mr. Holohan aside and asked him to tell her what it meant. Mr. Holohan did not know what it meant. He said that the committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concerts: four was too many.  "And the artistes!" said Mrs. Kearney. "Of course they are doing their best, but really they are not good."  Mr. Holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the committee, he said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs. Kearney said nothing, but, as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert. There was something she didn't like in the look of things and Mr. Fitzpatrick's vacant smile irritated her very much. However, she said nothing and waited to see how it would end. The concert expired shortly before ten, and everyone went home quickly.  The concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs. Kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper. The audience behaved indecorously, as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal. Mr. Fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was quite unconscious that Mrs. Kearney was taking angry note of his conduct. He stood at the edge of the screen, from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. In the course of the evening, Mrs. Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be abandoned and that the committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought out Mr. Holohan. She buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. Yes, it was true.  "But, of course, that doesn't alter the contract," she said. "The contract was for four concerts."  Mr. Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to Mr. Fitzpatrick. Mrs. Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. She called Mr. Fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concerts and that, of course, according to the terms of the contract, she should receive the sum originally stipulated for, whether the society gave the four concerts or not. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who did not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the committee. Mrs. Kearney's anger began to flutter in her cheek and she had all she could do to keep from asking:  "And who is the Cometty pray?"  But she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she was silent.  Little boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on Friday morning with bundles of handbills. Special puffs appeared in all the evening papers, reminding the music-loving public of the treat which was in store for it on the following evening. Mrs. Kearney was somewhat reassured, but she thought well to tell her husband part of her suspicions. He listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on Saturday night. She agreed. She respected her husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed; and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She was glad that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans over.  The night of the grand concert came. Mrs. Kearney, with her husband and daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it was a rainy evening. Mrs. Kearney placed her daughter's clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for Mr. Holohan or Mr. Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the stewards was any member of the committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs. Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything. Mrs. Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered:  "No, thank you!"  The little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a little sigh and said:  "Ah, well! We did our best, the dear knows."  Mrs. Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room.  The artistes were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had already come. The bass, Mr. Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered black moustache. He was the son of a hall porter in an office in the city and, as a boy, he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding hall. From this humble state he had raised himself until he had become a first-rate artiste. He had appeared in grand opera. One night, when an operatic artiste had fallen ill, he had undertaken the part of the king in the opera of Maritana at the Queen's Theatre. He sang his music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the gallery; but, unfortunately, he marred the good impression by wiping his nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness. He was unassuming and spoke little. He said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his voice's sake. Mr. Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man who competed every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil. On his fourth trial he had been awarded a bronze medal. He was extremely nervous and extremely jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with an ebullient friendliness. It was his humour to have people know what an ordeal a concert was to him. Therefore when he saw Mr. Duggan he went over to him and asked:  "Are you in it too?"  "Yes," said Mr. Duggan. Mr. Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said:  "Shake!"  Mrs. Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the screen to view the house. The seats were being filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium. She came back and spoke to her husband privately. Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen for they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her Nationalist friends, Miss Healy, the contralto. An unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room. The women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body. Someone said that she was Madam Glynn, the soprano.  "I wonder where did they dig her up," said Kathleen to Miss Healy. "I'm sure I never heard of her." Miss Healy had to smile. Mr. Holohan limped into the dressing-room at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown woman. Mr. Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn from London. Madam Glynn took her stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled gaze. The shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her collar-bone. The noise of the hall became more audible. The first tenor and the baritone arrived together. They were both well dressed, stout and complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company.  Mrs. Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove to be polite, her eyes followed Mr. Holohan in his limping and devious courses. As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him.  "Mr. Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment," she said.  They went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs. Kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr. Holohan said that Mr. Fitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs. Kearney said that she didn't know anything about Mr. Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr. Holohan said that it wasn't his business.  "Why isn't it your business?" asked Mrs. Kearney. "Didn't you yourself bring her the contract? Anyway, if it's not your business it's my business and I mean to see to it."  "You'd better speak to Mr. Fitzpatrick," said Mr. Holohan distantly.  "I don't know anything about Mr. Fitzpatrick," repeated Mrs. Kearney. "I have my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out."  When she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone. They were the Freeman men and Mr. O'Madden Burke. The Freeman man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House, He said they were to leave the report for him at the Freeman office and he would see that it went in. He was a grey-haired man, with a plausible voice and careful manners. He held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him. He had not intended to stay a moment because concerts and artistes bored him considerably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece. Miss Healy stood in front of him, talking and laughing. He was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account. The warmth, fragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses. He was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him, that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute. When he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully.  "O'Madden Burke will write the notice," he explained to Mr. Holohan, "and I'll see it in."  "Thank you very much, Mr. Hendrick," said Mr. Holohan. "You'll see it in, I know. Now, won't you have a little something before you go?"  "I don't mind," said Mr. Hendrick.  The two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen. One of these gentlemen was Mr. O'Madden Burke, who had found out the room by instinct. He was a suave, elderly man who balanced his imposing body, when at rest, upon a large silk umbrella. His magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his finances. He was widely respected.  While Mr. Holohan was entertaining the Freeman man Mrs. Kearney was speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower her voice. The conversation of the others in the dressing-room had become strained. Mr. Bell, the first item, stood ready with his music but the accompanist made no sign. Evidently something was wrong. Mr. Kearney looked straight before him, stroking his beard, while Mrs. Kearney spoke into Kathleen's ear with subdued emphasis. From the hall came sounds of encouragement, clapping and stamping of feet. The first tenor and the baritone and Miss Healy stood together, waiting tranquilly, but Mr. Bell's nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience would think that he had come late.  Mr. Holohan and Mr. O'Madden Burke came into the room. In a moment Mr. Holohan perceived the hush. He went over to Mrs. Kearney and spoke with her earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder. Mr. Holohan became very red and excited. He spoke volubly, but Mrs. Kearney said curtly at intervals:  "She won't go on. She must get her eight guineas."  Mr. Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping and stamping. He appealed to Mr. Kearney and to Kathleen. But Mr. Kearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down, moving the point of her new shoe: it was not her fault. Mrs. Kearney repeated:  "She won't go on without her money."  After a swift struggle of tongues Mr. Holohan hobbled out in haste. The room was silent. When the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful Miss Healy said to the baritone:  "Have you seen Mrs. Pat Campbell this week?"  The baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine. The conversation went no further. The first tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus. From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs. Kearney.  The noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr. Fitzpatrick burst into the room, followed by Mr. Holohan, who was panting. The clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. Mr. Fitzpatrick held a few bank-notes in his hand. He counted out four into Mrs. Kearney's hand and said she would get the other half at the interval. Mrs. Kearney said:  "This is four shillings short."  But Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: "Now, Mr. Bell," to the first item, who was shaking like an aspen. The singer and the accompanist went out together. The noise in the hall died away. There was a pause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard.  The first part of the concert was very successful except for Madam Glynn's item. The poor lady sang Killarney in a bodiless gasping voice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and pronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing. She looked as if she had been resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and the cheaper parts of the hall made fun of her high wailing notes. The first tenor and the contralto, however, brought down the house. Kathleen played a selection of Irish airs which was generously applauded. The first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. It was deservedly applauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the interval, content.  All this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. In one corner were Mr. Holohan, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the stewards, the baritone, the bass, and Mr. O'Madden Burke. Mr. O'Madden Burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed. Miss Kathleen Kearney's musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he said. The baritone was asked what did he think of Mrs. Kearney's conduct. He did not like to say anything. He had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with men. However, he said that Mrs. Kearney might have taken the artistes into consideration. The stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came.  "I agree with Miss Beirne," said Mr. O'Madden Burke. "Pay her nothing."  In another corner of the room were Mrs. Kearney and her husband, Mr. Bell, Miss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece. Mrs. Kearney said that the committee had treated her scandalously. She had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid.  They thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore, they could ride roughshod over her. But she would show them their mistake. They wouldn't have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man. But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she wouldn't be fooled. If they didn't pay her to the last farthing she would make Dublin ring. Of course she was sorry for the sake of the artistes. But what else could she do? She appealed to the second tenor, who said he thought she had not been well treated. Then she appealed to Miss Healy. Miss Healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great friend of Kathleen's and the Kearneys had often invited her to their house.  As soon as the first part was ended Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Holohan went over to Mrs. Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in case her daughter did not play for the second part, the committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing.  "I haven't seen any committee," said Mrs. Kearney angrily. "My daughter has her contract. She will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot she won't put on that platform." "I'm surprised at you, Mrs. Kearney," said Mr. Holohan. "I never thought you would treat us this way."  "And what way did you treat me?" asked Mrs. Kearney.  Her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands.  "I'm asking for my rights," she said.  "You might have some sense of decency," said Mr. Holohan.  "Might I, indeed? . . . And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid I can't get a civil answer."  She tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:  "You must speak to the secretary. It's not my business. I'm a great fellow fol-the-diddle-I-do."  "I thought you were a lady," said Mr. Holohan, walking away from her abruptly.  After that Mrs. Kearney's conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone approved of what the committee had done. She stood at the door, haggard with rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with them. She waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments. Mrs. Kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform. She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her daughter's cloak and said to her husband:  "Get a cab!"  He went out at once. Mrs. Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and followed him. As she passed through the doorway she stopped and glared into Mr. Holohan's face.  "I'm not done with you yet," she said.  "But I'm done with you," said Mr. Holohan.  Kathleen followed her mother meekly. Mr. Holohan began to pace up and down the room, in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire.  "That's a nice lady!" he said. "O, she's a nice lady!"  "You did the proper thing, Holohan," said Mr. O'Madden Burke, poised upon his umbrella in approval.
As Mr. Nilson, well known in the City, opened the window of his dressing-room on Campden Hill, he experienced a peculiar sweetish sensation in the back of his throat, and a feeling of emptiness just under his fifth rib. Hooking the window back, he noticed that a little tree in the Square Gardens had come out in blossom, and that the thermometer stood at sixty. 'Perfect morning,' he thought; 'spring at last!'  Resuming some meditations on the price of Tintos, he took up an ivory-backed hand-glass and scrutinised his face. His firm, well-coloured cheeks, with their neat brown moustaches, and his round, well-opened, clear grey eyes, wore a reassuring appearance of good health. Putting on his black frock coat, he went downstairs.  In the dining-room his morning paper was laid out on the sideboard. Mr. Nilson had scarcely taken it in his hand when he again became aware of that queer feeling. Somewhat concerned, he went to the French window and descended the scrolled iron steps into the fresh air. A cuckoo clock struck eight.  'Half an hour to breakfast,' he thought; 'I'll take a turn in the Gardens.'  He had them to himself, and proceeded to pace the circular path with his morning paper clasped behind him. He had scarcely made two revolutions, however, when it was borne in on him that, instead of going away in the fresh air, the feeling had increased. He drew several deep breaths, having heard deep breathing recommended by his wife's doctor; but they augmented rather than diminished the sensation--as if some sweetish liquor in course within him, together with a faint aching just above his heart. Running over what he had eaten the night before, he could recollect no unusual dish, and it occurred to him that it might possibly be some smell affecting him. But he could detect nothing except a faint sweet lemony scent, rather agreeable than otherwise, which evidently emanated from the bushes budding in the sunshine. He was on the point of resuming his promenade, when a blackbird close by burst into song, and, looking up, Mr. Nilson saw at a distance of perhaps five yards a little tree, in the heart of whose branches the bird was perched. He stood staring curiously at this tree, recognising it for that which he had noticed from his window. It was covered with young blossoms, pink and white, and little bright green leaves both round and spiky; and on all this blossom and these leaves the sunlight glistened. Mr. Nilson smiled; the little tree was so alive and pretty! And instead of passing on, he stayed there smiling at the tree.  'Morning like this!' he thought; 'and here I am the only person in the Square who has the--to come out and--!' But he had no sooner conceived this thought than he saw quite near him a man with his hands behind him, who was also staring up and smiling at the little tree. Rather taken aback, Mr. Nilson ceased to smile, and looked furtively at the stranger. It was his next-door neighbour, Mr. Tandram, well known in the City, who had occupied the adjoining house for some five years. Mr. Nilson perceived at once the awkwardness of his position, for, being married, they had not yet had occasion to speak to one another. Doubtful as to his proper conduct, he decided at last to murmur: "Fine morning!" and was passing on, when Mr. Tandram answered: "Beautiful, for the time of year!" Detecting a slight nervousness in his neighbour's voice, Mr. Nilson was emboldened to regard him openly. He was of about Mr. Nilson's own height, with firm well-coloured cheeks, neat brown moustaches, and round, well-opened, clear grey eyes; and he was wearing a black frock coat. Mr. Nilson noticed that he had his morning paper clasped behind him as he looked up at the little tree. And, visited somehow by the feeling that he had been caught out, he said abruptly:  "Er--can you give me the name of that tree?"  Mr. Tandram answered:  "I was about to ask you that," and stepped towards it. Mr. Nilson also approached the tree.  "Sure to have its name on, I should think," he said.  Mr. Tandram was the first to see the little label, close to where the blackbird had been sitting. He read it out.  "Japanese quince!"  "Ah!" said Mr. Nilson, "thought so. Early flowerers."  "Very," assented Mr. Tandram, and added: "Quite a feelin' in the air to-day."  Mr. Nilson nodded.  "It was a blackbird singin'," he said.  "Blackbirds," answered Mr. Tandram, "I prefer them to thrushes myself; more body in the note." And he looked at Mr. Nilson in an almost friendly way.  "Quite," murmured Mr. Nilson. "These exotics, they don't bear fruit. Pretty blossom!" and he again glanced up at the blossom, thinking: 'Nice fellow, this, I rather like him.'  Mr. Tandram also gazed at the blossom. And the little tree as if appreciating their attention, quivered and glowed. From a distance the blackbird gave a loud, clear call. Mr. Nilson dropped his eyes. It struck him suddenly that Mr. Tandram looked a little foolish; and, as if he had seen himself, he said: "I must be going in. Good morning!"  A shade passed over Mr. Tandram's face, as if he, too, had suddenly noticed something about Mr. Nilson.  "Good morning," he replied, and clasping their journals to their backs they separated.  Mr. Nilson retraced his steps toward his garden window, walking slowly so as to avoid arriving at the same time as his neighbour. Having seen Mr. Tandram mount his scrolled iron steps, he ascended his own in turn. On the top step he paused.  With the slanting spring sunlight darting and quivering into it, the Japanese quince seemed more living than a tree. The blackbird had returned to it, and was chanting out his heart.  Mr. Nilson sighed; again he felt that queer sensation, that choky feeling in his throat.  The sound of a cough or sigh attracted his attention. There, in the shadow of his French window, stood Mr. Tandram, also looking forth across the Gardens at the little quince tree.  Unaccountably upset, Mr. Nilson turned abruptly into the house, and opened his morning paper.

The Mathematician by JOHN VON NEUMANN     COMMENTARY ON   G. H. HARDY     GH. HARDY was a pure mathematician. The boundaries of this  subject cannot be precisely defined but for Hardy the word "pure"  as applied to mathematics had a clear, though negative, meaning. To  qualify as pure, Hardy said, a mathematical topic had to be useless; if  useless, it was not only pure, but beautiful. If useful which is to say  impure it was ugly, and the more useful, the more ugly. These opinions  were not always well received. The noted chemist Frederick Soddy, re  viewing the book from which the following excerpts are taken, pro  nounced as scandalous Hardy's expressed contempt for useful mathe  matics or indeed for any applied science. "From such cloistral clowning,"  wrote Soddy, "the world sickens." 1 Hardy was a strange, original and  enigmatic man. He was also a fine mathematician and a charming writer.   Godfrey Harold Hardy was bora in Surrey in February 1877. His  parents were teachers and "mathematically minded." He was educated first  at Winchester which he hated and then at Cambridge, where he taught  the greater part of his life. From 1919 to 1931 he held the Savilian chair  of geometry at Oxford; in 1931 he was elected to the Sadlerian chair of  pure mathematics at Cambridge and resumed the Fellowship at Trinity  College which he had held from 1898 to 1919.   Hardy 's main work was in analysis and arithmetic. He is known to  students for his classic text, A Course of Pure Mathematics, which set a  new standard for English mathematical education. But his reputation as  the leader of pure mathematicians in Great Britain rests on his original  and advanced researches. He wrote profound and masterly papers on such  topics as the convergence and summability of series, inequalities and the  analytic theory of numbers. The problems of number theory are often  very easily stated (e.g., to prove that every even number is the sum of  two prime numbers) "but all the resources of analysis are required to  make any impression on them." 2 The problem quoted, and others of  equally innocent appearance, are still unsolved "but they are not now as  they were in 1910 unapproachable." 3 This advance is due mainly to the  joint work of Hardy and the British mathematician J. E. Littlewood, Their  collaboration was exceptionally long and immensely fruitful; it is consid  ered the most remarkable of all mathematical partnerships. An equally  brilliant but unhappily brief partnership existed between Hardy and the   1 Nature, Vol. 147, January 4, 1941.   2 Obituary of G. H. Hardy, Nature, Vol. 161, May 22, 1948, pp. 797-98.   3 Ibid.   2024     G. H. Hardy 2025   self-taught Indian genius Ramanujan (see p. 368). It is hard to imagine  two men further apart in training and background, yet Hardy was one of  the first to discern what he termed Ramanujan's "profound and invincible  originality." Ramanujan "called out Hardy's equal but quite different  powers." "I owe more to him," Hardy said, "than to anyone else in the  world with one exception, and my association with him is the one ro  mantic incident of my life." 4   I once encountered Hardy in the early 1930s at the subway entrance  near Columbia University in New York City. It was a raw, wet winter  day, but he was bareheaded, had no overcoat and wore a white cable-  stitched turtle-necked sweater and a baggy pair of tennis slacks. I recall  his delicately cut but strong features, his high coloring and the hair that  fell in irregular bangs over his forehead. He was a strikingly handsome  and graceful man who would have drawn attention even in more con  ventional dress. Hardy had strong opinions and vehement prejudices; some  were admirable, some merely eccentric, and, I cannot help thinking, de  liberately assumed. In political opinion as well as in his mathematical  philosophy, he shared Bertrand Russell's views. His hatred of war was one  reason why he regarded applied mathematics (ballistics or aerodynamics,  for example) as "repulsively ugly and intolerably dull." 5 Hardy "always  referred to God as his personal enemy. This was of course a joke but  there was something real behind it. ... He would not enter a religious  building, even for such purpose as the election of a Warden of New  College." 6 A special exemption clause had to be written into the by-laws  of the college to enable him to discharge certain duties by proxy which  otherwise would have required him to attend Chapel.   His love of mathematics was almost equaled by his passion for ball  games: cricket, tennis and even baseball. 7 Justice Frankfurter tells the   4 Obituary of G. H. Hardy by E. C. Titchmarsh, The Journal of the London Mathe  matical Society, April 1950, pp. 81-88. One of the joint papers of Hardy and Rama  nujan is worth noting briefly. "Denote by p(ri) the number of ways of denoting the  positive integer n as the sum of integers. For example, 5 can be expressed as 1 + 1 +  1 + 1 + 1 or 1 + 1 + 1+2 or 1+2 + 2 or 1 + 1+3 or 2 + 3 or 1+4 or 5,  and so p(5) = 7. It is plain that p(n) increases rapidly with H; and p(200) =  3972999029388 (as was shown by a computation which took a month). Hardy and  Ramanujan's achievement was to establish an explicit formula for p(w), of which the  leading term is:      27TVT dn   Five terms of the formula give the correct value of p(200).   5 Titchmarsh, op. cit., p. 84.   6 Ibid., p. 86.   7 Hardy frequently enlivened his discussions of philosophy or mathematics by illus  trations taken from cricket. One of his papers "A maximal theorem with function-  theoretic applications" contains the sentence "The problem is most easily grasped     Editor's Comment  2026   story of Hardy's visit to Boston in 1936 when he delivered his Ramanujan  lectures at the Harvard Tercentenary. He was to be the house guest of a  well-known lawyer, later a United States Senator, and was terrified that he  would find little to talk about with his host. The host was similarly  alarmed, but the visit turned out to be easy and pleasant for both. For  while the lawyer was no better prepared to discuss Zeta functions than the  mathematician to comment upon the rule in Shelley's case, they discov  ered a common enthusiasm for baseball. The Red Sox were playing a  home stand at the time and Hardy could barely spare the time for his  lectures.   "I have never done anything 'useful.' No discovery of mine has made,  or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least differ  ence to the amenity of the world." These lines appear in Hardy's half-  defiant, half-ironical apology for his misspent life as a pure mathematician.  The statement is nonsense. Hardy, I do not doubt, knew it was nonsense.  Contributions such as his are certain to be useful; unexpectedly, and con  sidering the world of today, perhaps even disagreeably useful. To make  matters worse by his standards, it appears that Hardy once made a con  tribution to genetics. Writing a letter to Science in 1908 on a problem  involving the transmission of dominant and recessive Mendelian char  acters in a mixed population, he established a principle known as Hardy's  Law. This law (though he attached "little weight to it") turns out to be of  "central importance in the study of Rh-blood groups and the treatment of  haemolytic disease of the newborn." 8   Hardy received many degrees and honors, including of course election  to a Fellowship in the Royal Society in 1910. He died on December 1,  1947, the day the Copley Medal of the Royal Society, its highest award,  was to have been presented to him.   when stated in the language of cricket. . . . Suppose that a batsman plays, in a given  season, a given 'stock' of innings." This paper, published in Acta Mathematica (54)  and "presumably addressed to European mathematicians in general" must not have  been very helpful to the Hungarians, say, who may not have appreciated all the fine  points of the example.   8 Titchmarsh, op. cit., p. 83. J. B. S. Haldane gives another example of the useful,  if unintentional, consequences of Hardy's work. There is a function called Riemann's  Zeta function "which was devised, and its properties investigated, to find an expres  sion for the number of prime numbers less than a given number. Hardy loved it. But  it has been used in the theory of pyrometry, that is to say the investigation of the  temperature of furnaces." Everything Has a History, London, 1951, p. 240.     Mark all Mathematical heads -which be -wholly and only bent on these sci  ences, how solitary they be themselves, how unfit to live with others, how  unapt to serve the world.   ROGER ASCHAM (ca. 1550) (Quoted in E. G. R. Taylor, "The  Mathematical Practitioners of Tudor and Stuart England")   I admit that mathematical science is a good thing. But excessive devotion  to it is a bad thing. ALDOUS HUXLEY (Interview, J. W. N. Sullivan)     1 A Mathematician's Apology   By G. H. HARDY     A MATHEMATICIAN, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns.  If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are  made with ideas. A painter makes patterns with shapes and colours, a  poet with words. A painting may embody an Idea,' but the idea is usually  commonplace and unimportant. In poetry, ideas count for a good deal  more; but, as Housman insisted, the importance of ideas in poetry is  habitually exaggerated: 'I cannot satisfy myself that there are any such  things as poetical ideas. . . . Poetry is not the thing said but a way of  saying it.'   Not all the water in the rough rude sea  Can wash the balm from an anointed King.   Could lines be better, and could ideas be at once more trite and more  false? The poverty of the ideas seems hardly to affect the beauty of the  verbal pattern. A mathematician, on the other hand, has no material to  work with but ideas, and so his patterns are likely to last longer, since  ideas wear less with time than words.   The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's, must be  beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words, must fit together in a  harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in  the world for ugly mathematics. And here I must deal with a misconcep  tion which is still widespread (though probably much less so now than it  was twenty years ago), what Whitehead has called the 'literary supersti  tion' that love of and aesthetic appreciation of mathematics is 'a mono  mania confined to a few eccentrics in each generation.'   It would be difficult now to find an educated man quite insensitive to  the aesthetic appeal of mathematics. It may be very hard to define mathe  matical beauty, but that is just as true of beauty of any kind we may not  know quite what we mean by a beautiful poem, but that does not prevent  us from recognizing one when we read it. Even Professor Hogben, who is   2027     G. H. Hardy  2028   out to minimize at all costs the importance of the aesthetic element in  mathematics, does not venture to deny its reality. There are, to be sure,  individuals for whom mathematics exercises a coldly impersonal attrac  tion. ... The aesthetic appeal of mathematics may be very real for a  chosen few/ But they are 'few,' he suggests, and they feel 'coldly' (and are  really rather ridiculous people, who live in silly little university towns  sheltered from the fresh breezes of the wide open spaces). In this he is  merely echoing Whitehead's literary superstition.'   The fact is that there are few more 'popular' subjects than mathematics.  Most people have some appreciation of mathematics, just as most people  can enjoy a pleasant tune; and there are probably more people really in  terested in mathematics than in music. Appearances may suggest the con  trary, but there are easy explanations. Music can be used to stimulate mass  emotion, while mathematics cannot; and musical incapacity is recognized  (no doubt rightly) as mildly discreditable, whereas most people are so  frightened of the name of mathematics that they are ready, quite un  affectedly, to exaggerate their own mathematical stupidity.   A very little reflection is enough to expose the absurdity of the 'literary  superstition.' There are masses of chess-players in every civilized country  in Russia, almost the whole educated population; and every chess  player can recognize and appreciate a 'beautiful' game or problem. Yet a  chess problem is simply an exercise in pure mathematics (a game not en  tirely, since psychology also plays a part), and everyone who calls a prob  lem 'beautiful' is applauding mathematical beauty, even if it is beauty of  a comparatively lowly kind. Chess problems are the hymn-tunes of mathe  matics.   We may learn the same lesson, at a lower level but for a wider public,  from bridge, or descending further, from the puzzle columns of the popu  lar newspapers. Nearly all their immense popularity is a tribute to the  drawing power of rudimentary mathematics, and the better makers of  puzzles, such as Dudeney or 'Caliban,' use very little else. They know  their business: what the public wants is a little intellectual 'kick,' and  nothing else has quite the kick of mathematics.   I might add that there is nothing in the world which pleases even  famous men (and men who have used disparaging language about mathe  matics) quite so much as to discover, or rediscover, a genuine mathemati  cal theorem. Herbert Spencer republished in his autobiography a theorem  about circles which he proved when he was twenty (not knowing that it  had been proved over two thousand years before by Plato). Professor  Soddy is a more recent and a more striking example (but his theorem  really is his own). 1   1 See his letters on the 'Hexlet' in Nature, vols. 137-9 (1936-7).     A Mathematician's Apology 2029   A chess problem is genuine mathematics, but it is in some way 'trivial'  mathematics. However ingenious and intricate, however original and sur  prising the moves, there is something essential lacking. Chess problems are  unimportant. The best mathematics is serious as well as beautiful 'im  portant 5 if you like, but the word is very ambiguous, and 'serious' ex  presses what I mean much better.   I am not thinking of the 'practical' consequences of mathematics. I  have to return to that point later: at present I will say only that if a chess  problem is, in the crude sense, 'useless,' then that is equally true of most  of the best mathematics; that very little of mathematics is useful prac  tically, and that that little is comparatively dull. The 'seriousness' of a  mathematical theorem lies, not in its practical consequences, which are  usually negligible, but in the significance of the mathematical ideas which  it connects. We may say, roughly, that a mathematical idea is 'significant'  if it can be connected, in a natural and illuminating way, with a large  complex of other mathematical ideas. Thus a serious mathematical  theorem, a theorem which connects significant ideas, is likely to lead to  important advances in mathematics itself and even in other sciences. No  chess problem has ever affected the general development of scientific  thought: Pythagoras, Newton, Einstein have in their times changed its  whole direction.   The seriousness of a theorem, of course, does not lie in its consequences,  which are merely the evidence for its seriousness. Shakespeare had an  enormous influence on the development of the English language, Otway  next to none, but that is not why Shakespeare was the better poet. He was  the better poet because he wrote much better poetry. The inferiority of  the chess problem, like that of Otway's poetry, lies not in its consequences  but in its content.   There is one more point which I shall dismiss very shortly, not because  it is uninteresting but because it is difficult, and because I have no quali  fications for any serious discussion in aesthetics. The beauty of a mathe  matical theorem depends a great deal on its seriousness, as even in poetry  the beauty of a line may depend to some extent on the significance of the  ideas which it contains. I quoted two lines of Shakespeare as an example  of the sheer beauty of a verbal pattern; but   After life's fitful fever he sleeps well   seems still more beautiful. The pattern is just as fine, and in this case the  ideas have significance and the thesis is sound, so that our emotions are  stirred much more deeply. The ideas do matter to the pattern, even in  poetry, and much more, naturally, in mathematics; but I must not try to  argue the question seriously.     2030 <?. H. Hardy   It will be clear by now that, if we are to have any chance of making  progress, I must produce examples of 'real' mathematical theorems, theo  rems which every mathematician will admit to be first-rate. And here I  am very heavily handicapped by the restrictions under which I am writing.  On the one hand my examples must be very simple, and intelligible to a  reader who has no specialized mathematical knowledge; no elaborate pre  liminary explanations must be needed; and a reader must be able to follow  the proofs as well as the enunciations. These conditions exclude, for in  stance, many of the most beautiful theorems of the theory of numbers,  such as Fermat's 'two square' theorem or the law of quadratic reciprocity.  And on the other hand my examples should be drawn from 'pukka' mathe  matics, the mathematics of the working professional mathematician; and  this condition excludes a good deal which it would be comparatively easy  to make intelligible but which trespasses on logic and mathematical  philosophy.   I can hardly do better than go back to the Greeks. I will state and prove  two of the famous theorems of Greek mathematics. They are 'simple*  theorems, simple both in idea and in execution, but there is no doubt at  all about their being theorems of the highest class. Each is as fresh and  significant as when it was discovered two thousand years have not  written a wrinkle on either of them. Finally, both the statements and the  proofs can be mastered in an hour by any intelligent reader, however  slender his mathematical equipment.   1. The first is Euclid's 2 pi oof of the existence of an infinity of prime  numbers.   The prime numbers or primes are the numbers   (A) 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...   which cannot be resolved into smaller factors. 3 Thus 37 and 317 are prime.  The primes are the material out of which all numbers are built up by  multiplication: thus 666 2.3.3.37. Every number which is not prime  itself is divisible by at least one prime (usually, of course, by several). We  have to prove that there are infinitely many primes, i.e., that the series  (A) never comes to an end.  Let us suppose that it does, and that   2, 3, 5, . . . , P   is the complete series (so that P is the largest prime); and let us, on this  hypothesis, consider the number Q defined by the formula   2=(2.3.5 P) + l.   2 Elements ix 20. The real origin of many theorems in the Elements is obscure, but  there seems to be no particular reason for supposing that this one is not Euclid's own.   3 There are technical reasons for not counting 1 as a prime.     A Mathematician's Apology 2031   It is plain that Q is not divisible by any of 2, 3, 5, . . ., P; for it leaves  the remainder 1 when divided by any one of these numbers. But, if not  itself prime, it is divisible by some prime, and therefore there is a prime  (which may be Q itself) greater than any of them. This contradicts our  hypothesis, that there is no prime greater than P; and therefore this hy  pothesis is false.   The proof is by reductio ad absurdum, and reductio ad absurdum,  which Euclid loved so much, is one of a mathematician's finest weapons. 4  It is a far finer gambit than any chess gambit: a chess player may offer  the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the  game.   * * * * *   2. My second example is Pythagoras's 5 proof of the 'irrationality' of   >A   a   A 'rational number' is a fraction -, where a and b are integers: we may   b   suppose that a and b have no common factor, since if they had we could  remove it. To say that '\/2 is irrational' is merely another way of saying   / a \ 2   that 2 cannot be expressed in the form I - J ; and this is the same     V:   b I     thing as saying that the equation   (B) a 2 = 2b 2   cannot be satisfied by integral values of a and b which have no common  factor. This is a theorem of pure arithmetic, which does not demand any  knowledge of 'irrational numbers' or depend on any theory about their  nature.   We argue again by reductio ad absurdum; we suppose that (B) is true,  a and b being integers without any common factor. It follows from (B)  that a 2 is even (since 2b 2 is divisible by 2), and therefore that a is even  (since the square of an odd number is odd). If a is even then   (C) a = 2c  for some integral value of c; and therefore   2b 2 = a 2 = (2c) 2 = 4c 2  or   (D) b 2 = 2c 2 .   4 The proof can be arranged so as to avoid a reductio, and logicians of some  schools would prefer that it should be.   5 The proof traditionally ascribed to Pythagoras, and certainly a product of his  school. The theorem occurs, in a much more general form, in Euclid (Elements x 9).     2032 G. H. Hardy   Hence b 2 is even, and therefore (for the same reason as before) b is even.  That is to say, a and b are both even, and so have the common factor  2. This contradicts our hypothesis, and therefore the hypothesis is false.  It follows from Pythagoras's theorem that the diagonal of a square is  incommensurable with the side (that their ratio is not a rational number,  that there is no unit of which both are integral multiples) . For if we take  the side as our unit of length, and the length of the diagonal is d 9 then,  by a very familiar theorem also ascribed to Pythagoras, 6     so that d cannot be a rational number.   I could quote any number of fine theorems from the theory of numbers  whose meaning anyone can understand. For example, there is what is  called 'the fundamental theorem of arithmetic,' that any integer can be re  solved, in one way only, into a product of primes. Thus 666 = 2.3.3.37,  and htere is no other decomposition; it is impossible that 666 = 2. 11 .29  or that 13.89 17.73 (and we can see so without working out the prod  ucts). This theorem is, as its name implies, the foundation of higher  arithmetic; but the proof, although not 'difficult/ requires a certain amount  of preface and might be found tedious by an unmathematical reader.   Another famous and beautiful theorem is Fermat's 'two square' theo  rem. The primes may (if we ignore the special prime 2) be arranged in  two classes; the primes   5, 13, 17,29,37,41, ...   which leave remainder 1 when divided by 4, and the primes  3,7, 11, 19,23, 31, ...   which leave remainder 3. All the primes of the first class, and none of the  second, can be expressed as the sum of two integral squares: thus   5r=p + 2 2 , 13 = 2 2 -f32,   17=1*4- 4 2 , 29 = 2 2 4- 5^;   but 3, 7, 11, and 19 are not expressible in this way (as the reader may  check by trial). This is Fermat's theorem, which is ranked, very justly,  as one of the finest of arithmetic. Unfortunately there is no proof within  the comprehension of anybody but a fairly expert mathematician.   There are also beautiful theorems in the 'theory of aggregates' (Men-  genlehre), such as Cantor's theorem of the 'non-enumerability' of the  continuum. Here there is just the opposite difficulty. The proof is easy  enough, when once the language has been mastered, but considerable ex  planation is necessary before the meaning of the theorem becomes clear.  6 Euclid, Elements I 47,     A Mathematician's Apology 2033   So I will not try to give more examples. Those which I have given are  test cases, and a reader who cannot appreciate them is unlikely to appre  ciate anything in mathematics.   I said that a mathematician was a maker of patterns of ideas, and that  beauty and seriousness were the criteria by which his patterns should be  judged. I can hardly believe that anyone who has understood the two  theorems will dispute that they pass these tests. If we compare them with  Dudeney's most ingenious puzzles, or the finest chess problems that  masters of that art have composed, their superiority in both respects  stands out: there is an unmistakable difference of class. They are much  more serious, and also much more beautiful: can we define, a little more  closely, where their superiority lies?     In the first place, the superiority of the mathematical theorems in seri  ousness is obvious and overwhelming. The chess problem is the product  of an ingenious but very limited complex of ideas, which do not differ  from one another very fundamentally and have no external repercussions.  We should think in the same way if chess had never been invented,  whereas the theorems of Euclid and Pythagoras have influenced .thought  profoundly, even outside mathematics.   Thus Euclid's theorem is vital for the whole structure of arithmetic.  The primes are the raw material out of which we have to build arithmetic,  and Euclid's theorem assures us that we have plenty of material for the  task. But the theorem of Pythagoras has wider applications and provides  a better text.   We should observe first that Pythagoras's argument is capable of far-  reaching extension, and can be applied, with little change of principle, to  very wide classes of Irrationals.' We can prove very similarly (as Theae  tetus seems to have done) that   \/3 \/5> V% \/H> \/T3 "N/17   are irrational, or (going beyond Theaetetus) that ^/2 and \/T7 are irra-  rational. 7   Euclid's theorem tells us that we have a good supply of material for  the construction of a coherent arithmetic of the integers. Pythagoras's  theorem and its extensions tells us that, when we have constructed this  arithmetic, it will not prove sufficient for our needs, since there will be  many magnitudes which obtrude themselves upon our attention and which  it will be unable to measure: the diagonal of the square is merely the most  obvious example. The profound importance of this discovery was recog-   7 See Ch. rv of Hardy and Wright's Introduction to the Theory of Numbers, where  there are discussions of different generalizations of Pythagoras's argument, and of a  historical puzzle about Theaetetus.     2034 G. H. Hardy   nized at once by the Greek mathematicians. They had begun by assuming  (in accordance, I suppose, with the 'natural 5 dictates of 'common sense')  that all magnitudes of the same kind are commensurable, that any two  lengths, for example, are multiples of some common unit, and they had  constructed a theory of proportion based on this assumption. Pythagoras's  discovery exposed the unsoundness of this foundation, and led to the con  struction of the much more profound theory of Eudoxus which is set out  in the fifth book of the Elements, and which is regarded by many modern  mathematicians as the finest achievement of Greek mathematics. This  theory is astonishingly modern in spirit, and may be regarded as the be  ginning of the modern theory of irrational number, which has revolution  ized mathematical analysis and had much influence on recent philosophy.  There is no doubt at all, then, of the 'seriousness' of either theorem. It  is therefore the better worth remarking that neither theorem has the  slightest 'practical' importance. In practical applications we are concerned  only with comparatively small numbers; only stellar astronomy and atomic  physics deal with large' numbers, and they have very little more practical  importance, as yet, than the most abstract pure mathematics. I do not  know what is the highest degree of accuracy which is ever useful to an  engineer we shall be very generous if we say ten significant figures. Then   3-141592654  (the value of ir to nine places of decimals) is the ratio   3141592654     1000000000   of two numbers of ten digits. The number of primes less than 1,000,000,-  000 is 50,847,478: that is enough for an engineer, and he can be perfectly  happy without the rest. So much for Euclid's theorem; and, as regards  Pythagoras's, it is obvious that irrationals are uninteresting to an engineer,  since he is concerned only with approximations, and all approximations  are rational.   *****   The contrast between pure and applied mathematics stands out most  clearly, perhaps, in geometry. There is the science of pure geometry, 8 in  which there are many geometries, projective geometry, Euclidean geom  etry, non-Euclidean geometry, and so forth. Each of these geometries is a  model, a pattern of ideas, and is to be judged by the interest and beauty  of its particular pattern. It is a map or picture, the joint product of many  hands, a partial and imperfect copy (yet exact so far as it extends) of a  section of mathematical reality. But the point which is important to us   8 We must of course, for the purposes of this discussion, count as pure geometry  what mathematicians call 'analytical' geometry. geometry     A Mathematician's Apology 2035   now is this, that there is one thing at any rate of which pure geometries  are not pictures, and that is the spatio-temporal reality of the physical  world. It is obvious, surely, that they cannot be, since earthquakes and  eclipses are not mathematical concepts.   This may sound a little paradoxical to an outsider, but it is a truism to  a geometer; and I may perhaps be able to make it clearer by an illustra  tion. Let us suppose that I am giving a lecture on some system of geom  etry, such as ordinary Euclidean geometry, and that I draw figures on the  blackboard to stimulate the imagination of my audience, rough drawings  of straight lines or circles or ellipses. It is plain, first, that the truth of  the theorems which I prove is in no way affected by the quality of my  drawings. Their function is merely to bring home my meaning to my  hearers, and, if I can do that, there would be no gain in having them  redrawn by the most skilful draughtsman. They are pedagogical illustra  tions, not part of the real subject-matter of the lecture.   Now let us go a stage further. The room in which I am lecturing is part  of the physical world, and has itself a certain pattern. The study of that  pattern, and of the general pattern of physical reality, is a science in itself,  which we may call 'physical geometry.' Suppose now that a violent  dynamo, or a massive gravitating body, is introduced into the room. Then  the physicists tell us that the geometry of the room is changed, its whole  physical pattern slightly but definitely distorted. Do the theorems which  I have proved become false? Surely it would be nonsense to suppose that  the proofs of them which I have given are affected in any way. It would  be like supposing that a play of Shakespeare is changed when a reader  spills his tea over a page. The play is independent of the pages on which  it is printed, and 'pure geometries' are independent of lecture rooms, or  of any other detail of the physical world.   This is the point of view of a pure mathematician. Applied mathemati  cians, mathematical physicists, naturally take a different view, since they  are preoccupied with the physical world itself, which also has its structure  or pattern. We cannot describe this pattern exactly, as we can that of a  pure geometry, but we can say something significant about it. We can  describe, sometimes fairly accurately, sometimes very roughly, the rela  tions which hold between some of its constituents, and compare them with  the exact relations holding between constituents of some system of pure  geometry. We may be able to trace a certain resemblance between the  two sets of relations, and then the pure geometry will become interesting  to physicists; it will give us, to that extent, a map which 'fits the facts' of  the physical world. The geometer offers to the physicist a whole set of  maps from which to choose. One map, perhaps, will fit the facts better  than others, and then the geometry which provides that particular map  will be the geometry most important for applied mathematics. I may add     2036 G, H. Hardy   that even a pure mathematician may find his appreciation, of this geometry  quickened, since there is no mathematician so pure that he feels no interest  at all in the physical world; but, in so far as he succumbs to this tempta  tion, he will be abandoning his purely mathematical position.     I will end with a summary of my conclusions, but putting them in a  more personal way. I said at the beginning that anyone who defends his  subject will find that he is defending himself; and my justification of the  life of a professional mathematician is bound to be, at bottom, a justifica  tion of my own. Thus this concluding section will be in its substance a  fragment of autobiography.   I cannot remember ever having wanted to be anything but a mathe  matician. I suppose that it was always clear that my specific abilities lay  that way, and it never occurred to me to question the verdict of my  elders. I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any passion for mathe  matics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of a mathema  tician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in terms of  examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other boys, and this  seemed to be the way in which I could do so most decisively.   I was about fifteen when (in a rather odd way) my ambitions took a   sharper turn. There is a book by 'Alan St. Aubyn' 9 called A Fellow of   Trinity, one of a series dealing with what is supposed to be Cambridge   college life. I suppose that it is a worse book than most of Marie Corelli's;   but a book can hardly be entirely bad if it fires a clever boy's imagination.   There are two heroes, a primary hero called Flowers, who is almost wholly   good, and a secondary hero, a much weaker vessel, called Brown. Flowers   and Brown find many dangers in university life, but the worst is a gam   bling saloon in Chesterton 30 run by the Misses Bellenden, two fascinating   but extremely wicked young ladies. Flowers survives all these troubles, is   Second Wrangler and Senior Classic, and succeeds automatically to a   Fellowship (as I suppose he would have done then). Brown succumbs,   ruins his parents, takes to drink, is saved from delirium tremens during a   thunderstorm only by the prayers of the Junior Dean, has much difficulty   in obtaining even an Ordinary Degree, and ultimately becomes a mission   ary. The friendship is not shattered by these unhappy events, and Flow-   ers's thoughts stray to Brown, with affectionate pity, as he drinks port and   eats walnuts for the first time in Senior Combination Room.   Now Flowers was a decent enough fellow (so far as 'Alan St. Aubyn'  could draw one), but even my unsophisticated mind refused to accept  him as clever. If he could do these things, why not I? In particular, the     ',j !n' A r yi !' WaS f 1 Frances Marshall > wife of Matthew Marshall.  10 Actually, Chesterton lacks picturesque features.     A Mathematician's Apology 2037   final scene in Combination Room fascinated me completely, and from  that time, until I obtained one, mathematics meant to me primarily a  Fellowship of Trinity.   I found at once, when I came to Cambridge, that a Fellowship implied  'original work/ but it was a long time before I formed any definite idea  of research. I had of course found at school, as every future mathemati  cian does, that I could often do things much better than my teachers;  and even at Cambridge I found, though naturally much less frequently,  that I could sometimes do things better than the College lecturers. But I  was really quite ignorant, even when I took the Tripos, of the subjects  on which I have spent the rest of my life; and I still thought of mathe  matics as essentially a 'competitive' subject. My eyes were first opened by  Professor Love, who taught me for a few terms and gave me my first  serious conception of analysis. But the great debt which I owe to him  he was, after all, primarily an applied mathematician was his advice to  read Jordan's famous Cours d f analyse', and I shall never forget the aston  ishment with which I read that remarkable work, the first inspiration for  so many mathematicians of my generation, and learnt for the first time as  I read it what mathematics really meant. From that time onwards I was  in my way a real mathematician, with sound mathematical ambitions and  a genuine passion for mathematics.   I wrote a great deal during the next ten years, but very little of any  importance; there are not more than four or five papers which I can still  remember with some satisfaction. The real crises of rny career came ten  or twelve years later, in 1911, when I began my long collaboration with  Littlewood, and in 1913, when I discovered Ramanujan. All my best work  since then has been bound up with theirs, and it is obvious that my  association with them was the decisive event of my life. I still say to  myself when I am depressed, and find myself forced to listen to pompous  and tiresome people, 'Well, I have done one thing you could never have  done, and that is to have collaborated with both Littlewood and Rama  nujan on something like equal terms.' It is to them that I owe an unusually  late maturity: I was at my best at a little past forty, when I was a  professor at Oxford. Since then I have suffered from that steady deteriora  tion which is the common fate of elderly men and particularly of elderly  mathematicians. A mathematician may still be competent enough at sixty,  but it is useless to expect him to have original ideas.   It is plain now that my life, for what it is worth, is finished, and that  nothing I can do can perceptibly increase or diminish its value. It is very  difficult to be dispassionate, but I count it a 'success'; I have had more  reward and not less than was due to a man of my particular grade of  ability. I have held a series of comfortable and 'dignified' positions. I  have had very little trouble with the duller routine of universities. I hate     2038 G.H.Haray   teaching, 1 and have had to do very little, such teaching as I have done  having been almost entirely supervision of research; I love lecturing, and  have lectured a great deal to extremely able classes; and I have always  had plenty of leisure for the researches which have been the one great  permanent happiness of my life, I have found it easy to work with others,  and have collaborated on a large scale with two exceptional mathemati  cians; and this has enabled me to add to mathematics a good deal more  than I could reasonably have expected. I have had my disappointments,  like any other mathematician, but none of them has been too serious or  has made me particularly unhappy. If I had been offered a life neither  better nor worse when I was twenty, I would have accepted without  hesitation.   It seems absurd to suppose that I could have 'done better.' I have no  linguistic or artistic ability, and very little interest in experimental science.  I might have been a tolerable philosopher, but not one of a very original  kind. I think that I might have made a good lawyer; but journalism is the  only profession, outside academic life, in which I should have felt really  confident of my chances. There is no doubt that I was right to be a mathe  matician, if the criterion is to be what is commonly called success.   My choice was right, then, if what I wanted was a reasonably comfort  able and happy life. But solicitors and stockbrokers and bookmakers often  lead comfortable and happy lives, and it is very difficult to see how the  world is the richer for their existence. Is there any sense in which I can  claim that my life has been less futile than theirs? It seems to me again  that there is only one possible answer: yes, perhaps, but, if so, for one  reason only.   I have never done anything 'useful.' No discovery of mine has made, or  is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference  to the amenity of the world. I have helped to train other mathematicians,  but mathematicians of the same kind as myself, and their work has been,  so far at any rate as I have helped them to it, as useless as my own.  Judged by all practical standards, the value of my mathematical life is  nil; and outside mathematics it is trivial anyhow. I have just one chance  of escaping a verdict of completely triviality, that I may be judged to  have created something worth creating. And that I have created something  is undeniable: the question is about its value.   The case for my life, then, or for that of any one else who has been a  mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that  I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more;  and that these somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and  not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of  any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of  memorial behind them.     COMMENTARY ON   The Elusiveness of Invention     HOW is mathematics made? What kind of brain is it that can frame  the propositions and compose the systems of mathematics? How  are mathematical ideas inspired and incubated? How do the mental proc  esses of the geometer or the algebraist compare with those of the musi  cian, the poet, the painter, the chess player, the ordinary man? In  mathematical creation which are the key elements? Intuition? An exquisite  sense of space and time? The precision of a calculating machine? A power  ful memory? Formidable skill in following complex sequences? An  exceptional capacity for concentration?   Psychologists have tried to answer, but their explanations have not been  impressive. Jacques Hadamard, an accomplished French mathematician,  surveyed the subject hi his little book, The Psychology of Invention in the  Mathematical Field. It is an entertaining account but not very enlighten  ing. The celebrated phrenologist Gall said mathematical ability showed  itself in a special bump on the head, the location of which he specified.  The psychologist Souriau, we are told, maintained that invention occurs  by "pure chance," a valuable theory. It is often suggested that creative  ideas are conjured up in "mathematical dreams," but this attractive  hypothesis has not been verified. Hadamard reports that mathematicians  were asked whether "noises" or "meteorological circumstances" helped  or hindered research; all save the most single-minded are evidently dis  commoded by severe outbreaks, but the constructive effects of such factors  is admittedly doubtful. Claude Bernard, the great physiologist, said that  in order to invent "one must think aside." Hadamard says this is a pro  found insight; he also considers whether scientific invention may perhaps  be improved by standing or sitting or by taking two baths in a row.  Helmholtz and Poincare worked sitting at a table; Hadamard's practice  is to pace the room ("Legs are the wheels of thought," said Emile  Angier) ; the chemist J. Teeple was the two-bath man. Alas, the habits of  famous men are rarely profitable to their disciples. The young philosopher  will derive little benefit from being punctual like Kant, the biologist from  cultivating Darwin's dyspepsia, the playwright from eating Shaw's vege  tables.   The following essay, delivered early in this century as a lecture before  the Psychological Society in Paris, is at once the least pretentious and the  most celebrated of the attempts to describe what goes on in the mathe  matician's brain. Henri Poincare, cousin of the politician, was peculiarly  fitted to undertake the task. One of the foremost mathematicians of all   2039     2040 Editor's Comment   time, unrivaled as an analyst and mathematical physicist, he was also a  matchless expositor of the philosophy of science. Poincare's piece fails  entirely, I think, to elucidate the problem of mathematical creation, but  as an autobiographical fragment it tells a dramatic story and is one of the  treasures of science and literature. 1   1 For a biographical essay on Poincare see p. 1374.     All the inventions that the world contains,   Were not by reason first found out, nor brains;   But pass for theirs who had the luck to light   Upon them by mistake or oversight. SAMUEL BUTLER (1612-1680}     2 Mathematical Creation   By HENRI POINCARE     THE genesis of mathematical creation is a problem which should intensely  interest the psychologist. It is the activity in which the human mind seems  to take least from the outside world, in which it acts or seems to act only  of itself and on itself, so that in studying the procedure of geometric  thought we may hope to reach what is most essential in man's mind.   This has long been appreciated, and some time back the journal called  L' enseignement mathematique, edited by Laisant and Fehr, began an in  vestigation of the mental habits and methods of work of different mathe  maticians. I had finished the main outlines of this article when the results  of that inquiry were published, so I have hardly been able to utilize them  and shall confine myself to saying that the majority of witnesses confirm  my conclusions; I do not say all, for when the appeal is to universal  suffrage unanimity is not to be hoped.   A first fact should surprise us, or rather would surprise us if we were  not so used to it. How does it happen there are people who do not under  stand mathematics? If mathematics invokes only the rules of logic, such  as are accepted by all normal minds; if its evidence is based on principles  common to all men, and that none could deny without being mad, how  does it come about that so many persons are here refractory?   That not every one can invent is nowise mysterious. That not every one  can retain a demonstration once learned may also pass. But that not every  one can understand mathematical reasoning when explained appears very  surprising when we think of it. And yet those who can follow this reason  ing only with difficulty are in the majority: that is undeniable, and will  surely not be gainsaid by the experience of secondary-school teachers.   And further: how is error possible in mathematics? A sane mind should  not be guilty of a logical fallacy, and yet there are very fine minds who do  not trip in brief reasoning such as occurs in the ordinary doings of life,  and who are incapable of following or repeating without error the mathe  matical demonstrations which are longer, but which after all are only an  accumulation of brief reasonings wholly analogous to those they make so  easily. Need we add that mathematicians themselves are not infallible?   The answer seems to me evident. Imagine a long series of syllogisms,   2041     Henri foincari  2042   and that the conclusions of the first serve as premises of the following: we  shall be able to catch each of these syllogisms, and it is not in passing  from premises to conclusion that we are in danger of deceiving ourselves.  But between the moment in which we first meet a proposition as conclu  sion of one syllogism, and that in which we reencounter it as premise of  another syllogism occasionally some time will elapse, several links of the  chain will have unrolled; so it may happen that we have forgotten it, or  worse, that we have forgotten its meaning. So it may happen that we re  place it by a slightly different proposition, or that, while retaining the  same enunciation, we attribute to it a slightly different meaning, and thus  it is that we are exposed to error.   Often the mathematician uses a rule. Naturally he begins by demon  strating this rule; and at the time when this proof is fresh in his memory  he understands perfectly its meaning and its bearing, and he is in no  danger of changing it. But subsequently he trusts his memory and after  ward only applies it in a mechanical way; and then if his memory fails  him, he may apply it all wrong. Thus it is, to take a simple example, that  we sometimes make slips in calculation because we have forgotten our  multiplication table.   According to this, the special aptitude for mathematics would be due  only to a very sure memory or to a prodigious force of attention. It would  be a power like that of the whist-player who remembers the cards played;  or, to go up a step, like that of the chess-player who can visualize a great  number of combinations and hold them in his memory. Every good mathe  matician ought to be a good chess-player, and inversely; likewise he should  be a good computer. Of course that sometimes happens; thus Gauss was  at the same time a geometer of genius and a very precocious and accurate  computer.   But there are exceptions; or rather I err; I can not call them exceptions  without the exceptions being more than the rule. Gauss it is, on the con  trary, who was an exception. As for myself, I must confess, I am abso  lutely incapable even of adding without mistakes. In the same way I  should be but a poor chess-player; I would perceive that by a certain play  I should expose myself to a certain danger; I would pass in review several  other plays, rejecting them for other reasons, and then finally I should  make the move first examined, having meantime forgotten the danger I  had foreseen.   In a word, my memory is not bad, but it would be insufficient to make  me a good chess-player. Why then does it not fail me in a difficult piece  of mathematical reasoning where most chess-players would lose them  selves? Evidently because it is guided by the general march of the reason  ing. A mathematical demonstration is not a simple juxtaposition of syllo  gisms, it is syllogisms placed in a certain order, and the order in which     Mathematical Creation 2043   these elements are placed is much more important than the elements them  selves. If I have the feeling, the intuition, so to speak, of this order, so  as to perceive at a glance the reasoning as a whole, I need no longer fear  lest I forget one of the elements, for each of them will take its allotted  place in the array, and that without any effort of memory on my part.   It seems to me then, in repeating a reasoning learned, that I could have  invented it. This is often only an illusion; but even then, even if I am  not so gifted as to create it by myself, I myself re-invent it in so far as I  repeat it.   We know that this feeling, this intuition of mathematical order, that  makes us divine hidden harmonies and relations, can not be possessed  by every one. Some will not have either this delicate feeling so difficult to  define, or a strength of memory and attention beyond the ordinary, and  then they will be absolutely incapable of understanding higher mathe  matics. Such are the majority. Others will have this feeling only in a  slight degree, but they will be gifted with an uncommon memory and  a great power of attention. They will learn by heart the details one after  another; they can understand mathematics and sometimes make applica  tions, but they cannot create. Others, finally, will possess in a less or  greater degree the special intuition referred to, and then not only can  they understand mathematics even if their memory is nothing extraordi  nary, but they may become creators and try to invent with more or less  success according as this intuition is more or less developed in them.   In fact, what is mathematical creation? It does not consist in making  new combinations with mathematical entities already known. Any one  could do that, but the combinations so made Would be infinite in number  and most of them absolutely without interest. To create consists precisely  in not making useless combinations and in making those which are useful  and which are only a small minority. Invention is discernment, choice.   How to make this choice I have before explained; the mathematical  facts worthy of being studied are those which, by their analogy with other  facts, are capable of leading us to the knowledge of a mathematical law  just as experimental facts lead us to the knowledge of a physical law.  They are those which reveal to us unsuspected kinship between other  facts, long known, but wrongly believed to be strangers to one another.   Among chosen combinations the most fertile will often be those formed  of elements drawn from domains which are far apart. Not that I mean as  sufficing for invention the bringing together of objects as disparate as  possible; most combinations so formed would be entirely sterile. But  certain among them, very rare, are the most fruitful of all.   To invent, I have said, is to choose; but the word is perhaps not wholly  exact. It makes one think of a purchaser before whom are displayed a  large number of samples, and who examines them, one after the other, to     Henri Poincart  2044   make a choice. Here the samples would be so numerous that a whole life  time would not suffice to examine them. This is not the actual state of  things. The sterile combinations do not even present themselves to the  mind of the inventor. Never in the field of his consciousness do combina  tions appear that are not really useful, except some that he rejects but  which have to some extent the characteristics of useful combinations. All  goes on as if the inventor were an examiner for the second degree who  would only have to question the candidates who had passed a previous   examination.   But what I have hitherto said is what may be observed or inferred in  reading the writings of the geometers, reading reflectively.   It is time to penetrate deeper and to see what goes on in the very soul  of the mathematician. For this, I believe, I can do best by recalling  memories of my own. But I shall limit myself to telling how I wrote my  first memoir on Fuchsian functions. I beg the reader's pardon; I am about  to use some technical expressions, but they need not frighten him, for he  is not obliged to understand them. I shall say, for example, that I have  found the demonstration of such a theorem under such circumstances.  This theorem will have a barbarous name, unfamiliar to many, but that is  unimportant; what is of interest for the psychologist is not the theorem  but the circumstances.   For fifteen days I strove to prove that there could not be any functions  like those I have since called Fuchsian functions. I was then very ignorant;  every day I seated myself at my work table, stayed an hour or two, tried  a great number of combinations and reached no results. One evening, con  trary to my custom, I drank black coffee and could not sleep. Ideas rose  in crowds; I felt them collide until pairs interlocked, so to speak, making  a stable combination. By the next morning I had established the existence  of a class of Fuchsian functions, those which come from the hypergeo-  metric series; I had only to write out the results, which took but a few  hours.   Then I wanted to represent these functions by the quotient of two  series; this idea was perfectly conscious and deliberate, the analogy with  elliptic functions guided me. I asked myself what properties these series  must have if they existed, and I succeeded without difficulty in forming  the series I have called theta-Fuchsian.   Just at this time I left Caen, where I was then living, to go on a geo  logical excursion under the auspices of the school of mines. The changes  of travel made me forget my mathematical work. Having reached Cou-  tances,. we entered an omnibus to go some place or other. At the moment  when I put my foot on the step the idea came to me, without anything in  my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it, that the trans  formations I had used to define the Fuchsian functions were identical with     Mathematical Creation 2045   those of non-Euclidean geometry. I did not verify the idea; I should not  have had time, as, upon taking my seat in the omnibus, I went on with a  conversation already commenced, but I felt a perfect certainty. On my  return to Caen, for conscience' sake I verified the result at my leisure.   Then I turned my attention to the study of some arithmetic questions  apparently without much success and without a suspicion of any connec  tion with my preceding researches. Disgusted with my failure, I went to  spend a few days at the seaside, and thought of something else. One morn  ing, walking on the bluff, the idea came to me, with just the same char  acteristics of brevity, suddenness and immediate certainty, that the arith  metic transformations of indeterminate ternary quadratic forms were  identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry.   Returned to Caen, I meditated on this result and deduced the conse  quences. The example of quadratic forms showed me that there were  Fuchsian groups other than those corresponding to the hypergeometric  series; I saw that I could apply to them the theory of theta-Fuchsian series  and that consequently there existed Fuchsian functions other than those  from the hypergeometric series, the ones I then knew. Naturally I set  myself to form all these functions. I made a systematic attack upon them  and carried all the outworks, one after another. There was one however  that still held out, whose fall would involve that of the whole place. But  all my efforts only served at first the better to show me the difficulty,  which indeed was something. All this work was perfectly conscious.   Thereupon I left for Mont-Valerien, where I was to go through my  military service; so I was very differently occupied. One day, going along  the street, the solution of the difficulty which had stopped me suddenly  appeared to me. I did not try to go deep into it immediately, and only  after my service did I again take up the question. I had all the elements  and had only to arrange them and put them together. So I wrote out my  final memoir at a single stroke and without difficulty.   I shall limit myself to this single example; it is useless to multiply them.  In regard to my other researches I would have to say analogous things,  and the observations of other mathematicians given in U enseignement  mathematique would only confirm them.   Most striking at first is this appearance of sudden illumination, a mani  fest sign of long, unconscious prior work. The role of this unconscious  work in mathematical invention appears to me incontestable, and traces of  it would be found in other cases where it is less evident. Often when one  'wofks at a hard question, nothing good is accomplished at the first attack.  Then one takes a rest, longer or shorter, and sits down anew to the work.  During the first half-hour, as before, nothing is found, and then all of a  sudden the decisive idea presents itself to the mind. It might be said that  the conscious work has been more fruitful because it has been interrupted     2046 Henri Poincarg   and the rest has given back to the mind its force and freshness. But it is  more probable that this rest has been filled out with unconscious work and  that the result of this work has afterwards revealed itself to the geometer  just as in the cases I have cited; only the revelation, instead of coming  during a walk or a journey, has happened during a period of conscious  work, but independently of this work which plays at most a role of ex  citant, as if it were the goad stimulating the results already reached during  rest, but remaining unconscious, to assume the conscious form.   There is another remark to be made about the conditions of this un  conscious work; it is possible, and of a certainty it is only fruitful, if it  is on the one hand preceded and on the other hand followed by a period  of conscious work. These sudden inspirations (and the examples already  cited sufficiently prove this) never happen except after some days of  voluntary effort which has appeared absolutely fruitless and whence  nothing good seems to have come, where the way taken seems totally  astray. These efforts then have not been as sterile as one thinks; they have  set agoing the unconscious machine and without them it would not have  moved and would have produced nothing.   ^The need for the second period of conscious work, after i.he inspiration,  is still easier to understand. It is necessary to put in shape the results of  this inspiration, to deduce from them the immediate consequences, to  arrange them, to word the demonstrations, but above all is verification  necessary. I have spoken of the feeling of absolute certitude accompany  ing the inspiration; in the cases cited this feeling was no deceiver, nor is  it usually. But do not think this a rule without exception; often this feeling  deceives us without being any the less vivid, and we only find it out when  we seek to put on foot the demonstration. I have especially noticed this  fact in regard to ideas coming to me in the morning or evening in bed  while in a semi-hypnagogic state.   Such are the realities; now for the thoughts they force upon us. The un  conscious, or, as we say, the subliminal self plays an important role in  mathematical creation; this follows from what we have said. But usually  the subliminal self is considered as purely automatic. Now we have seen  that mathematical work is not simply mechanical, that it could not be  done by a machine, however perfect. It is not merely a question of apply  ing rules, of making the most combinations possible according to certain  fixed laws. The combinations so obtained would be exceedingly numerous,  useless and cumbersome. The true work of the inventor consists in  choosing among these combinations so as to eliminate the useless ones or  rather to avoid the trouble of making them, and the rules which must  guide this choice are extremely fine and delicate. It is almost impossible  to state them precisely; they are felt rather than formulated. Under these  conditions, how imagine a sieve capable of applying them mechanically?     Mathematical Creation 2047   A first hypothesis now presents itself: the subliminal self is in no way  inferior to the conscious self; it is not purely automatic; it is capable of  discernment; it has tact, delicacy; it knows how to choose, to divine. What  do I say? It knows better how to divine than the conscious self, since it  succeeds where that has failed. In a word, is not the subliminal self  superior to the conscious self? You recognize the full importance of this  question. Boutroux in a recent lecture has shown how it came up on a  very different occasion, and what consequences would follow an affir  mative answer. (See also, by the same author, Science et Religion,  pp. 313 ff.)   Is this affirmative answer forced upon us by the facts I have just given?  I confess that, for my part, I should hate to accept it. Reexamine the facts  then and see if they are not compatible with another explanation.   It is certain that the combinations which present themselves to the mind  in a sort of sudden illumination, after an unconscious working somewhat  prolonged, are generally useful and fertile combinations, which seem the  result of a first impression. Does it follow that the subliminal self, having  divined by a delicate intuition that these combinations would be useful,  has formed only these, or has it rather formed many others which were  lacking in interest and have remained unconscious?   In his second way of looking at it, all the combinations would be  formed in consequence of the automatism of the subliminal self, but only  the interesting ones would break into the domain of consciousness. And  this is still very mysterious. What is the cause that, among the thousand  products of our unconscious activity, some are called to pass the threshold,  while others remain below? Is it a simple chance which confers this privi  lege? Evidently not; among all the stimuli of our senses, for example,  only the most intense fix our 'attention, unless it has been drawn to them  by other causes. More generally the privileged unconscious phenomena,  those susceptible of becoming conscious, are those which, directly or in  directly affect most profoundly our emotional sensibility.   It may be surprising to see emotional sensibility invoked a propos of  mathematical demonstrations which, it would seem, can interest only the  intellect. This would be to forget the feeling of mathematical beauty, of  the harmony of numbers and forms, of geometric elegance. This is a true  esthetic feeling that all real mathematicians know, and surely it belongs to  emotional sensibility.   Now, what are the mathematic entities to which we attribute this char  acter of beauty and elegance, and which are capable of developing in us  a sort of esthetic emotion? They are those whose elements are harmoni  ously disposed so that the mind without effort can embrace their totality  while realizing the details. This harmony 'is at once a satisfaction of our  esthetic needs and an aid to the mind, sustaining and guiding. And at the     Henri Poincare     same time, in putting under our eyes a well-ordered whole, it makes us  foresee a mathematical law. Now, as we have said above, the only mathe  matical facts worthy of fixing our attention and capable of being useful  are those which can teach us a mathematical law. So that we reach the  following conclusion: The useful combinations are precisely the most  beautiful, I mean those best able to charm this special sensibility that all  mathematicians know, but of which the profane are so ignorant as often  to be tempted to smile at it   What happens then? Among the great numbers of combinations blindly  formed by the subliminal self, almost all are without interest and without  utility; but just for that reason they are also without effect upon the  esthetic sensibility. Consciousness will never know them; only certain ones  are harmonious, and, consequently, at once useful and beautiful. They  will be capable of touching his special sensibility of the geometer of which  I have just spoken, and which, once aroused, will call our attention to  them, and thus give them occasion to become conscious.   This is only a hypothesis, and yet here is an observation which may  confirm it: when a sudden illumination seizes upon the mind of the mathe  matician, it usually happens that it does not deceive him, but it also some  times happens, as I have said, that it does not stand the test of verification;  well, we almost always notice that this false idea, had it been true, would  have gratified our natural feeling for mathematical elegance.   Thus it is this special esthetic sensibility which plays the role of the  delicate sieve of which I spoke, and that sufficiently explains why the one  lacking it will never be a real creator,   Yet all the difficulties have not disappeared. The conscious self is nar  rowly limited, and as for the subliminal self we know not its limitations,  and this is why we are not too reluctant in supposing that it has been able  in a short time to make more different combinations than the whole life  of a conscious being could encompass. Yet these limitations exist. Is it  likely that it is able to form all the possible combinations, whose number  would frighten the imagination? Nevertheless that would seem necessary,  because if it produces only a small part of these combinations, and if it  makes them at random, there would be small chance that the good, the  one we should choose, would be found among them.   Perhaps we ought to seek the explanation in that preliminary period of  conscious work which always precedes all fruitful unconscious labor. Per  mit me a rough comparison. Figure the future elements of our combina  tions as something like the hooked atoms of Epicurus. During the com  plete repose of the mind, these atoms are motionless, they are, so to speak,  hooked to the wall; so this complete rest may be indefinitely prolonged  without the atoms meeting, and consequently without any combination  between them,     Mathematical Creation 2049   On the other hand, during a period of apparent rest and unconscious  work, certain of them are detached from the wall and put in motion.  They flash in every direction through the space (I was about to say the  room) where they are enclosed, as would, for example, a swarm of gnats  or, if you prefer a more learned comparison, like the molecules- of gas  in the kinematic theory of gases. Then their mutual impacts may produce  new combinations.   What is the role of the preliminary conscious work? It is evidently to  mobilize certain of these atoms, to unhook them from the wall and put  them in swing. We think we have done no good, because we have moved  these elements a thousand different ways in seeking to assemble them, and  have found no satisfactory aggregate. But, after this shaking up imposed  upon them by our will, these atoms do not return to their primitive rest.  They freely continue their dance.   Now, our will did not choose them at random; it pursued a perfectly  determined aim. The mobilized atoms are therefore not any atoms whatso  ever; they are those from which we might reasonably expect the desired  solution. Then the mobilized atoms undergo impacts which make them  enter into combinations among themselves or with other atoms at rest  which they struck against in their course. Again I beg pardon, my com  parison is very rough, but I scarcely know how otherwise to make my  thought understood.   However it may be, the only combinations that have a chance of form  ing are those where at least one of the elements is one of those atoms  freely chosen by our will. Now, it is evidently among these that is found  what I called the good combination. Perhaps this is a way of lessening the  paradoxical in the original hypothesis.   Another observation. It never happens that the unconscious work gives  us the result of a somewhat long calculation all made, where we have only  to apply fixed rules. We might think the wholly automatic subliminal self  particularly apt for this sort of work, which is in a way exclusively  mechanical. It seems that thinking in the evening upon the factors of a  multiplication we might hope to find the product ready made upon our  awakening, or again that an algebraic calculation, for example a verifica  tion, would be made unconsciously. Nothing of the sort, as observation  proves. All one may hope from these inspirations, fruits of unconscious  work, is a point of departure for such calculations. As for the calculations  themselves, they must be made in the second period of conscious work,  that which follows the inspiration, that in which one verifies the results  of this inspiration and deduces their consequences. The rules of these  calculations are strict and complicated. They require discipline, attention,  will, and therefore consciousness. In the subliminal self, on the contrary,  reigns what I should call liberty, if we might give this name to the simple     2050 Henri Poincart   absence of discipline and to the disorder born of chance. Only, this dis  order itself permits unexpected combinations.   I shall make a last remark: when above I made certain personal obser  vations, I spoke of a night of excitement when I worked in spite of my  self. Such cases are frequent, and it is not necessary that the abnormal  cerebral activity be caused by a physical excitant as in that I mentioned.  It seems, in such cases, that one is present at his own unconscious work,  made partially perceptible to the over-excited consciousness, yet without  having changed its nature. Then we vaguely comprehend what distin  guishes the two mechanisms or, if you wish, the working methods of the  two egos. And the psychologic observations I have been able thus to make  seem to me to confirm in their general outlines the views I have given.   Surely they have need of it, for they are and remain in spite of all very  hypothetical: the interest of the questions is so great that I do not repent  of having submitted them to the reader.     COMMENTARY ON   The Use of a Top Hat  as a Water Bucket     THE ideas of mathematics originate in experience. I doubt that this  truth is widely recognized or that mathematicians are always prepared  to acknowledge the indebtedness it implies. Schoolboys are taught that  geometry started as an empirical science, as a set of rules devised for land  measurement in Egypt, and it is generally taken for granted though it  may not be strictly true that we use a decimal system because we have  ten fingers. In more advanced mathematics the relation of ideas to experi  ence is less obvious. Leaving aside the unworthy suspicions of the student  who thinks that algebra and the calculus were devised for the express  purpose of grinding him down, it is patently less easy to explain where  these disciplines came from than to explain the origins of arithmetic. Yet  the historian of mathematics has no trouble demonstrating that the cal  culus began as a method for measuring areas and volumes bounded by  curves and curved surfaces (Kepler's first attempts at integration, for ex  ample, arose in connection with the measurement of kegs); that algebra  had "strong empirical ties." In general a close link can be shown between  the development of mathematics and the natural sciences.   To be sure, it is not always possible to give a simple and convincing  proof that mathematics is rooted in experience. Some important branches  of the science are so terrifyingly abstract and inhuman as to satisfy even  the purest of pure mathematicians. The study of Hilbert spaces has noth  ing to do with space though it has to do with a mathematician named  Hilbert; J. J. Sylvester's interesting paper "On the Problem of the Virgins,  and the General Theory of Compound Partition" is in no wise connected  with virgins or partitions. It is amazing what ingenious men can cook up  from the simplest ingredients.   It may seem plausible that certain areas of mathematics should be  wholly divorced from empirics and live, so to speak, lives of their own,  but I think one cannot escape the conclusion that all its branches derive  ultimately from sources within human experience. Any other view must  fall back in the end on an appeal to mysticism. Furthermore, when the  most abstract and "useless" disciplines have been cultivated for a time,  they are often seized upon as practical tools by other departments of  science. I conceive that this is no accident, as if one bought a top hat for  a wedding and discovered later, when a fire broke out, that it could be  used as a water bucket. Von Neumann gives the examples of differential   2051     2052 Editor's Comment   geometry and group theory, devised as intellectual games, and still mainly  pursued in the "nonapplied" spirit. "After a decade in one case, and a  century in the other, they turned out to be very useful in physics." There  are mathematicians who regard such harnessing of their beloved disci  plines as a defilement; at best, they consider usefulness in the empirical  sciences to be immaterial. There is no need to quarrel with this point of  view. What is important is that mathematical activities abstractly con  ceived so often take a hand in the practical work of the world. This sug  gests, if indeed it does not prove, a profound connection.   These matters are thoughtfully considered in the essay below. John von  Neumann is one of the foremost mathematicians of our time. He has  never failed to enlarge our understanding of any problem, however com  plex, to which he has turned his attention. His observations both enlighten  and stimulate. In this essay he makes the exciting suggestion that the  criteria of mathematical success are "almost entirely aesthetical." This is  far from the notion that mathematics is a science of necessary and eternal  truths. Mathematics as a matter of taste is a conception which will appeal  to many, not least to those who have no taste for the subject in its more  rigorous form.   * * *   I add a biographical note about Von Neumann. He was born in Buda  pest, Hungary, in 1903, and received his training at the University of Ber  lin, the Zurich Polytechnical Institute and the University of Budapest. For  a time he taught in Berlin, and from 1930 to 1933 was professor of mathe  matical physics at Princeton. In the latter year he became a professor at  the Institute for Advanced Study. His work in several branches of mathe  matics has been of the first order: mathematical logic, set theory, theory  of continuous groups, ergodic theory, quantum theory, operator theory  and high-speed computing devices. For his inestimable services during the  war and after as a consultant to the Army and the Navy and the Atomic  Energy Commission he was awarded the Medal of Merit, the Distinguished  Civilian Service award, and the Fermi award. He is a member of the  National Academy of Sciences, and in 1954 was appointed to member  ship in the Atomic Energy Commission.     For he, by geometric scale,   Could take the size of pots of ale; , . .   And wisely tell what hour o' th* day   The clock doth strike, by algebra. SAMUEL BUTLER (Hudibras)     3 The Mathematician   By JOHN VON NEUMANN     A DISCUSSION of the nature of intellectual work is a difficult task in any  field, even in fields which are not so far removed from the central area of  our common human intellectual effort as mathematics still is. A discussion  of the nature of any intellectual effort is difficult per se at any rate, more  difficult than the mere exercise of that particular intellectual effort. It is  harder to understand the mechanism of an airplane, and the theories of  the forces which lift and which propel it, than merely to ride in it, to be  elevated and transported by it or even to steer it. It is exceptional that  one should be able to acquire the understanding of a process without  having previously acquired a deep familiarity with running it, with using  it, before one has assimilated it in an instinctive and empirical way.   Thus any discussion of the nature of intellectual effort in any field is  difficult, unless it presupposes an easy, routine familiarity with that field.  In mathematics this limitation becomes very severe, if the discussion is to  be kept on a nonmathematical plane. The discussion will then necessarily  show some very bad features; points which are made can never be prop  erly documented; and a certain over-all superficiality of the discussion  becomes unavoidable.   I am very much aware of these shortcomings in what I am going to say,  and I apologize in advance. Besides, the views which I am going to express  are probably not wholly shared by many other mathematicians you will  get one man's not-too-well systematized impressions and interpretations  and I can give you only very little help in deciding how much they are  to the point.   In spite of all these hedges, however, I must admit that it is an interest  ing and challenging task to make the attempt and to talk to you about  the nature of intellectual effort in mathematics. I only hope that I will not  fail too badly.   The most vitally characteristic fact about mathematics is, in my opinion,  its quite peculiar relationship to the natural sciences, or, more generally,  to any science which interprets experience on a higher than purely de  scriptive level.   2053     John von Neumann   Most people, mathematicians and others, will agree that mathematics  is not an empirical science, or at least that it is practiced in a manner  which differs in several decisive respects from the techniques of the em  pirical sciences. And, yet, its development is very closely linked with the  natural sciences. One of its main branches, geometry, actually started as a  natural, empirical science. Some of the best inspirations of modern mathe  matics (I believe, the best ones) clearly originated in the natural sciences.  The methods of mathematics pervade and dominate the "theoretical" divi  sions of the natural sciences. In modern empirical sciences it has become  more and more a major criterion of success whether they have become  accessible to the mathematical method or to the near-mathematical meth  ods of physics. Indeed, throughout the natural sciences an unbroken chain  of successive pseudomorphoses, all of them pressing toward mathematics,  and almost identified with the idea of scientific progress, has become more  and more evident. Biology becomes increasingly pervaded by chemistry  and physics, chemistry by experimental and theoretical physics, and  physics by very mathematical forms of theoretical physics.   There is a quite peculiar duplicity in the nature of mathematics. One  has to realize this duplicity, to accept it, and to assimilate it into one's  thinking on the subject. This double face is the face of mathematics, and  I do not believe that any simplified, Unitarian view of the thing is possible  without sacrificing the essence.   I will therefore not attempt to present you with a Unitarian version. I  will attempt to describe, as best I can, the multiple phenomenon which is  mathematics.   It is undeniable that some of the best inspirations in mathematics in  those parts of it which are as pure mathematics as one can imagine have  come from the natural sciences. We will mention the two most monu  mental facts.   The first example is, as it should be, geometry. Geometry was the major  part of ancient mathematics. It is, with several of its ramifications, still  one of the main divisions of modern mathematics. There can be no doubt  that its origin in antiquity was empirical and that it began as a discipline  not unlike theoretical physics today. Apart from all other evidence, the  very name "geometry" indicates this. Euclid's postulational treatment  represents a great step away from empiricism, but it is not at all simple  to defend the position that this was the decisive and final step, producing  an absolute separation. That Euclid's axiomatization does at some minor  points not meet the modern requirements of absolute axiomatic rigor is of  lesser importance in this respect. What is more essential, is this: other dis  ciplines, which are undoubtedly empirical, like mechanics and thermo  dynamics, are usually presented in a more or less postulational treatment,     The Mathematician 2055   which in the presentation of some authors is hardly distinguishable from  Euclid's procedure. The classic of theoretical physics in our time, New  ton's Principia, was, in literary form as well as in the essence of some of  its most critical parts, very much like Euclid. Of course in all these in  stances there is behind the postulational presentation the physical insight  backing the postulates and the experimental verification supporting the  theorems. But one might well argue that a similar interpretation of Euclid  is possible, especially from the viewpoint of antiquity, before geometry  had acquired its present bimillennial stability and authority an authority  which the modern edifice of theoretical physics is clearly lacking.   Furthermore, while the de-empirization of geometry has gradually pro  gressed since Euclid, it never became' quite complete, not even in modern  times. The discussion of non-Euclidean geometry offers a good illustration  of this. It also offers an illustration of the ambivalence of mathematical  thought. Since most of the discussion took place on a highly abstract  plane, it dealt with the purely logical problem whether the "fifth postulate"  of Euclid was a consequence of the others or not; and the formal conflict  was terminated by K Klein's purely mathematical example, which showed  how a piece of a Euclidean plane could be made non-Euclidean by  formally redefining certain basic concepts. And yet the empirical stimulus  was there from start to finish. The prime reason, why, of all Euclid's  postulates, the fifth was questioned, was clearly the unempirical character  of the concept of the entire infinite plane which intervenes there, and  there only. The idea that in at least one significant sense and in spite of  all mathematico-logical analyses the decision for or against Euclid may  have to be empirical, was certainly present in the mind of the greatest  mathematician, Gauss. And after Bolyai, Lobatschefski, Riemann, and  Klein had obtained more abstracto, what we today consider the formal  resolution of the original controversy, empirics or rather physics never  theless, had the final say. The discovery of general relativity forced a re  vision of our views on the relationship of geometry in an entirely new  setting and with a quite new distribution of the purely mathematical em  phases, too. Finally, one more touch to complete the picture of contrast.  This last development took place in the same generation which saw the  complete de-empirization and abstraction of Euclid's axiomatic method in  the hands of the modern axiomatic-logical mathematicians. And these two  seemingly conflicting attitudes are perfectly compatible in one mathemati  cal mind; thus Hilbert made important contributions to both axiomatic  geometry and to general relativity.   The second example is calculus or rather all of analysis, which sprang  from it. The calculus was the first achievement of modern mathematics,  and it is difficult to overestimate its importance. I think it defines more  unequivocally than anything else the inception of modern mathematics,     John von Neumann  2056   and the system of mathematical analysis, which is its logical development,  still contitutes the greatest technical advance in exact thinking.   The origins of calculus are clearly empirical. Kepler's first attempts at  integration were formulated as "dolichometry" measurement of kegs  that is, volumetry for bodies with curved surfaces. This is geometry, but  post-Euclidean, and, at the epoch in question, nonaxiomatic, empirical  geometry. Of this, Kepler was fully aware. The main effort and the main  discoveries, those of Newton and Leibnitz, were of an explicitly physical  origin. Newton invented the calculus "of fluxions" essentially for the pur  poses of mechanics in fact, the two disciplines, calculus and mechanics,  were developed by him more or less together. The first formulations of the  calculus were not even mathematically rigorous. An inexact, semiphysical  formulation was the only one available for over a hundred and fifty years  after Newton! And yet, some of the most important advances of analysis  took place during this period, against this inexact, mathematically inade  quate background! Some of the leading mathematical spirits of the period  were clearly not rigorous, like Euler; but others, in the main, were, like  Gauss or Jacobi. The development was as confused and ambiguous as can  be, and its relation to empiricism was certainly not according to our  present (or Euclid's) ideas of abstraction and rigor. Yet no mathematician  would want to exclude it from the fold that period produced mathe  matics as first class as ever existed! And even after the reign of rigor was  essentially re-established with Cauchy, a very peculiar relapse into semi-  physical methods took place with Riemann. Riemann's scientific per  sonality itself is a most illuminating example of the double nature of  mathematics, as is the controversy of Riemann and Weierstrass^ but it  would take me too far into technical matters if I went into specific details.  Since Weierstrass, analysis seems to have become completely abstract,  rigorous, and unempirical, But even this is not unqualifiedly true. The con  troversy about the "foundations" of mathematics and logics, which took  place during the last two generations, dispelled many illusions on this  score.   This brings me to the third example which is relevant for the diagnosis.  This example, however, deals with the relationship of mathematics with  philosophy or epistemology rather than with the natural sciences. It illus  trates in a very striking fashion that the very concept of "absolute" mathe  matical rigor is not immutable. The variability of the concept of rigor  shows that something else besides mathematical abstraction must enter  into the makeup of mathematics. In analyzing the controversy about the  "foundations," I have not been able to convince myself that the verdict  must be in favor of the empirical nature of this extra component. The  case in favor of such an interpretation is quite strong, at least in some  phases of the discussion. But I do not consider it absolutely cogent. Two     The Mathematician 2057   things, however, are clear. First, that something nonmathematical, some  how connected with the empirical sciences or with philosophy or both,  does enter essentially and its nonempirical character could only be main  tained if one assumed that philosophy (or more specifically epistemology)  can exist independently of experience. (And this assumption is only neces  sary but not in itself sufficient.) Second, that the empirical origin of  mathematics is strongly supported by instances like our two earlier ex  amples (geometry and calculus), irrespective of what the best interpreta  tion of the controversy about the "foundations" may be.   In analyzing the variability of the concept of mathematical rigor, I wish  to lay the main stress on the "foundations" controversy, as mentioned  above. I would, however, like to consider first briefly a secondary aspect  of the matter. This aspect also strengthens my argument, but I do consider  it as secondary, because it is probably less conclusive than the analysis of  the "foundations" controversy. I am referring to the changes of mathe  matical "style." It is well known that the style in which mathematical  proofs are written has undergone considerable fluctuations. It is better to  talk of fluctuations than of a trend because in some respects the difference  between the present and certain authors of the eighteenth or of the nine  teenth centuries is greater than between the present and Euclid. On the  other hand, in other respects there has been remarkable constancy. In  fields in which differences are present, they are mainly differences in pres-.  entation, which can be eliminated without bringing in any new ideas. How  ever, in many cases these differences are so wide that one begins to doubt  whether authors who "present their cases" in such divergent ways can  have been separated by differences in style, taste, and education only  whether they can really have had the same ideas as to what constitutes  mathematical rigor. Finally, in the extreme cases (e.g., in much of the  work of the late-eighteenth-century analysis, referred to above), the dif  ferences are essential and can be remedied, if at all, only with the help of  new and profound theories, which it took up to a hundred years to de  velop. Some of the mathematicians who worked in such, to us, unrigorous  ways (or some of their contemporaries, who criticized them) were well  aware of their lack of rigor. Or to be more objective: Their own desires  as to what mathematical procedure should be were more in conformity  with our present views than their actions. But others the greatest virtuoso  of the period, for example, Euler seem to have acted in perfect good  faith and to have been quite satisfied with their own standards.   However, I do not want to press this matter further. I will turn instead  to a perfectly clear-cut case, the controversy about the "foundations of  mathematics." In the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries a  new branch of abstract mathematics, G. Cantor's theory of sets, led into  difficulties. That is, certain reasonings led to contradictions; and, while     2058 John von Neumann   these reasonings were not in the central and "useful" part of set theory,  and always easy to spot by certain formal criteria, it was nevertheless not  clear why they should be deemed less set-theoretical than the "successful* 5  parts of the theory. Aside from the ex post insight that they actually led  into disaster, it was not clear what a priori motivation, what consistent  philosophy of the situation, would permit one to segregate them from  those parts of set theory which one wanted to save. A closer study of the  merita of the case, undertaken mainly by Russell and Weyl, and concluded  by Brouwer, showed that the way in which not only set theory but also  most of modern mathematics used the concepts of "general validity" and  of "existence" was philosophically objectionable. A system of mathematics  which was free of these undesirable traits, "intuitionism," was developed  by Brouwer. In this system the difficulties and contradiction of set theory  did not arise. However, a good fifty per cent of modern mathematics, in  its most vital and up to then unquestioned parts, especially in analysis,  were also affected by this "purge": they either became invalid or had to  be justified by very complicated subsidiary considerations. And in this  latter process one usually lost appreciably in generality of validity and ele  gance of deduction. Nevertheless, Brouwer and Weyl considered it neces  sary that the concept of mathematical rigor be revised according to these  ideas.   It is difficult to overestimate the significance of these events. In the third  decade of the twentieth century two mathematicians both of them of the  first magnitude, and as deeply and fully conscious of what mathematics is,  or is for, or is about, as anybody could be actually proposed that the  concept of mathematical rigor, of what constitutes an exact proof, should  be changed! The developments which followed are equally worth  noting.   1. Only very few mathematicians were willing to accept the new,  exigent standards for their own daily use, Very many, however, admitted  that Weyl and Brouwer were prima facie right, but they themselves con  tinued to trespass, that is, to do their own mathematics in the old, "easy"  fashion probably in the hope that somebody else, at some other time,  might find the answer to the intuitionistic critique and thereby justify  them a posteriori.   2. Hilbert came forward with the following ingenious idea to justify  "classical" (i.e., pre-intuitionistic) mathematics: Even in the intuitionistic  system it is possible to give a rigorous account of how classical mathe  matics operate, that is, one can describe how the classical system works,  although one cannot justify its workings. It might therefore be possible to  demonstrate intuitionistically that classical procedures can never lead into  contradictions into conflicts with each other. It was clear that such a  proof would be very difficult, but there were certain indications how it     The Mathematician 2059   might be attempted. Had this scheme worked, it would have provided a  most remarkable justification of classical mathematics on the basis of the  opposing intuitionistic system itself! At least, this interpretation would  have been legitimate in a system of the philosophy of mathematics which  most mathematicians were willing to accept.   3. After about a decade of attempts to carry out this program, Godel  produced a most remarkable result. This result cannot be stated absolutely  precisely without several clauses and caveats which are too technical to be  formulated here. Its essential import, however, was this: If a system of  mathematics does not lead into contradiction, then this fact cannot be  demonstrated with the procedures of that system. Godel's proof satisfied  the strictest criterion of mathematical rigor the intuitionistic one. Its  influence on Hilbert's program is somewhat controversial, for reasons  which again are too technical for this occasion. My personal opinion,  which is shared by many others, is, that Godel has shown that Hilbert's  program is essentially hopeless.   4. The main hope of a justification of classical mathematics in the  sense of Hilbert or of Brouwer and Weyl being gone, most mathemati  cians decided to use that system anyway, After all, classical mathematics  was producing results which were both elegant and useful, and, even  though one could never again be absolutely certain of its reliability, it  stood on at least as sound a foundation as, for example, the existence of  the electron. Hence, if one was willing to accept the sciences, one might  as well accept the classical system of mathematics. Such views turned out  to be acceptable even to some of the original protagonists of the intuition  istic system. At present the controversy about the "foundations" is cer  tainly not closed,, but it seems most unlikely that the classical system  should be abandoned by any but a small minority.   I have told the story of this controversy in such detail, because I think  that it constitutes the best caution against taking the immovable rigor of  mathematics too much for granted. This happened in our own lifetime,  and I know myself how humiliatingly easily my own views regarding the  absolute mathematical truth changed during this episode, and how they  changed three times in succession!   I hope that the above three examples illustrate one-half of my thesis  sufficiently well that much of the best mathematical inspiration comes  from experience and that it is hardly possible to believe in the existence  of an absolute, immutable concept of mathematical rigor, dissociated from  all human experience. I am trying to take a very low-brow attitude on this  matter. Whatever philosophical or epistemological preferences anyone may  have in this respect, the mathematical fraternities' actual experiences with  its subject give little support to the assumption of the existence of an     John von Neumann   a priori concept of mathematical rigor. However, my thesis also has a  second half, and I am going to turn to this part now.   It is very hard for any mathematician to believe that mathematics is a  purely empirical science or that all mathematical ideas originate in empiri  cal subjects. Let me consider the second half of the statement first. There  are various important parts of modern mathematics in which the empirical  origin is untraceable, or, if traceable, so remote that it is clear that the  subject has undergone a complete metamorphosis since it was cut off from  its empirical roots. The symbolism of algebra was invented for domestic,  mathematical use, but it may be reasonably asserted that it had strong  empirical ties. However, modern, "abstract" algebra has more and more  developed into directions which have even fewer empirical connections.  The same may be said about topology. And in all these fields the mathe  matician's subjective criterion of success, of the worth-whileness of his  effort, is very much self-contained and aesthetical and free (or nearly  free) of empirical connections. (I will say more about this further on.) In  set theory this is still clearer. The "power" and the "ordering" of an infi  nite set may be the generalizations of finite numerical concepts, but in  their infinite form (especially "power") they have hardly any relation to  this world. If I did not wish to avoid technicalities, I could document this  with numerous set theoretical examples the problem of the "axiom of  choice," the "comparability" of infinite "powers," the "continuum prob  lem," etc. The same remarks apply to much of real function theory and  real point-set theory. Two strange examples are given by differential geom  etry and by group theory: they were certainly conceived as abstract, non-  applied disciplines and almost always cultivated in this spirit. After a  decade in one case, and a century in the other, they turned out to be very  useful in physics. And they are still mostly pursued in the indicated, ab  stract, nonapplied spirit.   The examples for all these conditions and their various combinations  could be multiplied, but I prefer to turn instead to the first point I indi  cated above: Is mathematics an empirical science? Or, more precisely; Is  mathematics actually practiced in the way in which an empirical science is  practiced? Or, more generally: What is the mathematician's normal re  lationship to his subject? What are his criteria of success, of desirability?  What influences, what considerations, control and direct his effort?   Let us see, then, in what respects the way in which the mathematician  normally works differs from the mode of work in the natural sciences.  The difference between these, on one hand, and mathematics, on the  other, goes on, clearly increasing as one passes from the theoretical disci  plines to the experimental ones and then from the experimental disciplines  to the descriptive ones. Let us therefore compare mathematics with the  category which lies closest to it the theoretical disciplines. And let us     The Mathematician 2061   pick there the one which lies closest to mathematics. I hope that you will  not judge me too harshly if I fail to control the mathematical hybris and  add: because it is most highly developed among all theoretical sciences  that is, theoretical physics. Mathematics and theoretical physics have actu  ally a good deal in common. As I have pointed out before, Euclid's system  of geometry was the prototype of the axiomatic presentation of classical  mechanics, and similar treatments dominate phenomenological thermo  dynamics as well as certain phases of Maxwell's system of electrodynamics  and also of special relativity. Furthermore, the attitude that theoretical  physics does not explain phenomena, but only classifies and correlates, is  today accepted by most theoretical physicists. This means that the criterion  of success for such a theory is simply whether it can, by a simple and  elegant classifying and correlating scheme, cover very many phenomena,  which without this scheme would seem complicated and heterogeneous,  and whether the scheme even covers phenomena which were not consid  ered or even not known at the time when the scheme was evolved.  (These two latter statements express, of course, the unifying and the pre  dicting power of a theory.) Now this criterion, as set forth here, is clearly  to a great extent of an aesthetical nature. For this reason it is very closely  akin to the mathematical criteria of success, which, as you shall see, are  almost entirely aesthetical. Thus we are now comparing mathematics with  the empirical science that lies closest to it and with which it has, as I  hope I have shown, much in common with theoretical physics. The dif  ferences in the actual modus procedendi are nevertheless great and basic.  The aims of theoretical physics are in the main given from the "outside,"  in most cases by the needs of experimental physics. They almost always  originate in the need of resolving a difficulty; the predictive and unifying  achievements usually come afterward. If we may be permitted a simile,  the advances (predictions and unifications) come during the pursuit,  which is necessarily preceded by a battle against some pre-existing diffi  culty (usually an apparent contradiction within the existing system). Part  of the theoretical physicist's work is a search for such obstructions, which  promise a possibility for a "break-through." As I mentioned, these diffi  culties originate usually in experimentation, but sometimes they are con  tradictions between various parts of the accepted body of theory itself.  Examples are, of course, numerous.   Michelson's experiment leading to special relativity, the difficulties of  certain ionization potentials and of certain spectroscopic structures lead  ing to quantum mechanics exemplify the first case; the conflict between  special relativity and Newtonian gravitational theory leading to general  relativity exemplifies the second, rarer, case. At any rate, the problems of  theoretical physics are objectively given; and, while the criteria which  govern the exploitation of a success are, as I indicated earlier, mainly     John von Neumann     aesthetical, yet the portion of the problem, and that which I called above  the original "break-through," are hard, objective facts. Accordingly, the  subject of theoretical physics was at almost all times enormously concen  trated; at almost all times most of the effort of all theoretical physicists  was concentrated on no more than one or two very sharply circumscribed  fields quantum theory in the 1920's and early 1930's and elementary  particles and structure of nuclei since the mid-1930's are examples.   The situation in mathematics is entirely different. Mathematics falls into   a great number of subdivisions, differing from one another widely in char   acter, style, aims, and influence. It shows the very opposite of the extreme   concentration of theoretical physics. A good theoretical physicist may to   day still have a working knowledge of more than half of his subject. I   doubt that any mathematician now living has much of a relationship to   more than a quarter. "Objectively" given, "important" problems may arise   after a subdivision of mathematics has evolved relatively far and if it has   bogged down seriously before a difficulty. But even then the mathema   tician is essentially free to take it or leave it and turn to something else,   while an "important" problem in theoretical physics is usually a conflict,   a contradiction, which "must" be resolved. The mathematician has a wide   variety of fields to which he may turn, and he enjoys a very considerable   freedom in what he does with them. To come to the decisive point: I think   that it is correct to say that his criteria of selection, and also those of   success, are mainly aesthetical. I realize that this assertion is controversial   and that it is impossible to "prove" it, or indeed to go very far in sub   stantiating it, without analyzing numerous specific, technical instances.   This would again require a highly technical type of discussion, for which   this is not the proper occasion. Suffice it to say that the aesthetical char   acter is even more prominent than in the instance I mentioned above in   the case of theoretical physics. One expects a mathematical theorem or a   mathematical theory not only to describe and to classify in a simple and   elegant way numerous and a priori disparate special cases. One also ex   pects "elegance" in its "architectural," structural makeup. Ease in stating   the problem, great difficulty in getting hold of it and in all attempts at   approaching it, then again some very surprising twist by which the ap   proach, or some part of the approach, becomes easy, etc. Also, if the   deductions are lengthy or complicated, there should be some simple gen   eral principle involved, which "explains" the complications and detours,   reduces the apparent arbitrariness to a few simple guiding motivations,   etc. These criteria are clearly those of any creative art, and the existence   of some underlying empirical, worldly motif in the background often in   a very remote background overgrown by aestheticizing developments   and followed into a multitude of labyrinthine variants all this is much     The Mathematician 2063   more akin to the atmosphere of art pure and simple than to that of the  empirical sciences.   You will note that I have not even mentioned a comparison of mathe  matics with the experimental or with the descriptive sciences. Here the  differences of method and of the general atmosphere are too obvious.   I think that it is a relatively good approximation to truth which is  much too complicated to allow anything but approximations that mathe  matical ideas originate in empirics, although the genealogy is sometimes  long and obscure. But, once they are so conceived, the subject begins to  live a peculiar life of its own and is better compared to a creative one,  governed by almost entirely aesthetical motivations, than to anything else  and, in particular, to an empirical science. There is, however, a further  point which, I believe, needs stressing. As a mathematical discipline travels  far from its empirical source, or still more, if it is a second and third gen  eration only indirectly inspired by ideas coming from "reality," it is beset  with very grave dangers. It becomes more and more purely aestheticizing,  more and more purely Van pour Van. This need not be bad, if the field is  surrounded by correlated subjects, which still have closer empirical con  nections, or if the discipline is under the influence of men with an excep  tionally well-developed taste. But there is a grave danger that the subject  will develop along the line of least resistance, that the stream, so far from  its source, will separate into a multitude of insignificant branches, and that  the discipline will become a disorganized mass of details and complexities.  In other words, at a great distance from its empirical source, or after much  "abstract" inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration.  At the inception the style is usually classical; when it shows signs of be  coming baroque, then the danger signal is up. It would be easy to give  examples, to trace specific evolutions into the baroque and the very high  baroque, but this, again, would be too technical.   In any event, whenever this stage is reached, the only remedy seems  to me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: the reinjection of more  or less directly empirical ideas. I am convinced that this was a necessary  condition to conserve the freshness and the vitality of the subject and that  this will remain equally true in the future.     PART XIX     Mathematical Machines:  Can a Machine Think?     1. The General and Logical Theory of Automata   by JOHN VON NEUMANN   2. Can a Machine Think? by A. M. TURING   3. A Chess-Playing Machine by CLAUDE SHANNON     COMMENTARY ON   Automatic Computers     SELF-REGULATING machines are not new. A very early example  was a miniature windmill which, mounted at right angles to the sails  of a large windmill, would catch the wind and rotate the main structure  into the proper operating position. 1 The automatic fly-ball governor, in  dispensable to the use of steam power, was invented by James Watt. The  now-commonplace thermostat is an example of the feedback principle  which is at the heart of all self-regulating mechanisms. Feedback is the  use of a fraction of the output of a machine to control the source of power  for that machine. When output rises beyond a determined point, this  power is throttled back; when output lags the power is increased. Thus  the machine is self-determining. The principle can be shown in a simple  diagram illustrating the "closed sequence" of control in a room thermo  stat;      The elements of the system are described as interdependent: the room  temperature, for example, is the cause of the thermometer reading; the  latter is also the cause, with the furnace as mediator, of the room tem  perature.   Feedback is also an essential component of those prodigious calculating  machines known as computers or, with chummy awe, "electronic brains."  Automatic computers have existed since the seventeenth century. Pascal  built an adding engine of which he was very proud; Leibniz made a  machine which could multiply. But neither of these computers was self-  regulating. They used toothed wheels so geared that turning one wheel a  certain number of notches caused the next wheel to revolve a single notch;   66 the excellent article > "Feedback," by Arnold Tustin, Scientific American, Sept.  pp. 48-55. The diagram is also from this source.   2066     Automatic Computers 2067   multiplication was accomplished by adding the same number over and  over again. 2 In the nineteenth century Charles Babbage, a remarkable  English mathematician who so hated organ-grinders that he crusaded  against them, conceived an elaborate computer which, he said, was capable  of "eating its own tail." 3 This machine, far ahead of its time, was un  fortunately never completed; but it is the true forerunner of the modern  digital computers.   In certain of their basic features, all computers are essentially the same  as Pascal's and Leibniz' inventions. They reduce higher mathematics to  arithmetic and arithmetic to counting. The vacuum tube does the same  job as the toothed wheel, but much faster. The great innovation of today's  computers is their capacity to regulate themselves by digesting information  which they themselves have produced. These machines cannot wonder,  but they can respond. Having received elaborate and precise instructions  as to the problem at hand, the computer proceeds to grind out figures at  a prodigious rate. In the course of this operation it in many ways apes  the process of a human calculation. The machine can organize its problem  into separate steps; it can use the results obtained in one step to execute  the next; sometimes partial results are laid aside, that is, "remembered,"  while an intermediate step is carried through; trial and error methods are  frequently used. Thus the computer guides itself by its own answers,  makes choices, comparisons, decisions. It is less like a man than is an  amoeba; nevertheless, it is more like a brain than any machine has ever  been before. It is close enough to make men shiver.   Mathematicians are interested in computers because they compute.  They take over menial and monotonous exercises and solve quickly prob  lems which would take men a long time and cost them immense labor.  But this in a sense is the least important and least interesting aspect of  computers. They draw the attention of the more original mathematicians  for other reasons. The goading question is how much such machines can  tell us about the human brain. What, for example, is to be learned from  them about the nature of information, how it is communicated, how  acted upon? What is the resemblance between the self-exciting and self-  stabilizing properties of automatic computers and similar properties of  human nerve circuits? Can one gain knowledge of the structure of the  brain by comparing restricted aspects of its input and output with the  input and output of computers (as well as of other self-regulating ma  chines) whose structure is known? It is thought that the machines can tell   2 See J.

Mathematicians are of course not alone in studying this subject; they  are allied with physicists, chemists, biologists, physiologists, psychologists  and other specialists in the sciences of human behavior. Research in this  sphere takes many forms. On the flourishing practical side engineers are  designing servo-mechanisms for innumerable specialized communications,  industrial and military purposes: robots to guide bombers, point guns, run  a refinery, monitor a telephone exchange, control machine tools and so  on. Electro-physiologists and other investigators are building machines  which can find their way out of labyrinths; which can respond to simple  stimuli (light, heat, sound, physical blows), recognize themselves or others  like them; which can be taught, after a certain number of trials, to disre  gard misleading clues, to distinguish between true and false leads. These  new creatures can do much more, as Bronowski says, than merely jump  when they are pinched. One more remarkable toy should be mentioned.  The British psychiatrist, Dr. Ross Ashby, has made a machine called a  homeostat which adapts itself to change and restores its internal stability  so that it can keep on doing in the new environment what it was doing  in the old. 4 "This creature, machina sopora, it might be called, is like a  fireside cat or dog which only stirs when disturbed, and then methodically  finds a comfortable position and goes to sleep again." 5   At the outposts of inquiry pure mathematicians and logicians are delv  ing into the correspondence between the functional aspects of the organi  zation of automata and of natural organisms. As you will see in Von  Neumann's piece, the purpose of this work is to develop the logical theory  of automata and, by applying axiomatic procedures, to draw conclusions  about the nature of large complex (and essentially incomprehensible)  organisms from the study of their component elements. These elements  are assumed to have "certain well-defined outside functional character  istics"; that is, they are treated as "black boxes" which we cannot look  into but about whose insides we can learn a good deal by checking the   4 "I have seen Dr. Ross Ashby remove the wiring from his odd machine, leave  out some 'and connect the rest at random. The machine balked, but it worked; after  a few minutes the machine pointer was again following the environment pointer."  Bronowski, he. cit. For a full discussion of Ashby's work, see Design for a Brain,  by W. Ross Ashby, New York, 1953.   5 "There are a number of electronic circuits similar to the reflex arcs in the spinal  cord of an animal. They are so combined with a number of thermionic tubes and  relays that out of 360,000 possible connections the machine will automatically find  one that leads to a condition of dynamic internal stability. That is, after several trials  and errors, the instrument, without any prompting or programming, establishes connec  tions which tend to neutralize any change that the experimenter tries to impose from  outside."

Can machines think? Is the question itself, for that matter, more than  a journalist's gambit? The English logician, A. M. Turing, 6 regards it as a  serious, meaningful question and one which can now be answered. He  thinks machines can think. He suggests that they can learn, that they can  be built so as to be able to do more than what we know how to order  them to do, that they may eventually "compete with men in all purely  intellectual fields." His conclusions are made plausible in the brilliantly  argued essay below. The selection by Claude Shannon neither supports nor  refutes Turing's expectations. It describes the design of an electronic com  puter which could play chess. Shannon is not sure whether his automaton  can be rated a thinker. The machine could play a complete game with  reasonable skill; it could also solve problems involving an enormous num  ber of individual calculations. (The author says such problems would be  "too laborious to carry out by hand"; he underestimates the insane per  tinacity of problem solvers.) Claude Shannon is a pioneer of communica  tion theory. A mathematician on the staff of Bell Telephone Laboratories,  he has written important papers on switching and mathematical logic and  has made fundamental contributions to the engineering aspects of com  munication and to the analysis of the nature of information. 7   6 Turing, one of the most gifted of modern mathematical logicians, took his own  life in a fit of despondency in the summer of 1954. For an obituary and an account of  his scientific papers, by M. H. A. Newman, see Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of  the Royal Society, 1955, Vol. 1, London, 1955. Of particular interest is Turing's 1937  paper, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem  (Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (2), 42,230). In this he argues that a machine which he  describes could be made to do any piece of work which could be done by a human  computer obeying explicit instructions given to him before the work starts. The ques  tion arises whether the machine could solve certain fundamental problem as to its own  capacity; that is, given a certain tape of instructions, is it possible for the machine  to decide whether the problem set on the tape has a determinate solution? Turing's  answer, in effect, says that unless the tape gives the method of solution, no machine  can solve it; moreover, no tape can give the method. Therefore the problem is insolu  ble in "an absolute and inescapable sense. From this basic insoluble problem it was  not difficult to infer that the Hilbert program of finding a decision method for the  axiomatic system, Z, of elementary number-theory, is also impossible."

MAURICE EVAN HARE (1905)     1 The General and Logical  Theory of Automata   By JOHN VON NEUMANN     . . . AUTOMATA have been playing a continuously increasing, and  have by now attained a very considerable, role in the natural sciences.  This is a process that has been going on for several decades. During the  last part of this period automata have begun to invade certain parts of  mathematics too particularly, but not exclusively, mathematical physics  or applied mathematics. Their role in mathematics presents an interesting  counterpart to certain functional aspects of organization in nature. Natural  organisms are, as a rule, much more complicated and subtle, and there  fore much less well understood in detail, than are artificial automata.  Nevertheless, some regularities which we observe in the organization of  the former may be quite instructive in our thinking and planning of the  latter; and conversely, a good deal of our experiences and difficulties with  our artificial automata can be to some extent projected on our interpreta  tions of natural organisms.   PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS   Dichotomy of the Problem: Nature of the Elements, Axiomatic Discus  sion of Their Synthesis. In comparing living organisms, and, in particular,  that most complicated organism, the human central nervous system, with  artificial automata, the following limitation should be kept in mind. The  natural systems are of enormous complexity, and it is clearly necessary to  subdivide the problem that they represent into several parts.- One method  of subdivision, which is particularly significant in the present context, is  this: The organisms can be viewed as made up of parts which to a certain   2070     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2071   extent are independent, elementary units. We may, therefore, to his extent,  view as the first part of the problem the structure and functioning of such  elementary units individually. The second part of the problem consists of  understanding how these elements are organized into a whole, and how  the functioning of the whole is expressed in terms of these elements. x   The first part of the problem is at present the dominant one in physi  ology. It is closely connected with the most difficult chapters of organic  chemistry and of physical chemistry, and may in due course be greatly  helped by quantum mechanics. I have little qualification to talk about it,  and it is not this part with which I shall concern myself here.   The second part, on the other hand, is the one which is likely to attract  those of us who have the background and the tastes of a mathematician or  a logician. With this attitude, we will be inclined to remove the first part  of the problem by the process of axiomatization, and concentrate on the  second one.   The Axiomatic Procedure. Axiomatizing the behavior of the elements  means this: We assume that the elements have certain well-defined, out  side, functional characteristics; that is, they are to be treated as "black  boxes." They are viewed as automatisms, the inner structure of which need  not be disclosed, but which are assumed to react to certain unambiguously  defined stimuli, by certain unambiguously defined responses.   This being understood, we may then investigate the larger organisms  that can be built up from these elements, their structure, their functioning,  the connections between the elements, and the general theoretical regu  larities that may be detectable in the complex syntheses of the organisms  in question.   I need not emphasize the limitations of this procedure. Investigators  of this type may furnish evidence that the system of c axioms used is con  venient and, at least in its effects, similar to reality. They are, however,  not the ideal method, and possibly not even a very effective method, to  determine the validity of the axioms. Such determinations of validity be  long primarily to the first part of the problem. Indeed they are essentially  covered by the properly physiological (or chemical or physical-chemical)  determinations of the nature and properties of the elements.   The Significant Orders of Magnitude. In spite of these limitations, how  ever, the "second part" as circumscribed above is important and difficult.  With any reasonable definition of what constitutes an element, the natural  organisms are very highly complex aggregations of these elements. The  number of cells in the human body is somewhere of the general order of  10 15 or 10 16 . The number of neurons in the central nervous system is  somewhere of the order of 10 10 . We have absolutely no past experience  with systems of this degree of complexity. All artificial automata made by  man have numbers of parts which by any comparably schematic count are     John von Neumann  2072   of the order 10 3 to 10 6 . In addition, those artificial systems which function  with that type of logical flexibility and autonomy that we find in the  natural organisms do not lie at the peak of this scale. The prototypes for  these systems are the modern computing machines, and here a reasonable   definition of what constitutes an element will lead to counts of a few times   10 3 or 10 4 elements.   DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN RELEVANT TRAITS OF  COMPUTING MACHINES   Computing Machines Typical Operations. Having made these general  remarks, let me now be more definite, and turn to that part of the subject  about which I shall talk in specific and technical detail. As I have indi  cated, it is concerned with artificial automata and more specially with  computing machines. They have some similarity to the central nervous  system, or at least to a certain segment of the system's functions. They  are of course vastly less complicated, that is, smaller in the sense which  really matters. It is nevertheless of a certain interest to analyze the prob  lem of organisms and organization from the point of view of these rela  tively small, artificial automata, and to effect their comparisons with the  central nervous system from this frog's-view perspective.  I shall begin by some statements about computing machines as such.  The notion of using an automaton for the purpose of computing is rela  tively new; While computing automata are not the most complicated  artificial automata from the point of view of the end results they achieve,  they do nevertheless represent the highest degree of complexity in the  sense that they produce the longest chains of events determining and fol  lowing each other.   There exists at the present time a reasonably well-defined set of ideas  about when it is reasonable to use a fast computing machine, and when  it is not. The criterion is usually expressed in terms of the multiplications  involved in the mathematical problem. The use of a fast computing ma  chine is believed to be by and large justified when the computing task  involves about a million multiplications or more in a sequence.   An expression in more fundamentally logical terms is this: In the rele  vant fields (that is, in those parts of [usually applied] mathematics, where  the use of such machines is proper) mathematical experience indicates  the desirability of precisions of about ten decimal places. A single multi  plication would therefore seem to involve at least 10 X 10 steps (digital  multiplications); hence a million multiplications amount to at least 10 R  operations. Actually, however, multiplying two decimal digits is not an  elementary operation. There are various ways of breaking it down into  such, and all of them have about the same degree of complexity. The     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2073   simplest way to estimate this degree of complexity is, instead of counting  decimal places, to count the number of places that would be required for  the same precision in the binary system of notation (base 2 instead of  base 10). A decimal digit corresponds to about three binary digits, hence  ten decimals to about thirty binary. The multiplication referred to above,  therefore, consists not of 10 X 10, but of 30 X 30 elementary steps, that  is, not 10 2 , but 10 3 steps. (Binary digits are "all or none" affairs, capable  of the values and 1 only. Their multiplication is, therefore, indeed an  elementary operation. By the way, the equivalent of 10 decimals is 33  [rather than 30] binaries but 33 X 33, too, is approximately 10 s .) It  follows, therefore, that a million multiplications in the sense indicated  above are more reasonably described as corresponding to 10 9 elementary  operations.   Precision and Reliability Requirements. I am not aware of any other  field of human effort where the result really depends on a sequence of a  billion (10 9 ) steps in any artifact, and where, furthermore, it has the  characteristic that every step actually matters or, at least, may 'matter  with a considerable probability. Yet, precisely this is true for computing  machines this is their most specific and most difficult characteristic.   Indeed, there have been in the last two decades automata which did  , perform hundreds of millions, or even billions, of steps before they pro  duced a result. However, the operation of these automata is not serial.  The large number of steps is due to the fact that, for a variety of reasons,  it is desirable to do the same experiment over and over again. Such  cumulative, repetitive procedures may, for instance, increase the size of  the result, that is (and this is the important consideration), increase the  significant result, the "signal," relative to the "noise" which contaminates  it. Thus any reasonable count of the number of reactions which a micro  phone gives before a verbally interpretable acoustic signal is produced is  in the high tens of thousands. Similar estimates in television will give tens  of millions, and in radar possibly many billions. If, however, any of these  automata makes mistakes, the mistakes usually matter only to the extent  of the fraction of the total number of steps which they represent. (This  is not exactly true in all relevant examples, but it represents the qualita  tive situation better than the opposite statement.) Thus the larger the  number of operations required to produce a result, the smaller will be the  significant contribution of every individual operation.   In a computing machine no such rule holds. Any step is (or may poten  tially be) as important as the whole result; any error can vitiate the result  in its entirety. (This statement is not absolutely true, but probably nearly  30 per cent of all steps made are usually of this sort.) Thus a computing  machine is one of the exceptional artifacts. They not only have to perform  a billion or more steps in a short time, but in a considerable part of the     2074 John von Neumann   procedure (and this is a part that is rigorously specified in advance) they  are permitted not a single error. In fact, in order to be sure that the whole  machine is operative, and that no potentially degenerative malfunctions  have set in, the present practice usually requires that no error should occur  anywhere in the entire procedure.   This requirement puts the large, high-complexity computing machines  in an altogether new light. It makes in particular a comparison between  the computing machines and the operation of the natural organisms not  entirely out of proportion.   The Analogy Principle. All computing automata fall into two great  classes in a way which is immediately obvious and which, as you will see  in a moment, carries over to living organisms. This classification is into  analogy and digital machines.   Let us consider the analogy principle first. A computing machine may  be based on the principle that numbers are represented by certain physical  quantities. As such quantities we might, for instance, use the intensity of  an electrical current, or the size of an electrical potential, or the number  of degrees of arc by which a disk has been rotated (possibly in conjunc  tion with the number of entire revolutions effected), etc. Operations like  addition, multiplication, and integration may then be performed by find  ing various natural processes which act on these quantities in the desired  way. Currents may be multiplied by feeding them into the two magnets  of a dynamometer, thus producing a rotation. This rotation may then be  transformed into an electrical resistance by the attachment of a rheostat;  and, finally, the resistance can be transformed into a current by connect  ing it to two sources of fixed (and different) electrical potentials. The  entire aggregate is thus a "black box" into which two currents are fed and  which produces a current equal to their product. You are certainly familiar  with many other ways in which a wide variety of natural processes can  be used to perform this and many other mathematical operations.   The first well-integrated, large, computing machine ever made was an  analogy machine, V. Bush's Differential Analyzer. This machine, by the  way, did the computing not with electrical currents, but with rotating  disks. I shall not discuss the ingenious tricks by which the angles of rota  tion of these disks were combined according to various operations of  mathematics.   I shall make no attempt to enumerate, classify, or systematize the wide  variety of analogy principles and mechanisms that can be used in com  puting. They are confusingly multiple. The guiding principle without which  it is impossible to reach an understanding of the situation is the classical  one of all "communication theory" the "signal to noise ratio," That is,  the critical question with every analogy procedure is this: How large are  the uncontrollable fluctuations of the mechanism that constitute the     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2075   "noise," compared to the significant "signals" that express the numbers  on which the machine operates? The usefulness of any analogy principle  depends on how low it can keep the relative size of the uncontrollable  fluctuations the "noise level."   To put this in another way. No analogy machine exists which will really  form the product of two numbers. What it will form is this product, plus  a small but unknown quantity which represents the random noise of the  mechanism and the physical processes involved. The whole problem is to  keep this quantity down. This principle has controlled the entire relevant  technology. It has, for instance, caused the adoption of seemingly compli  cated and clumsy mechanical devices instead of the simpler and elegant  electrical ones. (This, at least, has been the case throughout most of the  last twenty years. More recently, in certain applications which required  only very limited precision the electrical devices have again come to the  fore.) In comparing mechanical with electrical analogy processes, this  roughly is true: Mechanical arrangements may bring this noise level below  the "maximum signal level" by a factor of something like 1:10 4 or 10 5 .  In electrical arrangements, the ratio is rarely much better than 1:10 2 .  These ratios represent, of course, errors in the elementary steps of the cal  culation, and not in its final results. The latter will clearly be substantially  larger.   The Digital Principle. A digital machine works with the familiar method  of representing numbers as aggregates of digits. This is, by the way, the  procedure, which all of us use in our individual, non-mechanical com  puting, where we express numbers in the decimal system. Strictly speak  ing, digital computing need not be decimal. Any integer larger than one  may be used as the basis of a digital notation for numbers. The decimal  system (base 10) is the most common one, and all digital machines built  to date operate in this system. It seems likely, however, that the binary  (base 2) system will, in the end, prove preferable, and a number of digital  machines using that system are now under construction.   The basic operations in a digital machine are usually the four species  of arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We  might at first think that, in using these, a digital machine possesses (in  contrast to the analogy machines referred to above) absolute precision.  This, however, is not the case, as the following consideration shows.   Take the case of multiplication. A digital machine multiplying two  10-digit numbers will produce a 20-digit number, which is their product,  with no error whatever. To this extent its precision is absolute, even  though the electrical or mechanical components of the arithmetical organ  of the machine are as such of limited precision. As long as there is no  breakdown of some component, that is, as long as the operation of each  component produces only fluctuations within its preassigned tolerance     nA _,, John von Neumann   zu/o   limits, the result will be absolutely correct. This is, of course, the great and  characteristic virtue of the digital procedure. Error, as a matter of normal  operation and not solely (as indicated above) as an accident attributable  to some definite breakdown, nevertheless creeps in, in the following man  ner. The absolutely correct product of two 10-digit numbers is a 20-digit  number. If the machine is built to handle 10-digit numbers only, it will  have to disregard the last 10 digits of this 20-digit number and work with  the first 10 digits alone. (The small, though highly practical, improvement  due to a possible modification of these digits by "round-off" may be dis  regarded here.) If, on the other hand, the machine can handle 20-digit  numbers, then the multiplication of two such will produce 40 digits, and  these again have to be cut down to 20, etc., etc. (To conclude, no matter  what the maximum number of digits is for which the machine has been  built, hi the course of successive multiplications this maximum will be  reached, sooner or later. Once it has been reached, the next multiplication  will produce supernumerary digits, and the product will have to be cut to  half of its digits [the first half, suitably rounded off]. The situation for a  maximum of 10 digits, is therefore typical, and we might as well use it  to exemplify things.)   Thus the necessity of rounding off an (exact) 20-digit product to the  regulation (maximum) number of 10 digits, introduces in a digital ma  chine qualitatively the same situation as was found above in an analogy  machine. What it produces when a product is called for is not that product  itself, but rather the product plus a small extra term the round-off error.  This error is, of course, not a random variable like the noise in an analogy  machine. It is, arithmetically, completely determined in every particular  instance. Yet its mode of determination is so complicated, and its vari  ations throughout the number of instances of its occurrence in a problem  so irregular, that it usually can be treated to a high degree of approxima  tion as a random variable.   (These considerations apply to multiplication. For division the situation  is even slightly worse, since a quotient can, in general, not be expressed  with absolute precision by any finite number of digits. Hence here  rounding off is usually already a necessity after the first operation. For  addition and subtraction, on the other hand, this difficulty does not arise:  The sum or difference has the same number of digits [if there is no in  crease in size beyond the planned maximum] as the addends themselves.  Size may create difficulties which are added to the difficulties of precision  discussed here, but I shall not go into these at this time.)   The Role of the Digital Procedure in Reducing the Noise Level The  important difference between the noise level of a digital machine, as de  scribed above, and of an analogy machine is not qualitative at all; it is  quantitative. As pointed out above, the relative noise level of an analogy     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2077   machine is never lower than 1 in 10 5 , and in many cases as high as 1 in  10 2 . In the 10-place decimal digital machine referred to above the relative  noise level (due to round-off) is 1 part in 10 10 . Thus the real importance  of the digital procedure lies in its ability to reduce the computational  noise level to an extent which is completely unobtainable by any other  (analogy) procedure. In addition, further reduction of the noise level is  increasingly difficult in an analogy mechanism, and increasingly easy in a  digital one. In an analogy machine a precision of 1 in 10 3 is easy to  achieve; 1 in 10 4 somewhat difficult; 1 in 10 5 very difficult; and 1 in 10 e  impossible, in the present state of technology. In a digital machine, the  above precisions mean merely that one builds the machine to 3, 4, 5, and  6 decimal places, respectively. Here the transition from each stage to the  next one gets actually easier. Increasing a 3-place machine (if anyone  wished to build such a machine) to a 4-place machine is a 33 per cent  increase; going from 4 to 5 places, a 25 per cent increase; going from 5  to 6 places, a 20 per cent increase. Going from 10 to 11 places is only a  10 per cent increase. This is clearly an entirely different milieu, from the  point of view of the reduction of "random noise," from that of physical  processes. It is here and not in its practically ineffective absolute re  liability that the importance of the digital procedure lies.     COMPARISONS BETWEEN COMPUTING MACHINES AND  LIVING ORGANISMS   Mixed Character of Living Organisms. When the central nervous sys  tem is examined, elements of both procedures, digital and analogy, are  discernible.   The neuron transmits an impulse. This appears to be its primary func  tion, even if the last word about this function and its exclusive or non  exclusive character is far from having been said. The nerve impulse seems  in the main to be an all-or-none affair, comparable to a binary digit. Thus  a digital element is evidently present, but it is equally evident that this is  not the entire story. A great deal of what goes on in the organism is not  mediated in this manner, but is dependent on the general chemical com  position of the blood stream or of other humoral media. It is well known  that there are various composite functional sequences in the organism  which have to go through a variety of steps from the original stimulus to  the ultimate effect some of the steps being neural, that is, digital, and  others humoral, that is, analogy. These digital and analogy portions in  such a chain may alternately multiply. In certain cases of this type, the  chain can actually feed back into itself, that is, its ultimate output may  again stimulate its original input.   It is well known that such mixed (part neural and part humoral) feed-     2Q 7 g John von Neumann   back chains can produce processes of great importance. Thus the mecha  nism which keeps the blood pressure constant is of this mixed type. The  nerve which senses and reports the blood pressure does it by a sequence  of neural impulses, that is, in a digital manner. The muscular contraction  which this impulse system induces may still be described as a superposition  of many digital impulses. The influence of such a contraction on the blood  stream is, however, hydrodynamical, and hence analogy. The reaction of  the pressure thus produced back on the nerve which reports the pressure  closes the circular feedback, and at this point the analogy procedure again  goes over into a digital one. The comparisons between the living organisms  and the computing machines are, therefore, certainly imperfect at this  point. The living organisms are very complex part digital and part  analogy mechanisms. The computing machines, at least in their recent  forms to which I am referring in this discussion, are purely digital. Thus  I must ask you to accept this oversimplification of the system. Although  I am well aware of the analogy component in living organisms, and it  would be absurd to deny its importance, I shall, nevertheless, for the sake  of the simpler discussion, disregard that part. I shall consider the living  organisms as if they were purely digital automata.   Mixed Character of Each Element. In addition to this, one may argue  that even the neuron is not exactly a digital organ. This point has been put  forward repeatedly and with great force. There is certainly a great deal of  truth in it, when one considers things in considerable detail The relevant  assertion is, in this respect, that the fully developed nervous impulse, to  which all-or-none character can be attributed, is not an elementary phe  nomenon, but is highly complex. It is a degenerate state of the complicated  electrochemical complex which constitutes the neuron, and which in its  fully analyzed functioning must be viewed as an analogy machine. Indeed,  it is possible to stimulate the neuron in such a way that the breakdown  that releases the nervous stimulus will not occur. In this area of "sub  liminal stimulation," we find first (that is, for the weakest stimulations)  responses which are proportional to the stimulus, and then (at higher, but  still subliminal, levels of stimulation) responses which depend on more  complicated non-linear laws, but are nevertheless continuously variable  and not of the breakdown type. There are also other complex phenomena  within and without the subliminal range: fatigue, summation, certain  forms of self-oscillation, etc.   In spite of the truth of these observations, it should be remembered  that they may represent an improperly rigid critique of the concept of an  all-or-none organ. The electromechanical relay, or the vacuum tube, when  properly used, are undoubtedly all-or-none organs. Indeed, they are the  prototypes of such organs. Yet both of them are in reality complicated  analogy mechanisms, which upon appropriately adjusted stimulation re-     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2079   spend continuously, linearly or non-linearly, and exhibit the phenomena  of "breakdown" or "all-or-none" response only under very particular con  ditions of operation. There is little difference between this performance  and the above-described performance of neurons. To put it somewhat dif  ferently. None of these is an exclusively all-or-none organ (there is little  in our technological or physiological experience to indicate that absolute  all-or-none organs exist); this, however, is irrelevant. By an all-or-none  organ we should rather mean one which fulfills the following two condi  tions. First, it functions in the all-or-none manner under certain suitable  operating conditions. Second, these operating conditions are the ones  under which it is normally used; they represent the functionally normal  state of affairs within the large organism, of which it forms a part. Thus  the important fact is not whether an organ has necessarily and under all  conditions the all-or-none character this is probably never the case but  rather whether in its proper context it functions primarily, and appears  to be intended to function primarily, as an all-or-none organ. I realize that  this definition brings in rather undesirable criteria of "propriety" of con  text, of "appearance" and "intention." I do not see, however, how we can  avoid using them, and how we can forego counting on the employment  of common sense in their application. I shall, accordingly, in what follows  use the working hypothesis that the neuron is an all-or-none digital organ.  I realize that the last word about this has not been said, but I hope that  the above excursus on the limitations of this working hypothesis and the  reasons for its use will reassure you. I merely want to simplify my discus  sion; I am not trying to prejudge any essential open question.   In the same sense, I think that it is permissible to discuss the neurons  as electrical organs. The stimulation of a neuron, the development and  progress of its impulse, and the stimulating effects of the impulse at a  synapse can all be described electrically. The concomitant chemical and  other processes are important in order to understand the internal function  ing of a nerve cell. They may even be more important than the electrical  phenomena. They seem, however, to be hardly necessary for a description  of a neuron as a "black box," an organ of the all-or-none type. Again  the situation is no worse here than it is for, say, a vacuum tube. Here,  too, the purely electrical phenomena are accompanied by numerous other  phenomena of solid state physics, thermodynamics, mechanics. All of  these are important to understand the structure of a vacuum tube, but are  best excluded from the discussion, if it is to treat the vacuum tube as a  "black box" with a schematic description.   The Concept of a Switching Organ or Relay Organ. The neuron, as  well as the vacuum tube, viewed under the aspects discussed above, are  then two instances of the same generic entity, which it is customary to  call a "switching organ" or "relay organ." (The electromechanical relay     2080     John von Neumann     is, of course, another instance.) Such an organ is defined as a "black box,"  which responds to a specified stimulus or combination of stimuli by an  energetically independent response. That is, the response is expected to  have enough energy to cause several stimuli of the same kind as the ones  which initiated it. The energy of the response, therefore, cannot have been  supplied by the original stimulus. It must originate in a different and in  dependent source of power. The stimulus merely directs, controls the flow  of energy from this source.   (This source, in the case of the neuron, is the general metabolism of  the neuron. In the case of a vacuum tube, it is the power which main  tains the cathode-plate potential difference, irrespective of whether the  tube is conducting or not, and to a lesser extent the heater power which  keeps "boiling" electrons out of the cathode. In the case of the electro  mechanical relay, it is the current supply whose path the relay is closing  or opening.)   The basic switching organs of the living organisms, at least to the extent  to which we are considering them here, are the neurons. The basic switch  ing organs of the recent types of computing machines are vacuum tubes;  in older ones they were wholly or partially electromechanical relays. It is  quite possible that computing machines will not always be primarily aggre  gates of switching organs, but such a development is as yet quite far in  the future. A development which may lie much closer is that the vacuum  tubes may be displaced from their role of switching organs in computing  machines. This, too, however, will probably not take place for a few  years yet. I shall, therefore, discuss computing machines solely from  the point of view of aggregates of switching organs which are vacuum  tubes.   Comparison of the Sizes of Large Computing Machines and Living  Organisms. Two well-known, very large vacuum tube computing machines  are in existence and in operation. Both consist of about 20,000 switching  organs. One is a pure vacuum tube machine. (It belongs to the U. S.  Army Ordnance Department, Ballistic Research Laboratories,, Aberdeen,  Maryland, designation "ENIAC.") The other is mixed part vacuum tube  and part electromechanical relays. (It belongs to the I. B. M. Corporation,  and is located in New York, designation "SSEC.") These machines are a  good deal larger than what is likely to be the size of the vacuum tube  computing machines which will come into existence and operation in the  next few years. It is probable that each one of these will consist of 2000  to 6000 switching organs. (The reason for this decrease lies in a different  attitude about the treatment of the "memory," which I will not discuss  here.) It is possible that in later years the machine sizes will increase  again, but it is not likely that 10,000 (or perhaps a few times 10,000)  switching organs will be exceeded as long as the present techniques and     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2081   philosophy are employed. To sum up, about 10 4 switching organs seem  to be the proper order of magnitude for a computing machine.   In contrast tq this, the number of neurons in the central nervous system  has been variously estimated as something of the order of 10 10 . I do not  know how good this figure is, but presumably the exponent at least is not  too high, and not too low by more than a unit. Thus it is very conspicuous  that the central nervous system is at least a million times larger than the  largest artificial automaton that we can talk about at present. It is quite  interesting to inquire why this should be so and what questions of prin  ciple are involved. It seems to me that a few very clear-cut questions of  principle are indeed involved.   Determination of the Significant Ratio of Sizes for the Elements. Obvi  ously, the vacuum tube, as we know it, is gigantic compared to a nerve  cell. Its physical volume is about a billion times larger, and its energy  dissipation is about a billion times greater. (It is, of course, impossible to  give such figures with a unique validity, but the above ones are typical.)  There is, on the other hand, a certain compensation for this. Vacuum  tubes can be made to operate at exceedingly high speeds in applications  other than computing machines, but these need not concern us here. In  computing machines the maximum is a good deal lower, but it is still quite  respectable. In the present state of the art, it is generally believed to be  somewhere around a million actuations per second. The responses of a  nerve cell are a good deal slower than this, perhaps %ooo of a second, and  what really matters, the minimum time-interval required from stimulation  to complete recovery and, possibly, renewed stimulation, is still longer  than this at best approximately %oo of a second. This gives a ratio of  1 : 5000, which, however, may be somewhat too favorable to the vacuum  tube, since vacuum tubes, when used as switching organs at the 1,000,000  steps per second rate, are practically never run at a 100 per cent duty  cycle. A ratio like 1 : 2000 would, therefore, seem to be more equitable.  Thus the vacuum tube, at something like a billion times the expense, out  performs the neuron by a factor of somewhat over 1000. There is, there  fore, some justice in saying that it is less efficient by a factor of the order  of a million.   The basic fact is, in every respect, the small size of the neuron com  pared to the vacuum tube. This ratio is about a billion, as pointed out  above. What is it due to?   Analysis of the Reasons for the Extreme Ratio of Sizes. The origin of  this discrepancy lies in the fundamental control organ or, rather, control  arrangement of the vacuum tube as compared to that of the neuron. In  the vacuum tube the critical area of control is the space between the  cathode (where the active agents, the electrons, originate) and the grid  (which controls the electron flow). This space is about one millimeter     John von Neumann  2082   deep. The corresponding entity in a neuron is the wall of the nerve cell,  the "membrane." Its thickness is about a micron (%ooo millimeter), or  somewhat less. At this point, therefore, there is a ratio of approximately  1:1000 in linear dimensions. This, by the way, is the main difference. The  electrical fields, which exist in the controlling space, are about the same  for the vacuum tube and for the neuron. The potential differences by  which these organs can be reliably steered are tens of volts in one case  and tens of millivolts in the other. Their ratio is again about 1 : 1000, and  hence their gradients (the field strengths) are about identical. Now a ratio  of 1:1000 in linear dimensions corresponds to a ratio of 1:1,000,000,000  in volume. Thus the discrepancy factor of a billion in 3 -dimensional size  (volume) corresponds, as it should, to a discrepancy factor of 1000 in  linear size, that is, to the difference between the millimeter interelectrode-  space depth of the vacuum tube and the micron membrane thickness of  the neuron.   It is worth noting, although it is by no means surprising, how this  divergence between objects, both of which are microscopic and are situ  ated in the interior of the elementary components, leads to impressive  macroscopic differences between the organisms built upon them. This  difference between a millimeter object and a micron object causes the  ENIAC to weigh 30 tons and to dissipate 150 kilowatts of energy, while  the human central nervous system, which is functionally about a million  times larger, has the weight of the order of a pound and is accommodated  within the human skull. In assessing the weight and size of the ENIAC  as stated above, we should also remember that this huge apparatus is  needed in order to handle 20 numbers of 10 decimals each, that is, a total  of 200 decimal digits, the equivalent of about 700 binary digits merely  700 simultaneous pieces of "y es ~ no " information!   Technological Interpretation of These Reasons. These considerations  should make it clear that our present technology is still very imperfect  in handling information at high speed and high degrees of complexity. The  apparatus which results is simply enormous, both physically and in its  energy requirements.   The weakness of this technology lies probably, in part at least, in the  materials employed. Our present techniques involve the using of metals,  with rather close spacings, and at certain critical points separated by  vacuum only. This combination of media has a peculiar mechanical in  stability that is entirely alien to living nature. By this I mean the simple  fact that, if a living organism is mechanically injured, it has a strong  tendency to restore itself. If, on the other hand, we hit a man-made  mechanism with a sledge hammer, no such restoring tendency is apparent.  If two pieces of metal are close together, the small vibrations and other  mechanical disturbances, which always exist in the ambient medium, con-     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2083   stitute a risk in that they may bring them into contact. If they were at  different electrical potentials, the next thing that may happen after this  short circuit is that they can become electrically soldered together and the  contact becomes permanent. At this point, then, a genuine and permanent  breakdown will have occurred. When we injure the membrane of a nerve  cell, no such thing happens. On the contrary, the membrane will usually  reconstitute itself after a short delay.   It is this mechanical instability of our materials which prevents us from  reducing sizes further. This instability and other phenomena of a com  parable character make the behavior in our componentry less than wholly  reliable, even at the present sizes. Thus it is the inferiority of our mate  rials, compared with those used in nature, which prevents us from attain  ing the high degree of complication and the small dimensions which have  been attained by natural organisms.   THE FUTURE LOGICAL THEORY OF AUTOMATA   Further Discussion of the Factors That Limit the Present Size of Arti  ficial Automata. We have emphasized how the complication is limited in  artificial automata, that is, the complication which can be handled without  extreme difficulties and for which automata can still be expected to func  tion reliably. Two reasons that put a limit on complication in this sense  have already been given. They are the large size and the limited reliability  of the componentry that we must see, both of them due to the fact that  we are employing materials which seem to be quite satisfactory in simpler  applications, but marginal and inferior to the natural ones in this highly  complex application. There is, however, a third important limiting factor,  and we should now turn our attention to it. This factor is of an intellectual,  and not physical, character.   The Limitation Which Is Due to the Lack of a Logical Theory of  Automata. We are very far from possessing a theory of automata which  deserves that name, that is, a properly mathematical-logical theory. There  exists today a very elaborate system of formal logic, and, specifically, of  logic as applied to mathematics. This is a discipline with many good sides,  but also with certain serious weaknesses. This is not the occasion to en  large upon the good sides, which I have certainly no intention to belittle,  About the inadequacies, however, this may be said: Everybody who has  worked in formal logic will confirm that it is one of the technically most  refractory parts of mathematics. The reason for this is that it deals with  rigid, all-or-none concepts, and has very little contact with the continuous  concept of the real or of the complex number, that is, with mathematical  analysis. Yet analysis is the technically most successful and best-elaborated  part of mathematics. Thus formal logic is, by the nature of its approach,     John von Neumann  2084   cut off from the best cultivated portions of mathematics, and forced onto  the most difficult part of the mathematical terrain, into combinatorics.   The theory of automata, of the digital, all-or-none type, as discussed up  to now, is certainly a chapter in formal logic. It would, therefore, seem  that it will have to share this unattractive property of formal logic. It will  have to be, from the mathematical point of view, combinatorial rather   than analytical.   Probable Characteristics of Such a Theory. Now it seems to me that  this will in fact not be the case. In studying the functioning of automata,  it is clearly necessary to pay attention to a circumstance which has never  before made its appearance in formal logic.   Throughout all modern logic, the only thing that is important is whether  a result can be achieved in a finite number of elementary steps or not.  The size of the number of steps which are required, on the other hand,  is hardly ever a concern of formal logic. Any finite sequence of correct  steps is, as a matter of principle, as good as any other. It is a matter of  no consequence whether the number is small or large, or even so large  that it couldn't possibly be carried out in a lifetime, or in the presumptive  lifetime of the stellar universe as we know it. In dealing with automata,  this statement must be significantly modified. In the case of an automaton  the thing which matters is not only whether it can reach a certain result  in a finite number of steps at all but also how many such steps are needed.  -There are two reasons. First, automata are constructed in order to reach  certain results in certain pre-assigned durations, or at least in pre-assigned  orders of magnitude of duration. Second, the componentry employed has  on every individual operation a small but nevertheless non-zero probability  of failing. In a sufficiently long chain of operations the cumulative effect  of these individual probabilities of failure may (if unchecked) reach the  order of magnitude of unity at which point it produces, in effect, com  plete unreliability. The probability levels which are involved here are very  low, but still not too far removed from the domain of ordinary tech  nological experience. It is not difficult to estimate that a high-speed com  puting machine, dealing with a typical problem, may have to perform as  much as 10 12 individual operations. The probability of error on an indi  vidual operation which can be tolerated must, therefore, be small com  pared to 10~ 12 . I might mention that an electromechanical relay (a tele  phone relay) is at present considered acceptable if its probability of failure  on an individual operation is of the order 10~ 8 . It is considered excellent  if this order of probability is 10~ 9 . Thus the reliabilities required in a  high-speed computing machine are higher, but not prohibitively higher,  than those that constitute sound practice in certain existing industrial  fields. The actually obtainable reliabilities are, however, not likely to leave  a very wide margin against the minimum requirements just mentioned.     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2085   An exhaustive study and a non-trivial theory will, therefore, certainly be  called for,   Thus the logic of automata will differ from the present system of  formal logic in two relevant respects.   1. The actual length of "chains of reasoning," that is, of the chains of  operations, will have to be considered.   2. The operations of logic (syllogisms, conjunctions, disjunctions, nega  tions, etc., that is, in the terminology that is customary for automata,  various forms of gating, coincidence, anti-coincidence, blocking, etc.,  actions) will all have to be treated by procedures which allow exceptions  (malfunctions) with low but non-zero probabilities. All of this will lead  to theories which are much less rigidly of an all-or-none nature than past  and present formal logic. They will be of a much less combinatorial, and  much more analytical, character. In fact, there are numerous indications  to make us believe that this new system of formal logic will move closer  to another discipline which has been little linked in the past with logic.  This is thermodynamics, primarily in the form it was received from Boltz-  mann, and is that part of theoretical physics which comes nearest in some  of its aspects to manipulating and measuring information. Its techniques  are indeed much more analytical than combinatorial, which again illus  trates the point that I have been trying to make above. It would, however,  take me too far to go into this subject more thoroughly on this occasion.   All of this re-emphasizes the conclusion that was indicated earlier, that  a detailed, highly mathematical, and more specifically analytical, theory  of automata and of information is needed. We possess only the first indi  cations of such a theory at present. In assessing artificial automata, which  are, as I discussed earlier, of only moderate size, it has been possible to  get along in a rough, empirical manner without such a theory. There is  every reason to believe that this will not be possible with more elaborate  automata.   Effects of the Lack of a Logical Theory of A utomata on the Procedures  in Dealing with Errors. This, then, is the last, and very important, limiting  factor. It is unlikely that we could construct automata of a much higher  complexity than the ones we now have, without possessing a very ad  vanced and subtle theory of automata and information. A fortiori, this is  inconceivable for automata of such enormous complexity as is possessed  by the human central nervous system.   This intellectual inadequacy certainly prevents us from getting much  farther than we are now.   A simple manifestation of this factor is our present relation to error  checking. In living organisms malfunctions of components occur. The  organism obviously has a way to detect them and render them harmless.  It is easy to estimate that the number of nerve actuations which occur in     -,. John von Neumann   Zuoo   a normal lifetime must be of the order of 10 20 . Obviously, during this  chain of events there never occurs a malfunction which cannot be cor  rected by the organism itself, without any significant outside intervention.  The system must, therefore, contain the necessary arrangements to diag  nose errors as they occur, to readjust the organism so as to minimize the  effects of the errors, and finally to correct or to block permanently the  faulty components. Our modus procedendi with respect to malfunctions in  our artificial automata is entirely different. Here the actual practice, which  has the consensus of all experts of the field, is somewhat like this: Every  effort is made to detect (by mathematical or by automatical checks) every  error as soon as it occurs. Then an attempt is made to isolate the com  ponent that caused the error as rapidly as feasible. This may be done  partly automatically, but in any case a significant part of this diagnosis  must be effected by intervention from the outside. Once the faulty com  ponent has been identified, it is immediately corrected or replaced.   Note the difference in these two attitudes. The basic principle of deal  ing with malfunctions in nature is to make their effect as unimportant as  possible and to apply correctives, if they are necessary at all, at leisure. In  our dealings with artificial automata, on the other hand, we require an  immediate diagnosis. Therefore, we are trying to arrange the automata in  such a manner that errors will become as conspicuous as possible, and  intervention and correction follow immediately. In other words, natural  organisms are constructed to make errors as inconspicuous, as harmless,  as possible. Artificial automata are designed to make errors as conspicuous,  as disastrous, as possible. The rationale of this difference is not far to seek.  Natural organisms are sufficiently well conceived to be able to operate  even when malfunctions have set in. They can operate in spite of malfunc  tions, and their subsequent tendency is to remove these malfunctions. An  artificial automaton could certainly be designed so as to be able to operate  normally in spite of a limited number of malfunctions in certain limited  areas. Any malfunction, however, represents a considerable risk that some  generally degenerating process has already set in within the machine. It  is, therefore, necessary to intervene immediately, because a machine which  has begun to malfunction has only rarely a tendency to restore itself, and.  will more probably go from bad to worse. All of this comes back to one  thing. With our artificial automata we are moving much more in the dark  than nature appears to be with its organisms. We are, and apparently, at  least at present, have to be, much more "scared" by the occurrence of an  isolated error and by the malfunction which must be behind it. Our be  havior is clearly that of overcaution, generated by ignorance.   The Single-Error Principle. A minor side light to this is that almost all  our error-diagnosing techniques are based on the assumption that the  machine contains only one faulty component. In this case, iterative sub-     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2087   divisions of the machine into parts permit us to determine which portion  contains the fault. As soon as the possibility exists that the machine may  contain several faults, these, rather powerful, dichotomic methods of diag  nosis are lost. Error diagnosing then becomes an increasingly hopeless  proposition. The high premium on keeping the number of errors to be  diagnosed down to one, or at any rate as low as possible, again illustrates  our ignorance in this field, and is one of the main reasons why errors must  be made as conspicuous as possible, in order to be recognized and appre  hended as soon after their occurrence as feasible, that is, before further  errors have had time to develop.     PRINCIPLES OF DIGITALIZATION   Digitalization of Continuous Quantities: the Digital Expansion Method  and the Counting Method. Consider the digital part of a natural organism;  specifically, consider the nervous system. It seems that we are indeed  justified in assuming that this is a digital mechanism, that it transmits  messages which are made up of signals possessing the all-or-none char  acter. (See also the earlier discussion, page 2078.) In other words, each  elementary signal, each impulse, simply either is or is not there, with no  further shadings. A particularly relevant illustration of this fact is fur  nished by those cases where the underlying problem has the opposite char  acter, that is, where the nervous system is actually called upon to transmit  a continuous quantity. Thus the case of a nerve which has to report on  the value of a pressure is characteristic.   Assume, for example, that a pressure (clearly a continuous quantity) is  to be transmitted. It is well known how this trick is done. The nerve which  does it still transmits nothing but individual all-or-none impulses. How  does it then express the continuously numerical value of pressure in terms  of these impulses, that is, of digits? In other words, how does it encode a  continuous number into a digital notation? It does certainly not do it by  expanding the number in question into decimal (or binary, or any other  base) digits in the conventional sense. What appears to happen is that it  transmits pulses at a frequency which varies and which is within certain  limits proportional to the continuous quantity in question, and generally a  monotone function of it. The mechanism which achieves this "encoding"  is, therefore, essentially a frequency modulation system.   The details are known. The nerve has a finite recovery time. In other  words, after it has been pulsed once, the time that has to lapse before  another stimulation is possible is finite and dependent upon the strength  of the ensuing (attempted) stimulation. Thus, if the nerve is under the  influence of a continuing stimulus (one which is uniformly present at all  times, like the pressure that is being considered here), then the nerve will     .-- John von Neumann   2088   respond periodically, and the length of the period between two successive  stimulations is the recovery time referred to earlier, that is, a function of  the strength of the constant stimulus (the pressure in the present case).  Thus, under a high pressure, the nerve may be able to respond every 8  milliseconds, that is, transmit at the rate of 125 impulses per second; while  under the influence of a smaller pressure it may be able to repeat only  every 14 milliseconds, that is, transmit at the rate of 71 times per second.  This is very clearly the behavior of a genuinely yes-or-no organ, of a  digital organ. It is very instructive, however, that it uses a "count" rather  than a "decimal expansion" (or "binary expansion," etc.) method.   Comparison of the Two Methods. The Preference of Living Organisms  for the Counting Method. Compare the merits and demerits of these two  methods. The counting method is certainly less efficient than the expan  sion method. In order to express a number of about a million (that is, a  physical quantity of a million distinguishable resolution-steps) by count  ing, a million pulses have to be transmitted. In order to express a number  of the same size by expansion, 6 or 7 decimal digits are needed, that is,  about 20 binary digits. Hence, in this case only 20 pulses are needed.  Thus our expansion method is much more economical in notation than  the counting methods which are resorted to by nature. On the other hand,  the counting method has a high stability and safety from error. If you  express a number of the order of a million by counting and miss a count,  the result is only irrelevantly changed. If you express it by (decimal or  binary) expansion, a single error in a single digit may vitiate the entire  result. Thus the undesirable trait of our computing machines reappears  in our digital expansion system, in fact, the former is clearly deeply con  nected with, and partly a consequence of, the latter. The high stability  and nearly error-proof character of natural organisms, on the other hand,  is reflected in the counting method that they seem to use in this case. All  of this reflects a general rule. You can increase the safety from error by  a reduction of the efficiency of the notation, or, to say it positively, by  allowing redundancy of notation. Obviously, the simplest form of achiev  ing safety by redundancy is to use the, per se, quite unsafe digital expan  sion notation, but to repeat every such message several times. In the case  under discussion, nature has obviously resorted to an even more redun  dant and even safer system.   There are, of course, probably other reasons why the nervous system  uses the counting rather than the digital expansion. The encoding-decoding  facilities required by the former are much simpler than those required by  the latter. It is true, however, that nature seems to be willing and able to  go much further in the direction of complication than we are, or rather  than we can afford to go. One may, therefore, suspect that if the only  demerit of the digital expansion system were its greater logical complexity,     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2089   nature would not, for this reason alone, have rejected it. It is, nevertheless,  true that we have nowhere an indication of its use in natural organisms.  It is difficult to tell how much "final" validity one should attach to this  observation. The point deserves at any rate attention, and should receive  it in future investigations of the functioning of the nervous system.     FORMAL NEURAL NETWORKS   The McCulloch-Pitts Theory of Formal Neural Networks. A great deal  more could be said about these things from the logical and the organiza  tional point of view, but I shall not attempt to say it here. I shall instead  go on to discuss what is probably the most significant result obtained with  the axiomatic method up to now. I mean the remarkable theorems of Mc-  Culloch and Pitts on the relationship of logics and neural networks.   In this discussion I shall, as I have said, take the strictly axiomatic  point of view. I shall, therefore, view a neuron as a "black box" with a  certain number of inputs that receive stimuli and an output that emits  stimuli. To be specific, I shall assume that the input connections of each  one of these can be of two types, excitatory and inhibitory. The boxes  themselves are also of two types, threshold 1 and threshold 2. These con  cepts are linked and circumscribed by the following definitions. In order  to stimulate such an organ it is necessary that it should receive simultane  ously at least as many stimuli on its excitatory inputs as correspond to its  threshold, and not a single stimulus on any one of its inhibitory inputs. If  it has been thus stimulated, it will after a definite time delay (which is  assumed to be always the same, and may be used to define the unit of  time) emit an output pulse. This pulse can be taken by appropriate con  nections to any number of inputs of other neurons (also to any of its own  inputs) and will produce at each of these the same type of input stimulus  as the ones described above.   It is, of course, understood that this is an oversimplification of the  actual functioning of a neuron. I have already discussed the character, the  limitations, and the advantages of the axiomatic method. (See pages 2071  and 2078.) They all apply here, and the discussion which follows is to be  taken in this sense.   McCulloch and Pitts have used these units to build up complicated  networks which may be called "formal neural networks." Such a system  is built up of any number of these units, with their inputs and outputs  suitably interconnected with arbitrary complexity. The "functioning" of  such a network may be defined by singling out some of the inputs of the  entire system and some of its outputs, and then describing what original  stimuli on the former are to cause what ultimate stimuli on the latter,   The Main Result of the McCulloch-Pitts Theory. McCulloch and Pitts'     _ Artrt John von Neumann   2090   important result is that any functioning in this sense which can be defined  at all logically, strictly, and unambiguously in a finite number of words  can also be realized by such a formal neural network.   It is well to pause at this point and to consider what the implications  are. It has often been claimed that the activities and functions of the  human nervous system are so complicated that no ordinary mechanism  could possibly perform them. It has also been attempted to name specific  functions which by their nature exhibit this limitation. It has been at  tempted to show that such specific functions, logically, completely  described, are per se unable of mechanical, neural realization. The  McCulloch-Pitts result puts an end to this. It proves that anything that  can be exhaustively and unambiguously described, anything that can be  completely and unambiguously put into words, is ipso facto realizable by  a suitable finite neural network. Since the converse statement is obvious,  we can therefore say that there is no difference between the possibility of  describing a real or imagined mode of behavior completely and unambigu  ously in words, and the possibility of realizing it by a finite formal neural  network. The two concepts are co-extensive. A difficulty of principle  embodying any mode of behavior in such a network can exist only if we  are also unable to describe that behavior completely.   Thus the remaining problems are these two. First, if a certain mode of  behavior can be effected by a finite neural network, the question still  remains whether that network can be realized within a practical size,  specifically, whether it will fit into the physical limitations of the organism  in question. Second, the question arises whether every existing mode of  behavior can really be put completely and unambiguously into words.   The first problem is, of course, the ultimate problem of nerve physiol  ogy, and I shall not attempt to go into it any further here. The second  question is of a different character, and it has interesting logical con  notations.   Interpretations of This Result. There is no doubt that any special phase  of any conceivable form of behavior can be described "completely and  unambiguously" in words. This description may be lengthy, but it is always  possible. To deny it would amount to adhering to a form of logical mysti  cism which is surely far from most of us. It is, however, an important  limitation, that this applies only to every element separately, and it is far  from clear how it will apply to the entire syndrome of behavior. To be  more specific, there is no difficulty in describing how an organism might  be able to identify any two rectilinear triangles, which appear on the  retina, as belonging to the same category "triangle." There is also no diffi  culty in adding to this, that numerous other objects, besides regularly  drawn rectilinear triangles, will also be classified and identified as triangles     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2091   triangles whose sides are curved, triangles whose sides are not fully  drawn, triangles that are indicated merely by a more or less homogeneous  shading of their interior, etc. The more completely we attempt to describe  everything that may conceivably fall under this heading, the longer the  description becomes. We may have a vague and uncomfortable feeling  that a complete catalogue along such lines would not only be exceedingly  long, but also unavoidably indefinite at its boundaries. Nevertheless, this  may be a possible operation.   All of this, however, constitutes only a small fragment of the more  general concept of identification of analogous geometrical entities. This,  in turn, is only a microscopic piece of the general concept of analogy.  Nobody would attempt to describe and define within any practical amount  of space the general concept of analogy which dominates our interpreta  tion of vision. There is no basis for saying whether such an enterprise  would require thousands or millions or altogether impractical numbers of  volumes. Now it is perfectly possible that the simplest and only practical  way actually to say what constitutes a visual analogy consists in giving a  description of the connections of the visual brain. We are dealing here  with parts of logics with which we have practically no past experience.  The order of complexity is out of all proportion to anything we have ever  known. We have no right to assume that the logical notations and proce  dures used in the past are suited to this part of the subject. It is not at all  certain that in this domain a real object might not constitute the simplest  description of itself, that is, any attempt to describe it by the usual literary  or formal-logical method may lead to something less manageable and  more involved. In fact, some results in modern logic would tend to indi  cate that phenomena like this have to_be expected when we come to really  complicated entities. It is, therefore, not at all unlikely that it is futile to  look for a precise logical concept, that is, for a precise verbal description,  of "visual analogy." It is possible that the connection pattern of the visual  brain itself is the simplest logical expression or definition of this principle.   Obviously, there is on this level no more profit in the McCulloch-Pitts  result. At this point it only furnishes another illustration of the situation  outlined earlier. There is an equivalence between logical principles and  their embodiment in a neural network, and while in the simpler cases the  principles might furnish a simplified expression of the network, it is quite  possible that in cases of extreme complexity the reverse is true.   All of this does not alter my belief that a new, essentially logical, theory  is called for in order to understand high-complication automata and, in  particular, the central nervous system. It may be, however, that in this  process logic will have to undergo a pseudomorphosis to neurology to a  much greater extent than the reverse. The foregoing analysis shows that     ^ ^ John von Neumann   2092   one of the relevant things we can do at this moment with respect to the  theory of the central nervous system is to point out the directions in which  the real problem does not lie.     THE CONCEPT OF COMPLICATION; SELF-REPRODUCTION   The Concept of Complication. The discussions so far have shown that  high complexity plays an important role in any theoretical effort relating  to automata, and that this concept, in spite of its prima facie quantitative  character, may in fact stand for something qualitative for a matter of  principle. For the remainder of my discussion I will consider a remoter  implication of this concept, one which makes one of the qualitative aspects  of its nature even more explicit.   There is a very obvious trait, of the "vicious circle" type, in nature, the  simplest expression of which is the fact that very complicated organisms  can reproduce themselves.   We are all inclined to suspect in a vague way the existence of a concept  of "complication." This concept and its putative properties have never  been clearly formulated. We are, however, always tempted to assume that  they will work in this way. When an automaton performs certain opera  tions, they must be expected to be of a lower degree of complication than  the automaton itself. In particular, if an automaton has the ability to  construct another one, there must be a decrease in complication as we go  from the parent to the construct. That is, if A can produce 5, then A in  some way must have contained a complete description of B. In order to  make it effective, there must be, furthermore, various arrangements in A  that see to it that this description is interpreted and that the constructive  operations that it calls for are carried out, In this sense, it would therefore  seem that a certain degenerating tendency must be expected, some de  crease in complexity as one automaton makes another automaton.   Although this has some indefinite plausibility to it, it is in clear contra  diction with the most obvious things that go on in nature. Organisms  reproduce themselves, that is, they produce new organisms with no de  crease in complexity. In addition, there are long periods of evolution  during which the complexity is even increasing. Organisms are indirectly  derived from others which had lower complexity.   Thus there exists an apparent conflict of plausibility and evidence, if  nothing worse. In view of this, it seems worth while to try to see whether  there is anything involved here which can be formulated rigorously.   So far I have been rather vague and confusing, and not unintentionally  at that. It seems to me that it is otherwise impossible to give a fair  impression of the situation that exists here. Let me now try to become  specific.     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2093   Turing's Theory of Computing Automata. The English logician, Turing,  about twelve years ago attacked the following problem.   He wanted to give a general definition of what is meant by a computing  automaton. The formal definition came out as follows:   An automaton is a "black box," which will not be described in detail  but is expected to have the following attributes. It possesses a finite num  ber of states, which need be prima facie characterized only by stating their  number, say n, and by enumerating them accordingly: 1, 2, , n. The  essential operating characteristic of the automaton consists of describing  how it is caused to change its state, that is, to go over from a state i into a  state /'. This change requires some interaction with the outside world,  which will be standardized in the following manner. As far as the machine  is concerned, let the whole outside world consist of a long paper tape. Let  this tape be, say, 1 inch wide, and let it be subdivided into fields (squares)  1 inch long. On each field of this strip we may or may not put a sign,  say, a dot, and it is assumed that it is possible to erase as well as to write  in such a dot. A field marked with a dot will be called a "1," a field  unmarked with a dot will be called a "0." (We might permit more ways  of marking, but Turing showed that this is irrelevant and does not lead to  any essential gain in generality.) In describing the position of the tape  relative to the automaton it is assumed that one particular field of the tape  is under direct inspection by the automaton, and that the automaton has  the ability to move the tape forward and backward, say, by one field at a  time. In specifying this, let the automaton be in the state /(=!-,),  and let it see on the tape an e (= 0, 1) . It will then go over into the state  / (= 0, 1, , n), move the tape by p fields (p 0, +1, 1; +1 is a  move forward, 1 is a move backward), and inscribe into the new field  that it sees / (=0, 1; inscribing means erasing; inscribing 1 means put  ting in a dot) . Specifying 7, p, f as functions of i, e is then the complete  definition of the functioning of such an automaton.   Turing carried out a careful analysis of what mathematical processes  can be effected by automata of this type. In this connection he proved  various theorems concerning the classical "decision problem" of logic,  but I shall not go into these matters here. He did, however, also introduce  and analyze the concept of a "universal automaton," and this is part of  the subject that is relevant in the present context.   An infinite sequence of digits e (=0, 1) is one of the basic entities in  mathematics. Viewed as a binary expansion, it is essentially equivalent to  the concept of a real number. Turing, therefore, based his consideration  on these sequences.   He investigated the question as to which automata were able to con  struct which sequences. That is, given a definite law for the formation of  such a sequence, he inquired as to which automata can be used to form     John von Neumann   the sequence based on that law. The process of "forming" a sequence is  interpreted in this manner. An automaton is able to "form" a certain  sequence if it is possible to specify a finite length of tape, appropriately  marked, so that, if this tape is fed to the automaton in question, the  automaton will thereupon write the sequence on the remaining (infinite)  free portion of the tape. This process of writing the infinite sequence is,  of course, an indefinitely continuing one. What is meant is that the autom  aton will keep running indefinitely and, given a sufficiently long time, will  have inscribed any desired (but of course finite) part of the (infinite)  sequence. The finite, premarked, piece of tape constitues the "instruction"  of the automaton for this problem.   An automaton is "universal" if any sequence that can be produced by  any automaton at all can also be solved by this particular automaton. It  will, of course, require in general a different instruction for this purpose.   The Main Result of the Turing Theory. We might expect a priori that  this is impossible. How can there be an automaton which is at least as  effective as any conceivable automaton, including, for example, one of  twice its size and complexity?   Turing, nevertheless, proved that this is possible. While his construction  is rather involved, the underlying principle is nevertheless quite simple.  Turing observed that a completely general description of any conceivable  automaton can be (in the sense of the foregoing definition) given in a  finite number of words. This description will contain certain empty  passages those referring to the functions mentioned earlier (/', p, f in  terms of i, e) t which specify the actual functioning of the automaton.  When these empty passages are filled in, we deal with a specific automa  ton. As long as they are left empty, this schema represents the general  definition of the general automaton. Now it becomes possible to describe  an automaton which has the ability to interpret such a definition. In other  words, which, when fed the functions that in the sense described above  define a specific automaton, will thereupon function like the object de  scribed. The ability to do this is no more mysterious than the ability to  read a dictionary and a grammar and to follow their instructions about the  uses and principles of combinations of words. This automaton, which is  constructed to read a description and to imitate the object described, is  then the universal automaton in the sense of Turing. To make it duplicate  any operation that any other automaton can perform, it suffices to furnish  it with a description of the automaton in question and, in addition, with  the instructions which that device would have required for the operation  under consideration.   Broadening of the Program to Deal with Automata That Produce  Automata. For the question which concerns me here, that of "self-repro  duction" of automata, Turing's procedure is too narrow in one respect     The General and Logical Theory of Automata 2095   only. His automata are purely computing machines. Their output is a  piece of tape with zeros and ones on it. What is needed for the construc  tion to which I referred is an automaton whose output is other automata.  There is, however, no difficulty in principle in dealing with this broader  concept and in deriving from it the equivalent of Turing's result.   The Basic Definitions. As in the previous instance, it is again of primary  importance to give a rigorous definition of what constitutes an automaton  for the purpose of the investigation. First of all, we have to draw up a  :omplete list of the elementary parts to be used. This list must contain not  3nly a complete enumeration but also a complete operational definition of  ?ach elementary part. It is relatively easy to draw up such a list, that is, to  rate a catalogue of "machine parts" which is sufficiently inclusive to  permit the construction of the wide variety of mechanisms here required,  ind which has the axiomatic rigor that is needed for this kind of consider-  ition. The list need not be very long either. It can, of course, be made  jither arbitrarily long or arbitrarily short. It may be lengthened by includ-  ng in it, as elementary parts, things which could be achieved by combina-  ions of others. It can be made short in fact, it can be made to consist of  i single unit by endowing each elementary part with a multiplicity of  ittributes and functions. Any statement on the number of elementary  >arts required will therefore represent a common-sense compromise, in  vhich nothing too complicated is expected from any one elementary part,  ind no elementary part is made to perform several, obviously separate,  unctions. In this sense, it can be shown that about a dozen elementary  >arts suffice. The problem of self-reproduction can then be stated like this:  Dan one build an aggregate out of such elements in such a manner that if  t is put into a reservoir, in which there float all these elements in large  lumbers, it will then begin to construct other aggregates, each of which  rill at the end turn out to be another automaton exactly like the original  >ne? This is feasible, and the principle on which it can be based is closely  elated to Turing's principle outlined earlier.   Outline of the Derivation of the Theorem Regarding Self-reproduction.  7 irst of all, it is possible to give a complete description of everything  hat is an automaton in the sense considered here. This description is to  >e conceived as a general one, that is, it will again contain empty spaces.  These empty spaces have to be filled in with the functions which describe  he actual structure of an automaton. As before, the difference between  tiese spaces filled and unfilled is the difference between the description of   specific automaton and the general description of a general automaton,  'here is no difficulty of principle in describing the following automata.   (a) Automaton A, which when furnished the description of any other  utomaton in terms of appropriate functions, will construct that entity,  "he description should in this case not be given in the form of a marked     John von Neumann     2096   tape, as in Turing's case, because we will not normally choose a tape as a  structural element. It is quite easy, however, to describe combinations  of structural elements which have all the notational properties of a tape  with fields that can be marked. A description in this sense will be called  an instruction and denoted by a letter /.   "Constructing" is to be understood in the same sense as before. The  constructing automaton is supposed to be placed in a reservoir in which  all elementary components in large numbers are floating, and it will effect  its construction in that milieu. One need not worry about how a fixed  automaton of this sort can produce others which are larger and more  complex than itself. In this case the greater size and the higher complexity  of the object to be constructed will be reflected in a presumably still  greater size of the instructions / that have to be furnished. These instruc  tions, as pointed out, will have to be aggregates of elementary parts. In  this sense, certainly, an entity will enter the process whose size and com  plexity is determined by the size and complexity of the object to be  constructed. ^   In what follows, all automata for whose construction the facility A will  be used are going to share with A this property. All of them will have a  place for an instruction 7, that is, a place where such an instruction can  be inserted. When such an automaton is being described (as, for example,  by an appropriate instruction), the specification of the location for the  insertion of an instruction / in the foregoing sense is understood to form  a part of the description. We may, therefore, talk of "inserting a given  instruction 7 into a given automaton," without any further explanation.   (b) Automaton #, which can make a copy of any instruction 7 that  is furnished to it. 7 is an aggregate of elementary parts in the sense out  lined in (a), replacing a tape. This facility will be used when 7 furnishes  a description of another automaton. In other words, this automaton is  nothing more subtle than a "reproducer" the machine which can read a  punched tape and produce a second punched tape that is identical with  the first. Note that this automaton, too, can produce objects which are  larger and more complicated than itself. Note again that there is nothing  surprising about it. Since it can only copy, an object of the exact size and  complexity of the output will have to be furnished to it as input.   After these preliminaries, we can proceed to the decisive step.   (c) Combine the automata A and B with each other, and with a con  trol mechanism C which does the following. Let A be furnished with an  instruction 7 (again in the sense of [a] and [b]). Then C will first cause A  to construct the automaton which is described by this instruction 7. Next  C will cause B to copy the instruction 7 referred to above, and insert the  copy into the automaton referred to above, which has just been con-     The General and Logical Theory o1 Automata 2097   structed by A. Finally, C will separate this construction from the system  A + B + C and "turn it loose" as an independent entity.   (d) Denote the total aggregate A + B + C by D.   (e) In order to function, the aggregate D = A + B + C must be fur  nished with an instruction 7, as described above. This instruction, as  pointed out above, has to be inserted into A . Now form an instruction I D ,  which describes this automaton D, and insert I D into A within D. Call the  aggregate which now results E.   E is clearly self-reproductive. Note that no vicious circle is involved.  The decisive step occurs in E, when the instruction I D , describing D, is  constructed and attached to D. When the construction (the copying) of  I D is called for, D exists already, and it is in no wise modified by the  construction of I D . I D is simply added to form E. Thus there is a definite  chronological and logical order in which D and I D have to be formed,  and the process is legitimate and proper according to the rules of logic.   Interpretations of This Result and of Its Immediate Extensions. The  description of this automaton E has some further attractive sides, into  which I shall not go at this time at any length. For instance, it is quite  clear that the instruction I D is roughly effecting the functions of a gene.  It is also clear that the copying mechanism B performs the fundamental  act of reproduction, the duplication of the genetic material, which is  clearly the fundamental operation in the multiplication of living cells. It  is also easy to see how arbitrary alterations of the system E, and in par  ticular of /jr), can exhibit certain typical traits which appear in connection  with mutation, lethally as a rule, but with a possibility of continuing  reproduction with a modification of traits. It is, of course, equally clear  at which point the analogy ceases to be valid. The natural gene does prob  ably not contain a complete description of the object whose construction  its presence stimulates. It probably contains only general pointers, general  cues. In the generality in which the foregoing consideration is moving,  this simplification is not attempted. It is, nevertheless, clear that this  simplification, and others similar to it, are in themselves of great and  qualitative importance. We are very far from any real understanding of  the natural processes if we do not attempt to penetrate such simplifying  principles.   Small variations of the foregoing scheme also permit us to construct  automata which can reproduce themselves and, in addition, construct  others. (Such an automaton performs more specifically what is probably  a if not the typical gene function, self-reproduction plus production  or stimulation of production of certain specific enzymes.) Indeed, It  suffices to replace the I D by an instruction ID+ F , which describes the  automaton D plus another given automaton F. Let D, with I D+F inserted     2098 John von Neumann   into A within it, be designated by E F . This E F clearly has the property  already described. It will reproduce itself, and, besides, construct F.   Note that a "mutation" of E F , which takes place within the F-part of  1 D + F in E Ft is not lethal. If it replaces F by F', it changes E F into  JEjP, that is, the "mutant" is still self-reproductive; but its by-product is  changed F' instead of F. This is, of course, the typical non-lethal mutant.   All these are very crude steps in the direction of a systematic theory of  automata. They represent, in addition, only one particular direction. This  is, as I indicated before, the direction towards forming a rigorous concept  of what constitutes "complication." They illustrate that "complication"  on its lower levels is probably degenerative, that is, that every automaton  that can produce other automata will only be able to produce less compli  cated ones. There is, however, a certain minimum level where this degen  erative characteristic ceases to be universal. At this point automata which  can reproduce themselves, or even construct higher entities, become  possible. This fact, that complication, as well as organization, below a  certain minimum level is degenerative, and beyond that level can become  self-supporting and even increasing, will clearly play an important role in  any future theory of the subject.     Thinking is very far from knowing. PROVERB   Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet. EMERSON   For 'tis the sport to have the enginer   Hoist with his own petar . . . SHAKESPEARE (Hamlet)     2 Can a Machine Think?   By A. M. TURING   1. THE IMITATION GAME   I PROPOSE to consider the question, 'Can machines think?' This should  begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think.'  The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the  normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of  the words 'machine' and 'think' are to be found by examining how they  are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning  and the answer to the question, 'Can machines think?' is to be sought in  a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of  attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which  is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.   The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game  which we call the 'imitation game.' It is played with three people, a man  (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex.  The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of  the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the  man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at  the end of the game he says either 'X is A and Y is B' or 'X is B and Y is  A.' The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:   C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?  Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the  game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer  might therefore be   'My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long.'   In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers  should be written, or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is  to have a teleprinter communicating between the two rooms. Alternatively  the question and answers can be repeated by an intermediary. The object  of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator. The best  strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. -She can add such   2099     2100 A. M. Turing   things as 1 am the woman, don't listen to him!' to her answers, but it will  avail nothing as the man can make similar remarks.   We now ask the question, What will happen when a machine takes  the part of A in this game?' Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often  when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played  between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, 'Can  machines think?'   2. CRITIQUE OF THE NEW PROBLEM   As well as asking, 'What is the answer to this new form of the question,'  one may ask, 'Is this new question a worthy one to investigate?' This latter  question we investigate without further ado, thereby cutting short an  infinite regress.   The new problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line be  tween the physical and the intellectual capacities of a man. No engineer  or chemist claims to be able to produce a material which is indistinguish  able from the human skin. It is possible that at some time this might be  done, but even supposing this invention available we should feel there was  little point in trying to make a 'thinking machine' more human by dressing  it up in such artificial flesh. The form in which we have set the problem  reflects this fact in the condition which prevents the interrogator from  seeing or touching the other competitors, or hearing their voices. Some  other advantages of the proposed criterion may be shown up by specimen  questions and answers. Thus:   Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.   A: Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.   Q: Add 34957 to 70764.   A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621.   Q: Do you play chess?   A: Yes.   Q: I have K at my Kl, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6   and R at Rl. It is your move. What do you play?  A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate.   The question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing  almost any one of the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include.  We do not wish to penalise the machine for its inability to shine in beauty  competitions, nor to penalise a man for losing in a race against an aero  plane. The conditions of our game make these disabilities irrelevant. The  'witnesses' can brag, if they consider it advisable, as much as they please  about their charms, strength or heroism, but the interrogator cannot  demand practical demonstrations.   The game may perhaps be criticised on the ground that the odds are  weighted too heavily against the machine. If the man were to try and     Can a Machine Think? 2101   pretend to be the machine he would clearly make a very poor showing.  He would be given away at once by slowness and inaccuracy in arithmetic.  May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as  thinking but which is very different from what a man does? This objection  is a very strong one, but at least we can say that if, nevertheless, a ma  chine can be constructed to play the imitation game satisfactorily, we need  not be troubled by this objection.   It might be urged that when playing the 'imitation game' the best strat  egy for the machine may possibly be something other than imitation of  the behaviour of a man. This may be, but I think it is unlikely that there  is any great effect of this kind. In any case there is no intention to investi  gate here the theory of the game, and it will be assumed that the best  strategy is to try to provide answers that would naturally be given by a  man.   3. THE MACHINES CONCERNED IN THE GAME   The question which we put in 1 will not be quite definite until we have  specified what we mean by the word 'machine.' It is natural that we should  wish to permit every kind of engineering technique to be used in our  machines. We also wish to allow the possibility that an engineer or team  of engineers may construct a machine which works, but whose manner of  operation cannot be satisfactorily described by its constructors because  they have applied a method which is largely experimental. Finally, we  wish to exclude from the machines men born in the usual manner. It is  difficult to frame the definitions so as to satisfy these three conditions.  One might for instance insist that the team of engineers should be all of  one sex, but this would not really be satisfactory, for it is probably possible  to rear a complete individual from a single cell of the skin (say) of a  man. To do so would be a feat of biological technique deserving of the  very highest praise, but we would not be inclined to regard it as a case of  'constructing a thinking machine.' This prompts us to abandon the require  ment that every kind of technique should be permitted. We are the more  ready to do so in view of the fact that the present interest in 'thinking  machines' has been aroused by a particular kind of machine, usually called  an 'electronic computer' or 'digital computer.' Following this suggestion  we only permit digital computers to take part in our game.   This restriction appears at first sight to be a very drastic one. I shall  attempt to show that it is not so in reality. To do this necessitates a short  account of the nature and properties of these computers.   It may also be said that this identification of machines with digital  computers, like our criterion for 'thinking,' will only be unsatisfactory if  (contrary to my belief), it turns out that digital computers are unable to  give a good showing in the game.     2102 A. M. Turing   There are already a number of digital computers in working order, and  it may be asked, 'Why not try the experiment straight away? It would  be easy to satisfy the conditions of the game. A number of interrogators  could be used, and statistics compiled to show how often the right identi  fication was given.' The short answer is that we are not asking whether all  digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers  at present available would do well, but whether there are imaginable  computers which would do well. But this is only the short answer. We  shall see this question in a different light later.   4. DIGITAL COMPUTERS   The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that  these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be  done by a human computer. The human computer is supposed to be  following fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate from them in any  detail. We may suppose that these rules are supplied in a book, which is  altered whenever he is put on to a new job. He has also an unlimited  supply of paper on which he does his calculations. He may also do his  multiplications and additions on a 'desk machine,' but this is not  important.   If we use the above explanation as a definition we shall be in danger of  circularity of argument. We avoid this by giving an outline of the means  by which the desired effect is achieved. A digital computer can usually be  regarded as consisting of three parts:  (i) Store,  (ii) Executive unit.   (iii) Control.   The store is a store of information, and corresponds to the human com  puter's paper, whether this is the paper on which he does his calculations  or that on which his book of rules is printed. In so far as the human  computer does calculations in his head a part of the store will correspond  to his memory.   The executive unit is the part which carries out the various individual  operations involved in a calculation. What these individual operations are  will vary from machine to machine. Usually fairly lengthy operations can  be done such as 'Multiply 3540675445 by 7076345687' but in some  machines only very simple ones such as 'Write down 0' are possible.   We have mentioned that the 'book of rules' supplied to the computer is  replaced in the machine by a part of the store. It is then called the 'table  of instructions.' It is the duty of the control to see that these instructions  are obeyed correctly and in the right order. The control is so constructed  that this necessarily happens.     Can a Machine Think? 2103   The information in the store is usually broken up into packets of mod  erately small size. In one machine, for instance, a packet might consist of  ten decimal digits. Numbers are assigned to the parts of the store in which  the various packets of information are stored, in some systematic manner.  A typical instruction might say   'Add the number stored in position 6809 to that in 4302 and put the  result back into the latter storage position.'   Needless to say it would not occur in the machine expressed in English.  It would more likely be coded in a form such as 6809430217. Here 17  says which of various possible operations is to be performed on the two  numbers. In this case the operation is that described above, viz. 'Add the  number. . . .' It will be noticed that the instruction takes up 10 digits  and so forms one packet of information, very conveniently. The control  will normally take the instructions to be obeyed in the order of the  positions in which they are stored, but occasionally an instruction such as   'Now obey the instruction stored in position 5606, and continue from  there'  may be encountered, or again   'If position 4505 contains obey next the instruction stored in 6707,  otherwise continue straight on.'   Instructions of these latter types are very important because they make it  possible for a sequence of operations to be repeated over and over again  until some condition is fulfilled, but in doing so to obey, not fresh instruc  tions on each repetition, but the same ones over and over again. To take  a domestic analogy. Suppose Mother wants Tommy to call at the cobbler's  every morning on his way to school to see if her shoes are done, she can  ask him afresh every morning. Alternatively she can stick up a notice  once and for all in the hall which he will see when he leaves for school  and which tells him to call for the shoes, and also to destroy the notice  when he comes back if he has the shoes with him.   The reader must accept it as a fact that digital computers can be con  structed, and indeed have been constructed, according to the principles  we have described, and that they can in fact mimic the actions of a human  computer very closely.   The book of rules which we have described our human computer as  using is of course a convenient fiction. Actual human computers really  remember what they have got to do. If one wants to make a machine  mimic the behaviour of the human computer in some complex operation  one has to ask him how it is done, and then translate the answer into the  form of an instruction table. Constructing instruction tables is usually  described as 'programming.' To 'programme a machine to carry out the  operation A' means to put the appropriate instruction table into the  machine so that it will do A.     210 4 A - M - Turing   An interesting variant on the idea of a digital computer is a 'digital  computer with a random element.' These have instructions involving the  throwing of a die or some equivalent electronic process; one such instruc  tion might for instance be, 'Throw the die and put the resulting number  into store 1000.' Sometimes such a machine is described as having free  will (though I would not use this phrase myself). It is not normally possi  ble to determine from observing a machine whether it has a random ele  ment, for a similar effect can be produced by such devices as making the  choices depend on the digits of the decimal for ir.   Most actual digital computers have only a finite store. There is no  theoretical difficulty in the idea of a computer with an unlimited store. Of  course only a finite part can have been used at any one time. Likewise  only a finite amount can have been constructed, but we can imagine more  and more being added as required. Such computers have special theoreti  cal interest and will be called infinitive capacity computers.   The idea of a digital computer is an old one. Charles Babbage, Lucasian  Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge from 1828 to 1839, planned such  a machine, called the Analytical Engine, but it was never completed.  Although Babbage had all the essential ideas, his machine was not at that  time such a very attractive prospect. The speed which would have been  available would be definitely faster than a human computer but something  like 100 times slower than the Manchester machine, itself one of the  slower of the modern machines. The storage was to be purely mechanical,  using wheels and cards,   The fact that Babbage's Analytical Engine was to be entirely mechanical  will help us to rid ourselves of a superstition. Importance is often attached  to the fact that modern digital computers are electrical, and that the nerv  ous system also is electrical. Since Babbage's machine was not electrical,  and since all digital computers are in a sense equivalent, we see that this  use of electricity cannot be of theoretical importance. Of course electricity  usually comes in where fast signalling is concerned, so that it is not  surprising that we find it in both these connections. In the nervous system  chemical phenomena are at least as important as electrical. In certain  computers the storage system is mainly acoustic. The feature of using  electricity is thus seen to be only a very superficial similarity. If we wish  to find such similarities we should look rather for mathematical analogies  of function.   5. UNIVERSALITY OF DIGITAL COMPUTERS   The digital computers considered in the last section may be classified  amongst the 'discrete state machines.' These are the machines which move  by sudden jumps or clicks from one quite definite state to another. These  states are sufficiently different for the possibility of confusion between     Can a Machine Think? 2105   them to be ignored. Strictly speaking there are no such machines. Every  thing really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine  which can profitably be thought of as being discrete state machines. For  instance in considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient  fiction that each switch must be definitely on or definitely off. There must  be intermediate positions, but for most purposes we can forget about them.  As an example of a discrete state machine we might consider a wheel  which clicks round through 120 once a second, but may be stopped by  a lever which can be operated from outside; in addition a lamp is to light  in one of the positions of the wheel. This machine could be described  abstractly as follows. The internal state of the machine (which is described  by the position of the wheel) may be q^ q% or q z . There is an input signal  z* or fj (position of lever) . The internal state at any moment is determined  by the last state and input signal according to the table     Last State   #1 #2 #3   *o #2 #3 <?i  Input   *1 3l 42 <?3     The output signals, the only externally visible indication of the internal  state (the light) are described by the table   State q l q% q%  Output o o o l   This example is typical of discrete state machines. They can be described  by such tables provided they have only a finite number of possible states.  It will seem that given the initial state of the machine and the input  signals it is always possible to predict all future states. This is reminiscent  of Laplace's view that from the complete state of the universe at one  moment of time, as described by the positions and velocities of all parti  cles, it should be possible to predict all future states. The prediction which  we are considering is, however, rather nearer to practicability than that  considered by Laplace. The system of the 'universe as a whole' is such  that quite small errors in the initial conditions can have an overwhelming  effect at a later time. The displacement of a single electron by a billionth  of a centimetre at one moment might make the difference between a man  being killed by an avalanche a year later, or escaping. It is an essential  property of the mechanical systems which we have called 'discrete state  machines' that this phenomenon does not occur. Even when we consider  the actual physical machines instead of the idealised machines, reasonably  accurate knowledge of the state at one moment yields reasonably accurate  knowledge any number of steps later.     A. M. Turing  2106   As we have mentioned, digital computers fall within the class of discrete  state machines. But the number of states of which such a machine is  capable is usually enormously large. For instance, the number for the  machine now working at Manchester is about 2,, i.e., about lO-.ooo.  Compare this with our example of the clicking wheel described above,  which had three states. It is not difficult to see why the number of states  should be so immense. The computer includes a store corresponding to  the paper used by a human computer. It must be possible to write into  the store any one of the combinations of symbols which might have been  written on the paper. For simplicity suppose that only digits from to 9  are used as symbols. Variations in handwriting are ignored. Suppose the  computer is allowed 100 sheets of paper each containing 50 lines each  with room for 30 digits. Then the number of states is IQiooxsoxso, Le .,  10 i5o,ooo Th i s i s about the number of states of three Manchester machines  put together. The logarithm to the base two of the number of states is  usually called the 'storage capacity' of the machine. Thus the Manchester  machine has a storage capacity of about 165,000 and the wheel machine  of our example about 1 -6. If two machines are put together their capaci  ties must be added to obtain the capacity of the resultant machine. This  leads to the possibility of statements such as 'The Manchester machine  contains 64 magnetic tracks each with a capacity of 2560, eight electronic  tubes with a capacity of 1280. Miscellaneous storage amounts to about  300 making a total of 174,380.'   Given the table corresponding to a discrete state machine it is possible  to predict what it will do. There is no reason why this calculation should  not be carried out by means of a digital computer. Provided it could be  carried out sufficiently quickly the digital computer could mimic the  behaviour of any discrete state machine. The imitation game could then  be played with the machine in question (as B) and the mimicking digital  computer (as A) and the interrogator would be unable to distinguish  them. Of course the digital computer must have an adequate storage  capacity as well as working sufficiently fast. Moreover, it must be pro  grammed afresh for each new machine which it is desired to mimic.   This special property of digital computers, that they can mimic any  discrete state machine, is described by saying that they are universal ma  chines. The existence of machines with this property has the important  consequence that, considerations of speed apart, it is unnecessary to design  various new machines to do various computing processes. They can all  be done with one digital computer, suitably programmed for each case.  It will be seen that as a consequence of this all digital computers are in  a sense equivalent.   We may now consider again the point raised at the end of 3. It was  suggested tentatively that the question, 'Can machines think?' should be     Can a Machine TMnk? 2107   replaced by 'Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well  in the imitation game?' If we wish we can make this superficially more  general and ask 'Are there discrete state machines which would do well?'  But in view of the universality property we see that either of these ques  tions is equivalent to this, 'Let us fix our attention on one particular  digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an  adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it  with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the  part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?'   6. CONTRARY VIEWS ON THE MAIN QUESTION     We may now consider the ground to have been cleared and we are  ready to proceed to the debate on our question, 'Can machines think?'  and the variant of it quoted at the end of the last section. We cannot alto  gether abandon the original form of the problem, for opinions will differ  as to the appropriateness of the substitution and we must at least listen to  what has to be said in this connexion.   It will simplify matters for the reader if I explain first my own beliefs  in the matter. Consider first the more accurate form of the question. I  believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible to programme  computers, with a storage capacity of about 10 9 , to make them play the  imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more  than 70 per cent, chance of making the right identification after five min  utes of questioning. The original question, 'Can machines think?' I believe  to be too meaningless to deserve discussion. Nevertheless I believe that at  the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will  have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking  without expecting to be contradicted. I believe further that no useful pur  pose is served by concealing these beliefs. The popular view that scientists  proceed inexorably from well-established fact to well-established fact,  never being influenced by any unproved conjecture, is quite mistaken.  Provided it is made clear which are proved facts and which are conjec  tures, no harm can result. Conjectures are of great importance since they  suggest useful lines of research.   I now proceed to consider opinions opposed to my own.  (1) The Theological Objection. Thinking is a function of man's im  mortal soul. God has given an immortal soul to every man and woman,  but not to any other animal or to machines. Hence no animal or machine  can think. 1   1 Possibly this view is heretical. St. Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologica, quoted  by Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy, Simon and Schuster, New  York, 1945, p. 458) states that God cannot make a man to have no soul. But this may  not be a real restriction on His powers, but only a result of the fact that men's souls  are immortal, and therefore indestructible.     21Q8 A. M. Turing   I am unable to accept any part of this, but will attempt to reply in  theological terms. I should find the argument more convincing if animals  were classed with men, for there is a greater difference, to my mind, be  tween the typical animate and the inanimate than there is between man  and the other animals. The arbitrary character of the orthodox view be  comes clearer if we consider how it might appear to a member of some  other religious community. How do Christians regard the Moslem view  that women have no souls? But let us leave this point aside and return  to the main argument. It appears to me that the argument quoted above  implies a serious restriction of the omnipotence of the Almighty. It is ad  mitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one  equal to two, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a  soul on an elephant if He sees fit? We might expect that He would only  exercise this power in conjunction with a mutation which provided the  elephant with an appropriately improved brain to minister to the needs of  this soul. An argument of exactly similar form may be made for the case  of machines. It may seem different because it is more difficult to  "swallow," But this really only means that we think it would be less likely  that He would consider the circumstances suitable for conferring a soul.  The circumstances in question are discussed in the rest of this paper. In  attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently  usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the pro  creation of children : rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will  providing mansions for the souls that He creates.   However, this is mere speculation. I am not very impressed with theo  logical arguments whatever they may be used to support. Such arguments  have often been found unsatisfactory in the past. In the time of Galileo it  was argued that the texts, "And the sun stood still . . . and hasted not  to go down about a whole day" (Joshua x. 13) and "He laid the founda  tions of the earth, that it should not move at any time" (Psalm cv. 5)  were an adequate refutation of the Copernican theory. With our present  knowledge such an argument appears futile. When that knowledge was  not available it made a quite different impression.   (2) The 'Heads in the Sand' Objection. "The consequences of machines  thinking would be too dreadful. Let us hope and believe that they cannot  do so."   This argument is seldom expressed quite so openly as in the form  above. But it affects most of us who think about it at all. We like to  believe that Man is in some subtle way superior to the rest of creation. It  is best if he can be shown to be necessarily superior, for then there is no  danger of him losing his commanding position. The popularity of the theo  logical argument is clearly connected with this feeling. It is likely to be  quite strong in intellectual people, since they value the power of thinking     Can a Machine Think? 2109   more highly than others, and are more inclined to base their belief in the  superiority of Man on this power.   1 do not think that this argument is sufficiently substantial to require  refutation. Consolation would be more appropriate: perhaps this should be  sought in the transmigration of souls.   (3) The Mathematical Objection. There are a number of results of  mathematical logic which can be used to show that there are limitations  to the powers of discrete-state machines. The best known of these results  is known as Godel's theorem, and shows that in any sufficiently power  ful logical system statements can be formulated which can neither be  proved nor disproved within the system, unless possibly the system itself  is inconsistent. There are other, in some respects similar, results due to  Church, 2 Kleene, Rosser, and Turing. The latter result is the most con  venient to consider, since it refers directly to machines, whereas the others  can only be used in a comparatively indirect argument: for instance if  Godel's theorem is to be used we need in addition to have some means of  describing logical systems in terms of machines, and machines in terms  of logical systems. The result in question refers to a type of machine  which is essentially a digital computer with an infinite capacity. It states  that there are certain things that such a machine cannot do. If it is rigged  up to give answers to questions as in the imitation game, there will be  some questions to which it will either give a wrong answer, or fail to give  an answer at all however much time is allowed for a reply. There may,  of course, be many such questions, and questions which cannot be an  swered by one machine may be satisfactorily answered by another. We are  of course supposing for the present that the questions are of the kind to  which an answer 'Yes' or 'No' is appropriate, rather than questions such  as What do you think of Picasso?' The questions that we know the ma  chines must fail on are of this type, "Consider the machine specified as  follows. . . . Will this machine ever answer 'Yes' to any question?" The  dots are to be replaced by a description of some machine in a standard  form, which could be something like that used in 5. When the machine  described bears a certain comparatively simple relation to the machine  which is under interrogation, it can be shown that the answer is either  wrong or not forthcoming. This is the mathematical result: it is argued  that it proves a disability of machines to which the human intellect is not  subject.   The short answer to this argument is that although it is established that  there are limitations to the powers of any particular machine, it has only  been stated, without any sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to  the human intellect. But I do not think this view can be dismissed quite  so lightly. Whenever one of these machines is asked the appropriate criti-   2 Authors' names in italics refer to the Bibliography. (See end of this article.)     2no A. M. Turing   cal question, and gives a definite answer, we know that this answer must  be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this feeling  illusory? It is no doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much impor  tance should be attached to it. We too often give wrong answers to ques  tions ourselves to be justified in being very pleased at such evidence of  fallibility on the part of the machines. Further, our superiority can only  be felt on such an occasion in relation to the one machine over which  we have scored our petty triumph. There would be no question of triumph  ing simultaneously over all machines. In short, then, there might be men  cleverer than any given machine, but then again there might be other  machines cleverer again, and so on.   Those who hold to the mathematical argument would, I think, mostly  be willing to accept the imitation game as a basis for discussion. Those  who believe in the two previous objections would probably not be inter  ested in any criteria.   (4) The Argument from Consciousness. This argument is very well  expressed in Professor Jefferson's Lister Oration for 1949, from which I  quote. "Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto  because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of sym  bols, could we agree that machine equals brain that is, not only write it  but know that it had written it. No mechanism could feel (and not merely  artificially signal, an easy contrivance) pleasure at its successes, grief when  its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made miserable by its mistakes,  be charmed by sex, be angry or depressed when it cannot get what it  wants."   This argument appears to be a denial of the validity of our test. Accord  ing to the most extreme form of this view the only way by which one  could be sure that a machine thinks is to be the machine and to feel one  self thinking. One could then describe these feelings to the world, but,  of course no one would be justified in taking any notice. Likewise accord  ing to this view the only way to know that a man thinks is to be that  particular man. It is in fact the solipsist point of view. It may be the most  logical view to hold but it makes communication of ideas difficult. A is  liable to believe 'A thinks but B does not' whilst B believes 'B thinks but  A does not.' Instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to  have the polite convention that everyone thinks.   I am sure that Professor Jefferson does not wish to adopt the extreme  and solipsist point of view. Probably he would be quite willing to accept  the imitation game as a test. The game (with the player B omitted) is  frequently used in practice under the name of viva voce to discover  whether some one really understands something or has 'learnt it parrot  fashion.' Let us listen in to a part of such a viva voce:   Interrogator: In the first line of your sonnet which reads 'Shall I com-     Can a Machine Think? 2111   pare thee to a summer's day,' would not 'a spring day' do as well or  better?   Witness: It wouldn't scan.   Interrogator: How about 'a winter's day.' That would scan all right.   Witness: Yes, but nobody wants to be compared to a winter's day.   Interrogator: Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas?   Witness: In away.   Interrogator: Yet Christmas is a winter's day, and I do not think Mr.  Pickwick would mind the comparison.   Witness: I don't think you're serious. By a winter's day one means a  typical winter's day, rather than a special one like Christmas.   And so on. What would Professor Jefferson say if the sonnet-writing  machine was able to answer like this in the viva vocel I do not know  whether he would regard the machine as 'merely artificially signalling'  these answers, but if the answers were as satisfactory and sustained as in  the above passage I do not think he would describe it as 'an easy con  trivance.' This phrase is, I think, intended to cover such devices as the  inclusion in the machine of a record of someone reading a sonnet, with  appropriate switching to turn it on from time to time.   In short then, I think that most of those who support the argument  from consciousness could be persuaded to abandon it rather than be  forced into the solipsist position. They will then probably be willing to  accept our test.   I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery  about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of a paradox con  nected with any attempt to localise it. But I do not think these mysteries  necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with  which we are concerned in this paper.   (5) Arguments from Various Disabilities. These arguments take the  form, "I grant you that you can make machines do all the things you  have mentioned but you will never be able to make one to do X." Nu  merous features X are suggested in this connexion. I offer a selection:   Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly (p. 2112), have initiative, have  a sense of humour, tell right from wrong, make mistakes (p. 2112), fall in  love, enjoy strawberries and cream (p. 2112), make some one fall in love  with it, learn from experience (pp. 2119 f.), use words properly, be the  subject of its own thought (p. 2113), have as much diversity of behaviour  as a man, do something really new (p. 2114). (Some of these disabilities  are given special consideration as indicated by the page numbers.)   No support is usually offered for these statements. I believe they are  mostly founded on the principle of scientific induction. A man has seen     2m A. M. Turing   thousands of machines in his lifetime. From what he sees of them he  draws a number of general conclusions. They are ugly, each is designed  for a very limited purpose, when required for a minutely different purpose  they are useless, the variety of behaviour of any one of them is very small,  etc., etc. Naturally he concludes that these are necessary properties of  machines in general. Many of these limitations are associated with the  very small storage capacity of most machines. (I am assuming that the  idea of storage capacity is extended in some way to cover machines other  than discrete-state machines. The exact definition does not matter as no  mathematical accuracy is claimed in the present discussion.) A few years  ago, when very little had been heard of digital computers, it was possible  to elicit much incredulity concerning them, if one mentioned their prop  erties without describing their construction. That was presumably due to a  similar application of the principle of scientific induction. These applica  tions of the principle are of course largely unconscious. When a burnt  child fears the fire and shows that he fears it by avoiding it, I should say  that he was applying scientific induction. (I could of course also describe  his behaviour in many other ways.) The works and customs of mankind  do not seem to be very suitable material to which to apply scientific induc  tion. A very large part of space-time must be investigated, if reliable  results are to be obtained. Otherwise we may (as most English children  do) decide that everybody speaks English, and that it is silly to learn  French.   There are, however, special remarks to be made about many of the dis  abilities that have been mentioned. The inability to enjoy strawberries and  cream may have struck the reader as frivolous. Possibly a machine might  be made to enjoy this delicious dish, but any attempt to make one do so  would be idiotic. What is important about this disability is that it con  tributes to some of the other disabilities, e.g., to the difficulty of the same  kind of friendliness occurring between man and machine as between white  man and white man, or between black man and black man.   The claim that "machines cannot make mistakes" seems a curious one.  One is tempted to retort, "Are they any the worse for that?" But let us  adopt a more sympathetic attitude, and try to see what is really meant.  I think this criticism can be explained in terms of the imitation game. It  is claimed that the interrogator could distinguish the machine from the  man simply by setting them a number of problems in arithmetic. The  machine would be unmasked because of its deadly accuracy. The reply to  this is simple. The machine (programmed for playing the game) would  not attempt to give the right answers to the arithmetic problems. It would  deliberately introduce mistakes in a manner calculated to confuse the in  terrogator. A mechanical fault would probably show itself through an  unsuitable decision as to what sort of a mistake to make in the arithmetic.     Can a Machine Think? 2113   Even this interpretation of the criticism is not sufficiently sympathetic.  But we cannot afford the space to go into it much further. It seems to me  that this criticism depends on a confusion between two kinds of mistake.  We may call them 'errors of functioning' and 'errors of conclusion.' Errors  of functioning are due to some mechanical or electrical fault which causes  the machine to behave otherwise than it was designed to do. In philo  sophical discussions one likes to ignore the possibility of such errors; one is  therefore discussing 'abstract machines.' These abstract machines are  mathematical fictions rather than physical objects. By definition they are  incapable of errors of functioning. In this sense we can truly say that 'ma  chines can never make mistakes.' Errors of conclusion can only arise when  some meaning is attached to the output signals from the machine. The  machine might, for instance, type out mathematical equations, or sen  tences in English. When a false proposition is typed we say that the ma  chine has committed an error of conclusion. There is clearly no reason  at all for saying that a machine cannot make this kind of mistake. It  might do nothing but type out repeatedly '0 = 1 .' To take a less perverse  example, it might have some method for drawing conclusions by scientific  induction. We must expect such a method to lead occasionally to erroneous  results.   The claim that a machine cannot be the subject of its own thought can  of course only be answered if it can be shown that the machine has some  thought with some subject matter. Nevertheless, 'the subject matter of a  machine's operations' does seem to mean something, at least to the people  who deal with it. If, for instance, the machine was trying to find a solu  tion of the equation x 2 40;t 11=0 one would be tempted to describe  this equation as part of the machine's subject matter at that moment. In  this sort of sense a machine undoubtedly can be its own subject matter.  It may be used to help in making up its own programmes, or to predict  the effect of alterations in its own structure. By observing the results of  its own behaviour it can modify its own programmes so as to achieve  some purpose more effectively. These are possibilities of the near future,  rather than Utopian dreams.   The criticism that a machine cannot have much diversity of behaviour  is just a way of saying that it cannot have much storage capacity. Until  fairly recently a storage capacity of even a thousand digits was very rare.   The criticisms that we are considering here are often disguised forms  of the argument from consciousness. Usually if one maintains that a ma  chine can do one of these things, and describes the kind of method that  the machine could use, one will not make much of an impression. It is  thought that the method (whatever it may be, for it must be mechanical)  is really rather base. Compare the parenthesis in Jefferson's statement  quoted on p. 2110.     A. M. Turing  2114   (6) Lady Lovelace's Objection. Our most detailed information of Bab-  bage's Analytical Engine comes from a memoir by Lady Lovelace. In it  she states, The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate any  thing It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform (her  italics). This statement is quoted by Bartree who adds: "This does not  imply that it may not be possible to construct electronic equipment  which will 'think for itself,' or in which, in biological terms, one could  set up a conditioned reflex, which would serve as a basis for learn  ing' Whether this is possible in principle or not is a stimulating and ex  citing question, suggested by some of these recent developments. But it  did not seem that the machines constructed or projected at the time had   this property."   I am in thorough agreement with Hartree over this. It will be noticed  that he does not assert that the machines in question had not got the prop  erty but rather that the evidence available to Lady Lovelace did not en  courage her to believe that they had it. It is quite possible that the  machines in question had in a sense got this property. For suppose that  some discrete-state machine has the property. The Analytical Engine was  a universal digital computer, so that, if its storage capacity and speed were  adequate, it could by suitable programming be made to mimic the machine  in question. Probably this argument did not occur to the Countess or to  Babbage. In any case there was no obligation on them to claim all that  could be claimed,   This whole question will be considered again under the heading of   learning machines.   A variant of Lady Lovelace's objection states that a machine can 'never  do anything really new.' This may be parried for a moment with the saw,  There is nothing new under the sun.' Who can be certain that 'original  work' that he has done was not simply the growth of the seed planted in  him by teaching, or the effect of following well-known general principles.  A better variant of the objection says that a machine can never 'take us  by surprise.' This statement is a more direct challenge and can be met  directly. Machines take me by surprise with great frequency. This is  largely because I do not do sufficient calculation to decide what to expect  them to do, or rather because, although I do a calculation, I do it in a  hurried, slipshod fashion, taking risks. Perhaps I say to myself, 1 suppose  the voltage here ought to be the same as there: anyway let's assume it is.'  Naturally I am often wrong, and the result is a surprise for me for by the  time the experiment is done these assumptions have been forgotten. These  admissions lay me open to lectures on the subject of my vicious ways, but  do not throw any doubt on my credibility when I testify to the surprises I   experience.   I do not expect this reply to silence my critic. He will probably say that     Can a Machine Think? 2115   such surprises are due to some creative mental act on my part, and reflect  no credit on the machine. This leads us back to the argument from con  sciousness, and far from the idea of surprise. It is a line of argument we  must consider closed, but it is perhaps worth remarking that the appre  ciation of something as surprising requires as much of a 'creative mental  act' whether the surprising event originates from a man, a book, a machine  or anything else.   The view that machines cannot give rise to surprises is due, I believe,  to a fallacy to which philosophers and mathematicians are particularly  subject. This is the assumption that as soon as a fact is presented to a  mind all consequences of that fact spring into the mind simultaneously  with it. It is a very useful assumption under many circumstances, but one  too easily forgets that it is false. A natural consequence of doing so is that  one then assumes that there is no virtue in the mere working out of con  sequences from data and general principles.   (7) Argument from Continuity in the Nervous System. The nervous  system is certainly not a discrete-state machine. A small error in the in  formation about the size of a nervous impulse impinging on a neuron,  may make a large difference to the size of the outgoing impulse. It may  be argued that, this being so, one cannot expect to be able to mimic the  behaviour of the nervous system with a discrete-state system.   It is true that a discrete-state machine must be different from a continu  ous machine. But if we adhere to the conditions of the imitation game,  the interrogator will not be able to take any advantage of this difference.  The situation can be made clearer if we consider some other simpler con  tinuous machine. A differential analyser will do very well. (A differential  analyser is a certain kind of machine not of the discrete-state type used  for some kinds of calculation.) Some of these provide their answers in a  typed form, and so are suitable for taking part in the game. It would not  be possible for a digital computer to predict exactly what answers the  differential analyser would give to a problem, but it would be quite capable  of giving the right sort of answer. For instance, if asked to give the value  of TT (actually about 3-1416) it would be reasonable to choose at random  between the values 3 - 12, 3 13, 3 - 14, 3 15, 3 16 with the probabilities of  0-05, 0-15, 0-55, 0-19, 0-06 (say). Under these circumstances it would  be very difficult for the interrogator to distinguish the differential analyser  from the digital computer.   (8) The Argument from Informality of Behaviour. It is not possible to  produce a set of rules purporting to describe what a man should do in  every conceivable set of circumstances. One might for instance have a rule  that one is to stop when one sees a red traffic light, and to go if one sees  a green one, but what if by some fault both appear together? One may  perhaps decide that it is safest to stop. But some further difficulty may     2U6 A. M. Turing   well arise from this decision later. To attempt to provide rules of conduct  to cover every eventuality, even those arising from traffic lights, appears  to be impossible. With all this I agree.   From this it is argued that we cannot be machines. I shall try to repro  duce the argument, but I fear I shall hardly do it justice. It seems to run  something like this. If each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by  which he regulated his life he would be no better than a machine. But  there are no such rules, so men cannot be machines.' The undistributed  middle is glaring. I do not think the argument is ever put quite like this,  but I believe this is the argument used nevertheless. There may however  be a certain confusion between 'rules of conduct* and 'laws of behaviour'  to cloud the issue. By 'rules of conduct' I mean precepts such as 'Stop if  you see red lights,' on which one can act, and of which one can be con  scious. By 'laws of behaviour' I mean laws of nature as applied to a man's  body such as 'if you pinch him he will squeak.' If we substitute 'laws of  behaviour which regulate his life' for laws of conduct by which he regu  lates his life' in the argument quoted the undistributed middle is no longer  insuperable. For we believe that it is not only true that being regulated by  laws of behaviour implies being some sort of machine (though not neces  sarily a discrete-state machine) , but that conversely being such a machine  implies being regulated by such laws. However, we cannot so easily con  vince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour as of com  plete rules of conduct. The only way we know of for finding such laws is  scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under  which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'   We can demonstrate more forcibly that any such statement would be  unjustified. For suppose we could be sure of finding such laws if they  existed. Then given a discrete-state machine it should certainly be possible  to discover by observation sufficient about it to predict its future be  haviour, and this within a reasonable time, say a thousand years. But this  does not seem to be the case. I have set up on the Manchester computer  a small programme using only 1000 units of storage, whereby the machine  supplied with one sixteen figure number replies with another within two  seconds. I would defy anyone to learn from these replies sufficient about  the programme to be able to predict any replies to untried values.   (9) The Argument from Extra-Sensory Perception. I assume that the  reader is familiar with the idea of extra-sensory perception, and the mean  ing of the four items of it, viz. telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and  psycho-kinesis. These disturbing phenomena seem to deny all our usual  scientific ideas. How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately the  statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming. It is very diffi  cult to rearrange one's ideas so as to fit these new facts in. Once one has  accepted them it does not seem a very big step to believe in ghosts and     Can a Machine Think? 2117   bogies. The idea that our bodies move simply according to the known  laws of physics, together with some others not yet discovered but some  what similar, would be one of the first to go.   This argument is to my mind quite a strong one. One can say in reply  that many scientific theories seem to remain workable in practice, in spite  of clashing with E.S.P.; that in fact one can get along very nicely if one  forgets about it. This is rather cold comfort, and one fears that thinking  is just the kind of phenomenon where E.S.P. may be especially relevant.   A more specific argument based on E.S.P. might run as follows: "Let  us play the imitation game, using as witnesses a man who is good as a  telepathic receiver, and a digital computer. The interrogator can ask such  questions as 'What suit does the card in my right hand belong to?' The  man by telepathy or clairvoyance gives the right answer 130 times out of  400 cards. The machine can only guess at random, and perhaps gets 104  right, so the interrogator makes the right identification." There is an in  teresting possibility which opens here. Suppose the digital computer con  tains a random number generator. Then it will be natural to use this to  decide what answer to give. But then the random number generator will  be subject to the psycho-kinetic powers of the interrogator. Perhaps this  psycho-kinesis might cause the machine to guess right more often than  would be expected on a probability calculation, so that the interrogator  might still be unable to make the right identification. On the other hand,  he might be able to guess right without any questioning, by clairvoyance.  With E.S.P. anything may happen.   If telepathy is admitted it will be necessary to tighten our test up. The  situation could be regarded as analogous to that which would occur if the  interrogator were talking to himself and one of the competitors was listen  ing with his ear to the wall. To put the competitors into a 'telepathy-proof  room' would satisfy all requirements.   7. LEARNING MACHINES   The reader will have anticipated that I have no very convincing argu  ments of a positive tiature to support my views. If I had I should not have  taken such pains to point out the fallacies in contrary views. Such evi  dence as I have I shall now give.   Let us return for a moment to Lady Lovelace's objection, which stated  that the machine can only do what we tell it to do. One could say that a  man can 'inject' an idea into the machine, and that it will respond to a  certain extent and then drop into quiescence, like a piano string struck by  a hammer. Another simile would be an atomic pile of less than critical  size: an injected idea is to correspond to a neutron entering the pile from  without. Each such neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventu  ally dies away. If, however, the size of the pile is sufficiently increased, the     2H8 A. M.Turin,   disturbance caused by such an incoming neutron will very likely go on  and on increasing until the whole pile is destroyed. Is there a correspond  ing phenomenon for minds, and is there one for machines? There does  seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to be  'sub-critical,' i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of subcritical size.  An idea presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one  idea in reply. A smallish proportion are super-critical. An idea presented  to such a mind may give rise to a whole 'theory' consisting of secondary,  tertiary and more remote ideas. Animals minds seem to be very definitely  sub-critical. Adhering to this analogy we ask, 'Can a machine be made to  be super-critical?'   The 'skin of an onion' analogy is also helpful. In considering the func  tions of the mind or the brain we find certain operations which we can  explain in purely mechanical terms. This we say does not correspond to  the real mind: it is a sort of skin which we must strip off if we are to find  the real mind. But then in what remains we find a further skin to be  stripped off, and so on. Proceeding in this way do we ever come to the  'real' mind, or do we eventually come to the skin which has nothing in it?  In the latter case the whole mind is mechanical. (It would not be a dis  crete-state machine however. We have discussed this.)   These last two paragraphs do not claim to be convincing arguments.  They should rattier be described as 'recitations tending to produce belief.'   The only really satisfactory support that can be given for the view ex  pressed at the beginning of Sec. 6, p. 2107, will be that provided by waiting  for the end of the century and then doing the experiment described. But  what can we say in the meantime? What steps should be taken now if the  experiment is to be successful?   As I have explained, the problem is mainly one of programming. Ad  vances in engineering will have to be made too, but it seems unlikely that  these will not be adequate for the requirements. Estimates of the storage  capacity of the brain vary from 10 10 to 10 15 binary digits. I incline to  the lower values and believe that only a very small fraction is used for the  higher types of thinking. Most of it is probably used for the retention of  visual impressions. I should be surprised if more than 10 9 was required  for satisfactory playing of the imitation game, at any rate against a blind  man. (Note The capacity of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, llth edition,  is 2 X 10 9 .) A storage capacity of 10 7 would be a very practicable possi  bility even by present techniques. It is probably not necessary to increase  the speed of operations of the machines at all. Parts of modern machines  which can be regarded as analogues of nerve cells work about a thousand  times faster than the latter. This should provide a 'margin of safety' which  could cover losses of speed arising in many ways. Our problem then is to  find out how to programme these machines to play the game. At my     Can a Machine Think? 2119   present rate of working I produce about a thousand digits of programme  a day, so that about sixty workers, working steadily through the fifty  years might accomplish the job, if nothing went into the waste-paper  basket. Some more expeditious method seems desirable.   In the process of trying to imitate an adult human mind we are bound  to think a good deal about the process which has brought it to the state  that it is in. We may notice three components,   (a) The initial state of the mind, say at birth,   (b) The education to which it has been subjected,   (c) Other experience, not to be described as education, to which it has  been subjected.   Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind,  why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child's? If this were  then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain -the  adult brain. Presumably the child-brain is something like a note-book as  one buys it from the stationers. Rather little mechanism, and lots of blank  sheets. (Mechanism and writing are from our point of view almost synony  mous.) Our hope is that there is so little mechanism in the child-brain  that something like it can be easily programmed. The amount of work in  the education we can assume, as a first approximation, to be much the  same as for the human child.   We have thus divided our problem into two parts. The child-programme  and the education process. These two remain very closely connected. We  cannot expect to find a good child-machine at the first attempt. One must  experiment with teaching one such machine and see how well it learns.  One can then try another and see if it is better or worse. There is an  obvious connection between this process and evolution, by the identifi  cations   Structure of the child machine = Hereditary material   Changes " " " " = Mutations   Natural selection = Judgment of the experimenter   One may hope, however, that this process will be more expeditious than  evolution. The survival of the fittest is a slow method for measuring ad  vantages. The experimenter, by the exercise of intelligence, should be able  to speed it up. Equally important is the fact that he is not restricted to  random mutations. If he can trace a cause for some weakness he can  probably think of the kind of mutation which will improve it.   It will not be possible to apply exactly the same teaching process to the  machine as to a normal child. It will not, for instance, be provided with  legs, so that it could not be asked to go out and fill the coal scuttle. Pos  sibly it might not have eyes. But however well these deficiencies might be  overcome by clever engineering, one could not send the creature to school     2i20 A. M. Turin*   without the other children making excessive fun of it. It must be given  some tuition. We need not be too concerned about the legs, eyes, etc. The  example of Miss Helen Keller shows that education can take place pro  vided that communication in both directions between teacher and pupil  can take place by some means or other.   We normally associate punishments and rewards with the teaching  process. Some simple child-machines can be constructed or programmed  on this sort of principle. The machine has to be so constructed that events  which shortly preceded the occurrence of a punishment-signal are unlikely  to be repeated, whereas a reward-signal increased the probability of repe-  tion of the events which led up to it. These definitions do not presuppose  any feelings on the part of the machine. I have done some experiments  with one such child-machine, and succeeded in teaching it a few things,  but -the teaching method was too unorthodox for the experiment to be  considered really successful.   The use of punishments and rewards can at best be a part of the teach  ing process. Roughly speaking, if the teacher has no other means of com  municating to the pupil, the amount of information which can reach him  does not exceed the total number of rewards and punishments applied.  By the time a child has learnt to repeat 'Casabianca' he would probably  feel very sore indeed, if the text could only be discovered by a Twenty  Questions' technique, every 'NO' taking the form of a blow. It is necessary  therefore to have some other 'unemotional' channels of communication.  If these are available it is possible to teach a machine by punishments and  rewards to obey orders given in some language, e.g., a symbolic language.  These orders are to be transmitted through the 'unemotional' channels.  The use of this language will diminish greatly the number of punishments  and rewards required.   Opinions may vary as to the complexity which is suitable in the child  machine. One might try to make it as simple as possible consistently with  the general principles. Alternatively one might have a complete system of  logical inference 'built in.' 3 In the latter case the store would be largely  occupied with definitions and propositions. The propositions would have  various kinds of status, e.g., well-established facts, conjectures, mathemati  cally proved theorems, statements given by an authority, expressions  having the logical form of proposition but not belief-value. Certain propo  sitions may be described as 'imperatives.' The machine should be so con  structed that as soon as an imperative is classed as 'well-established' the  appropriate action automatically takes place. To illustrate this, suppose  the teacher says to the machine, 'Do your homework now.' This may cause  "Teacher says 'Do your homework now' " to be included amongst the well-   3 Or rather 'programmed in' for our child machine will be programmed in a digital  computer. But the logical system will not have to be learnt.     Can a Machine Think? 2121   established facts. Another such fact might be, "Everything that teacher  says is true." Combining these may eventually lead to the imperative, c Do  your homework now,' being included amongst the well-established facts,  and this, by the construction of the machine, will mean that the homework  actually gets started, but the effect is very satisfactory. The processes of  inference used by the machine need not be such as would satisfy the most  exacting logicians. There might for instance be no hierarchy of types.  But this need not mean that type fallacies will occur, any more than we  are bound to fall over unfenced cliffs. Suitable imperatives (expressed  within the systems, not forming part of the rules of the system) such  as 'Do not use a class unless it is a subclass of one which has been men  tioned by teacher' can have a similar effect to 'Do not go too near the  edge.'   The imperatives that can be obeyed by a machine that has no limbs are  bound to be of a rather intellectual character, as in the example (doing  homework) given above. Important amongst such imperatives will be  ones which regulate the order in which the rules of the logical system  concerned are to be applied. For at each stage when one is using a logical  system, there is a very large number of alternative steps, any of which one  is permitted to apply, so far as obedience to the rules of the logical system  is concerned. These choices make the difference between a brilliant and a  footling reasoner, not the difference between a sound and a fallacious one.  Propositions leading to imperatives of this kind might be "When Socrates  is mentioned, use the syllogism in Barbara" or "If one method has been  proved to be quicker than another, do not use the slower method." Some  of these may be 'given by authority,* but others may be produced by the  machine itself, e.g., by scientific induction.   The idea of a learning machine may appear paradoxical to some  readers. How can the rules of operation of the machine change? They  should describe completely how the machine will react whatever its his  tory might be, whatever changes it might undergo. The rules are thus  quite time-invariant. This is quite true. The explanation of the paradox  is that the rules which get changed in the learning process are of a rather  less pretentious kind, claiming only an ephemeral validity. The reader  may draw a parallel with the Constitution of the United States.   An important feature of a learning machine is that its teacher will often  be very largely ignorant of quite what is going on inside, although he may  still be able to some extent to predict his pupil's behaviour. This should  apply most strongly to the later education of a machine arising from a  child-machine of well-tried design (or programme) . This is in clear con  trast with normal procedure when using a machine to do computations:  one's object is then to have a clear mental picture of the state of the  machine at each moment in the computation. This object can only be     A. M. Turing  2122   achieved with a struggle. The view that 'the machine can only do what we  know how to order it to do,' * appears strange in face of this. Most of the  programmes which we can put into the machine will result in its doing  something that we cannot make sense of at all, or which we regard as  completely random behaviour. Intelligent behaviour presumably consists  in a departure from the completely disciplined behaviour involved in com  putation, but a rather slight one, which does not give rise to random  behaviour, or to pointless repetitive loops. Another important result of  preparing our machine for its part in the imitation game by a process of  teaching and learning is that 'human fallibility is likely to be omitted ma  rather natural way, i.e., without special 'coaching.' (The reader should  reconcile this with the point of view on pp. 2111-12.) Processes that are  learnt do not produce a hundred per cent, certainty of result; if they did  they could not be unlearnt.   It is probably wise to include a random element in a learning machine  (see p 2104). A random element is rather useful when we are searching  for a solution of some problem. Suppose for instance we wanted to find  a number between 50 and 200 which was equal to the square of the sum  of its digits, we might start at 51 then try 52 and go on until we got a  number that worked. Alternatively we might choose numbers at random  until we got a good one. This method has the advantage that it is unneces  sary to keep track of the values that have been tried, but the disadvantage  that one may try the same one twice, but this is not very important if  there are several solutions. The systematic method has the disadvantage  that there may be an enormous block without any solutions in the region,  which has to be investigated first. Now the learning process may be re  garded as a search for a form of behaviour which .will satisfy the teacher  (or some other criterion). Since there is probably a very large number of  satisfactory solutions the random method seems to be better than the sys  tematic. It should be noticed that it is used in the analogous process of  evolution. But there the systematic method is not possible. How could  one keep track of the different genetical combinations that had been  tried, so as to avoid trying them again?   We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all  purely intellectual fields. But which are the best ones to start with? Even  this is a difficult decision. Many people think that a very abstract activity,  like the playing of chess, would be best. It can also be maintained that it  is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can  buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. This process  could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out   4 Compare Lady Lovelace's statement (p. 2114), which does not contain the word  'only. 1     Can a Machine Think?   and named, etc. Again I do not know what the right answer is, but I think  both approaches should be tried.   We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there  that needs to be done.   BIBLIOGRAPHY   Samuel Butler, Erewhon, London, 1865. Chapters 23, 24, 25, The Book   of the Machines.

SHANNON   FOR centuries philosophers and scientists have speculated about whether  or not the human brain is essentially a machine. Could a machine be de  signed that would be capable of "thinking"? During the past decade sev  eral large-scale electronic computing machines have been constructed  which are capable of something very close to the reasoning process. These  new computers were designed primarily to carry out purely numerical  calculations. They perform automaticaUy a long sequence of additions,  multiplications and other arithmetic operations at a rate of thousands per  second. The basic design of these machines is so general and flexible, how  ever, that they can be adapted to work symbolically with elements repre  senting words, propositions or other conceptual entities.   One such possibility, which is already being investigated in several quar  ters, is that of translating from one language to another by means of a  computer. The immediate goal is not a finished literary rendition, but only  a word-by-word translation that would convey enough of the meaning to  be understandable. Computing machines could also be employed for many  other tasks of a semi-rote, semi-thinking character, such as designing elec  trical filters and relay circuits, helping to regulate airplane traffic at busy  airports, and routing long-distance telephone calls most efficiently over a  limited number of trunks.   Some of the possibilities in this direction can be illustrated by setting up  a computer in such a way that it will play a fair game of chess. This  problem, of course, is of no importance in itself, but it was undertaken  with a serious purpose in mind. The investigation of the chess-playing  problem is intended to develop techniques that can be used for more prac  tical applications.   The chess machine is an ideal one to start with for several reasons. The  problem is sharply defined, both in the allowed operations (the moves of  chess) and in the ultimate goal (checkmate). It is neither so simple as to  be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution. And such a machine  could be pitted against a human opponent, giving a clear measure of the  machine's ability in this type of reasoning.     2124     A Chess-Playing Machine 2125   There is already a considerable literature on the subject of chess-playing  machines. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries a Hungarian in  ventor named Wolfgang von Kempelen astounded Europe with a device  known as the Maelzel Chess Automaton, which toured the Continent to  large audiences. A number of papers purporting to explain its operation,  including an analytical essay by Edgar Allan Poe, soon appeared. Most of  the analysts concluded, quite correctly, that the automaton was operated  by a human chess master concealed inside. Some years later the exact  manner of operation was exposed (see Figure 1).      FIGURE 1 Chess machine of the 18th century was actually run by man inside.   A more honest attempt to design a chess-playing machine was made in  1914 by a Spanish inventor named L. Torres y Quevedo, who constructed  a device that played an end game of king and rook against king. The  machine, playing the side with king and rook, would force checkmate in  a few moves however its human opponent played. Since an explicit set of  rules can be given for making satisfactory moves in such an end game,  the problem is relatively simple, but the idea was quite advanced for that  period.   An electronic computer can be set up to play a complete game. In order  to explain the actual setup of a chess machine, it may be best to start with  a general picture of a computer and its operation.   A general-purpose electronic computer is an extremely complicated de  vice containing several thousand vacuum tubes, relays and other elements.  The basic principles involved, however, are quite simple. The machine has  four main parts: (1) an "arithmetic organ," (2) a control element, (3) a  numerical memory and (4) a program memory. (In some designs the two  memory functions are carried out in the same physical apparatus.) The  manner of operation is exactly analogous to a human computer carrying     Claude E. Shannon  2126   out a series of numerical calculations with an ordinary desk computing  machine. The arithmetic organ corresponds to the desk computing ma  chine the control element to the human operator, the numerical memory  to the work sheet on which intermediate and final results are recorded,  and the program memory to the computing routine describing the series of  operations to be performed.   In an electronic computing machine, the numerical memory consists of  a large number of "boxes," each capable of holding a number. To set up  a problem on the computer, it is necessary to assign box numbers to all  numerical quantities involved, and then to construct a program telling the  machine what arithmetical operations must be performed on the numbers  and where the results should go. The program consists of a sequence of  "orders," each describing an elementary calculation. For example, a typi  cal order may read A 372, 451, 133. This means: add the number stored  in box 372 to that in box 451, and put the sum in box 133. Another type  of order requires the machine to make a decision. For example, the order  C 291, 118, 345 tells the machine to compare the contents of boxes 291  and 118; if' the number in box 291 is larger, the machine goes on to the  next order in the program; if not, it takes its next order from box 345.  This type of order enables the machine to choose from alternative proce  dures, depending on the results of previous calculations. The "vocabulary"  of an electronic computer may include as many as 30 different types of   orders.   After the machine is provided with a program, the initial numbers re  quired for the calculation are placed in the numerical memory and the  machine then automatically carries out the computation. Of course such  a machine is most useful in problems involving an enormous number of  individual calculations, which would be too laborious to carry out by  hand.   The problem of setting up a computer for playing chess can be divided  into three parts: first, a code must be chosen so that chess positions and  the chess pieces can be represented as numbers; second, a strategy must be  found for choosing the moves to be made; and third, this strategy must be  translated into a sequence of elementary computer orders, or a program.   A suitable code for the chessboard and the chess pieces is shown in  Figure 2. Each square on the board has a number consisting of two digits,  the first digit corresponding to the "rank" or horizontal row, the second  to the "file" or vertical row. Each different chess piece also is designated  by a number: a pawn is numbered 1, a knight 2, a bishop 3, a rook 4 and  so on. White pieces are represented by positive numbers and black pieces  by negative ones. The positions of all the pieces on the board can be  shown by a sequence of 64 numbers, with zeros to indicate the empty     A Chess-Playing Machine     2127      1     FIGURE 2 Code for a chess-playing machine is plotted on a chessboard. Each square can be  designated by two digits, one representing the horizontal row and the other the verti  cal. Pieces also are coded in numbers.   squares. Thus any chess position can be recorded as a series of numbers  and stored in the numerical memory of a computing machine.   A chess move is specified by giving the number of the square on which  the piece stands and of the one to which it is moved. Ordinarily two  numbers would be sufficient to describe a move, but to take care of the  special case of the promotion of a pawn to a higher piece a third number  is necessary. This number indicates the piece to which the pawn is con  verted. In all other moves the third number is zero. Thus a knight move  from square 01 to 22 is encoded into 01, 22, 0. The move of a pawn from  62 to 72, and its promotion to a queen, is represented by 62, 72, 5.   The second main problem is that of deciding on a strategy of play. A  straightforward process must be found for calculating a reasonably good  move for any given chess position. This is the most difficult part of the  problem. The program designer can employ here the principles of correct  play that have been evolved by expert chess players. These empirical  principles are a means of bringing some order to the maze of possible  variations of a chess game. Even the high speeds available in electronic  computers are hopelessly inadequate to play perfect chess by calculating  all possible variations to the end of the game. In a typical chess position  there will be about 32 possible moves with 32 possible replies already  this creates 1,024 possibilities. Most chess games last 40 moves or more  for each side. So the total number of possible variations in an average  game is about 10 120 . A machine calculating one variation each millionth  of a second would require over 10 95 years to decide on its first move!     Claude E, Shannon  2128   Other methods of attempting to play perfect chess seem equally Im  practicable; we resign ourselves, therefore, to having the machine play a  reasonably skillful game, admitting occasional moves that may not be the  best. This, of course, is precisely what human players do: no one plays a   perfect game.   In setting up a strategy on the machine one must establish a method of  numerical evaluation for any given chess position. A chess player looking  at a position can form an estimate as to which side, White or Black, has  the advantage. Furthermore, his evaluation is roughly quantitative. He  may say, "White has a rook for a bishop, an advantage of about two  pawns"; or "Black has sufficient mobility to compensate for a sacrificed  pawn." These judgments are based on long experience and are summarized  in the principles of chess expounded in chess literature. For example, it  has been found that a queen is worth nine pawns, a rook is worth five,  and a bishop or a knight is worth about three. As a first rough approxima  tion, a position can be evaluated by merely adding up the total forces for  each side, measured in terms of the pawn unit. There are, however, numer  ous other features which must be taken into account: the mobility and  placement of pieces, the weakness of king protection, the nature of the  pawn formation, and so on, These too can be given numerical weights  and combined in the evaluation, and it is here that the knowledge and  experience of chess masters must be enlisted.   Assuming that a suitable method of position evaluation has been de  cided upon, how should a move be selected? The simplest process is to  consider all the possible moves in the given position and choose the one  that gives the best immediate evaluation. Since, however, chess players  generally look more than one move ahead, one must take account of the  opponent's various possible responses to each projected move. Assuming  that the opponent's reply will be the one giving the best evaluation from  his point of view, we would choose the move that would leave us as well  off as possible after his best reply. Unfortunately, with the computer  speeds at present available, the machine could not explore all the possi  bilities for more than two moves ahead for each side, so a strategy of this  type would play a poor game by human standards. Good chess players  frequently play combinations four or five moves deep, and occasionally  world champions have seen as many as 20 moves ahead. This is possible  only because the variations they consider are highly selected. They do not  investigate all lines of play, but only the important ones.   The amount of selection exercised by chess masters in examining possi  ble variations has been studied experimentally by the Dutch chess master  and psychologist A. D. De Groot. He showed various typical positions to  chess masters and asked them to decide on the best move, describing  aloud their analyses of the positions as they thought them through. By     A Chess-Playing Machine 2129   this procedure the number and depth of the variations examined could  be determined. In one typical case a chess master examined 16 variations,  ranging in depth from one Black move to five Black and four White  moves. The total number of positions considered was 44.   Clearly it would be highly desirable to improve the strategy for the  machine by including such a selection process in it. Of course one could  go too far in this direction. Investigating one particular line of play for  40 moves would be as bad as investigating all lines for just two moves.  A suitable compromise would be to examine only the important possible  variations that is, forcing moves, captures and main threats and carry  out the investigation of the possible moves far enough to make the conse  quences of each fairly clear. It is possible to set up some rough criteria  for selecting important variations, not as efficiently as a chess master, but  sufficiently well to reduce the number of variations appreciably and  thereby permit a deeper investigation of the moves actually considered.   The final problem is that of reducing the strategy to a sequence of  orders, translated into the machine's language. This is a relatively straight  forward but tedious process, and we shall only indicate some of the  general features. The complete program is made up of nine sub-programs  and a master program that calls the sub-programs into operation as  needed. Six of the sub-programs deal with the movements of the various  kinds of pieces. In effect they tell the machine the allowed moves for these  pieces. Another sub-program enables the machine to make a move "men  tally" without actually carrying it out: that is, with a given position stored  in its memory it can construct the position that would result if the move  were made. The seventh sub-program enables the computer to make a list  of all possible moves in a given position, and the last sub-program evalu  ates any given position. The master program correlates and supervises the  application of the sub-programs. It starts the seventh sub-program making  a list of possible moves, which in turn calls in previous sub-programs to  determine where the various pieces could move. The master program then  evaluates the resulting positions by means of the eighth sub-program and  compares the results according to the process described above. After  comparison of all the investigated variations, the one that gives the best  evaluation according to the machine's calculations is selected. This move  is translated into standard chess notation and typed out by the machine.   It is believed that an electronic computer programmed hi this manner  would play a fairly strong game at speeds comparable to human speeds. A  machine has several obvious advantages over a human player: (1) it can  make individual calculations with much greater speed; (2) its play is free  of errors other than those due to deficiencies of the program, whereas  human players often make very simple and obvious blunders; (3) it is free  from laziness, or the temptation to make an instinctive move without     21 -Q Claude E. Shannon   proper analysis of the position; (4) it is free from "nerves," so it will  make no blunders due to overconfidence or defeatism. Against these ad  vantages, however, must be weighed the flexibility, imagination and learn  ing capacity of the human mind.   Under some circumstances the machine might well defeat the program  designer. In one sense, the designer can surely outplay his machine; know  ing the strategy used by the machine, he can apply the same tactics at a  deeper level. But he would require several weeks to calculate a move, while  the machine uses only a few minutes. On an equal time basis, the speed,  patience and deadly accuracy of the machine would be telling against  human fallibility. Sufficiently nettled, however, the designer could easily  weaken the playing skill of the machine by changing the program in such  a way as to reduce the depth of investigation (see Figure 3). This idea  was expressed by a cartoon in The Saturday Evening Post a while ago.   As described so far, the machine would always make the same move  in the same position. If the opponent made the same moves, this would  always lead to the same game. Once the opponent won a game, he could  win every time thereafter by playing the same strategy, taking advantage  of some particular position in which the machine chooses a weak move.  One way to vary the machine's play would be to introduce a statistical  element. Whenever it was confronted with two or more possible moves  that were about equally good according to the machine's calculations, it  would choose from them at random. Thus if it arrived at the same position  a second time it might choose a different move.   Another place where statistical variation could be introduced is in the  opening game. It would be desirable to have a number of standard open  ings, perhaps a few hundred, stored in the memory of the machine. For  the first few moves, until the opponent deviated from the standard re  sponses or the machine reached the end of the stored sequence of moves,  the machine would play by memory, This could hardly be considered  cheating, since that is the way chess masters play the opening.   We may note that within its limits a machine of this type will play a  brilliant game. It will readily make spectacular sacrifices of important  pieces in order to gain a later advantage or to give checkmate, provided  the completion of the combination occurs within its computing limits. For  example, in the position illustrated in Figure 4 the machine would quickly  discover the sacrificial mate in three moves:   White Black   1. R-K8Ch RXR   2. Q-Kt4 Ch Q X Q   3. Kt-B6 Mate   Winning combinations of this type are frequently overlooked in amateur  play.     A Chess-Playing Machine     2131      FIGURE 3 Inevitable advantage of man over the machine is illustrated in this drawing. At top   human player loses to machine. In center nettled human player revises machine's in  structions. At bottom human player wins.     2132 Claude E. Shannon      FIGURE 4 Problem that the machine could solve brilliantly might begin with this chess position.  The machine would sacrifice a rook and a queen, the most powerful piece on the  board, and then win in only one more move.   The chief weakness of the machine is that it will not learn by its mis  takes. The only way to improve its play is by improving the program.  Some thought has been given to designing a program that would develop  its own improvements in strategy with increasing experience in play.  Although it appears to be theoretically possible, the methods thought of  so far do not seem to be very practical. One possibility is to devise a  program that would change the terms and coefficients involved in the  evaluation function on the basis of the results of games the machine had  already played. Small variations might be introduced in these terms, and  the values would be selected to give the greatest percentage of wins.   The Gordian question, more easily raised than answered is: Does a  chess-playing machine of this type "think"? The answer depends entirely  on how we define thinking. Since there is no general agreement as to the  precise connotation of this word, the question has no definite' answer.  From a behavioristic point of view, the machine acts as though it were  thinking. It has always been considered that skillful chess play requires  the reasoning faculty. If we regard thinking as a property of external  actions rather than internal method the machine is surely thinking.   The thinking process is considered by some psychologists to be essen  tially characterized by the following steps: various possible solutions of a  problem are tried out mentally or symbolically without actually being  carried out physically; the best solution is selected by a mental evaluation  of the results of these trials; and the solution found in this way is then  acted upon. It will be seen that this is almost an exact description of how     A Chess-Playing Machine 2133   a chess-playing computer operates, provided we substitute "within the  machine" for "mentally."   On the other hand, the machine does only what it has been told to do.  It works by trial and error, but the trials are trials that the program  designer ordered the machine to make, and the errors are called errors  because the evaluation function gives these variations low ratings. The  machine makes decisions, but the decisions were envisaged and provided  for at the time of design. In short, the machine does not, in any real sense,  go beyond what was built into it. The situation was nicely summarized by  Torres y Quevedo, who, in connection with his end-game machine, re  marked: "The limits within which thought is really necessary need to be  better defined ... the automaton can do many things that are popularly  classed as thought."     PART XX   Mathematics in Warfare     1. Mathematics in Warfare   by FREDERICK WILLIAM LANCHESTER   2. How to Hunt a Submarine   by PHILLIP M. MORSE and GEORGE E. KIMBALL     COMMENTARY ON   FREDERICK WILLIAM  LANCHESTER     T? REDBRICK WILLIAM LANCHESTER, an Englishman who died  A in 1946 at the age of 78, was interested, among other things, in  aerodynamics, economic and industrial problems, the theory of relativity,  fiscal policies and military strategy. His writings on these matters, apart  from high professional competence, exhibit such striking independence of  judgment and boldness of conception that it is surprising to learn he was  an engineer. 1 Lanchester was one of the first to recognize the extent to  which aircraft would alter the character of warfare. Nebulous profundities  had of course been uttered on the subject since Biblical times and even  military men the more advanced thinkers among them were aware by  the outbreak of the First World War that the airplane would change some  of their business methods. It was Lanchester, however, who first consid  ered the matter quantitatively. He set down his conclusions on the subject  in Aircraft in Warfare (1916), a book consisting . mainly of a series of  articles contributed in 1914 to the British journal Engineering. Lanchester  was convinced that most of the important operations hitherto entrusted to  land armies could be executed "as well or better by a squad or fleet of  aeronautical machines. If this should prove true, the number of flying  machines eventually to be utilized by any of the great military powers will  be counted not by hundreds but by thousands, and possibly by tens of  thousands, and the issue of any great battle will be definitely determined  by the efficiency of the aeronautical forces."   To prove his point, Lanchester found it necessary to make a mathe  matical analysis of the relation of opposing forces in battle. Under what  circumstances can a smaller army (or naval fleet) defeat a larger? Can  a mathematical measure be assigned to concentrations of firepower and,  if so, can equations in which such measures appear be set up to describe  what happens and what may be expected to happen in military engage-   1 "Lanchester made a brilliant analysis of the inherent stability of model airplanes  in 1897, long before there were real airplanes. His work was a little like a treatise on  the dynamics of the automobile before any automobile existed. The Physical Society  of London declined to print this paper, but some thirty years later Lanchester was  awarded a gold medal for it by the Royal Aeronautical Society." Jerome C. Hunsaker,  Aeronautics at the Mid-Century (Yale University Press, 1952). Lanchester was also  one of the foremost pioneers of automobile design. He built an experimental engine  in 1895 probably the first to be made in England. The Lanchester automobile was  put into production in 1900. It was an outstanding vehicle of the vintage period, in  corporating many unorthodox and advanced features.     2136     Frederick William Lanchester 2137   ments? These were among the questions he considered and for which he  devised the elegant Pythagorean formula described below.

But then today's wars have become  so elaborate that Mars himself would not recognize them and it was  inevitable that mathematics would have to keep up.

THE "N-SQUARE" LAW.   THE Principle of Concentration. It is necessary at the present juncture  to make a digression and to treat of certain fundamental considerations  which underlie the whole science and practice of warfare in all its  branches. One of the great questions at the root of all strategy is that of  concentration; the concentration of the whole resources of a belligerent  on a single purpose or object, and concurrently the concentration of the  main strength of his forces, whether naval or military, at one point in the  field of operations. But the principle of concentration is not in itself a  strategic principle; it applies with equal effect to purely tactical operations;  it is on its material side based upon facts of a purely scientific character.  The subject is somewhat befogged by many authors of repute, inasmuch  as the two distinct sides the moral concentration (the narrowing and  fixity of purpose) and the material concentration are both included  under one general heading, and one is invited to believe that there is  some peculiar virtue in the word concentration, like the "blessed word  Mesopotamia," whereas the truth is that the word in its two applications  refers to two entirely independent conceptions, whose underlying prin  ciples have nothing really in common.   The importance of concentration in the material sense is based on  certain elementary principles connected with the means of attack and  defence, and if we are properly to appreciate the value and importance of  concentration in this sense, we must not fix our attention too closely  upon the bare fact of concentration, but rather upon the underlying prin  ciples, and seek a more solid foundation in the study of the controlling  factors.   The Conditions of Ancient and Modern Warfare Contrasted. There is  an important difference between the methods of defence of primitive     2138     Mathematics in Warfare     2139     times and those of the present day which may be used to illustrate the  point at issue. In olden times, when weapon directly answered weapon,  the act of defence was positive and direct, the blow of sword or battleaxe  was parried by sword and shield; under modern conditions gun answers  gun, the defence from rifle-fire is rifle-fire, and the defence from artillery,  artillery. But the defence of modern arms is indirect: tersely, the enemy  is prevented from killing you by your killing him first, and the fighting  is essentially collective. As a consequence of this difference, the impor  tance of concentration in history has been by no means a constant quan  tity. Under the old conditions it was not possible by any strategic plan or  tactical manoeuvre to bring other than approximately equal numbers of  men into the actual fighting line; one man would ordinarily find himself  opposed to one man. Even were a General to concentrate twice the num  ber of men on any given portion of the field to that of the enemy, the  number of men actually wielding their weapons at any given instant (so  long as the fighting line was unbroken), was, roughly speaking, the same  on both sides. Under present-day conditions all this is changed. With  modern long-range weapons fire-arms, in brief the concentration of  superior numbers gives an immediate superiority in the active combatant  ranks, and the numerically inferior force finds itself under a far heavier  fire, man for man, than it is able to return. The importance of this differ  ence is greater than might casually be supposed, and, since it contains the  kernel of the whole question, it will be examined in detail.   In thus contrasting the ancient conditions with the modern, it is not  intended to suggest that the advantages of concentration did not, to some  extent, exist under the old order of things. For example, when an army  broke and fled, undoubtedly any numerical superiority of the victor could  be used with telling effect, and, before this, pressure, as distinct from  blows, would exercise great influence. Also the bow and arrow and the  cross-bow were weapons that possessed in a lesser degree the properties     . too     (a)     FIGURE 1     Frederick William Lanchester  2140   of fire-arms, inasmuch as they enabled numbers (within limits) to con  centrate their attack on the few. As here discussed, the conditions are  contrasted in their most accentuated form as extremes for the purpose of   illustration.   Taking first, the ancient conditions where man is opposed to man,  then assuming the combatants to be of equal fighting value, and other  conditions equal, clearly, on an average, as many of the "duels" that go to  make up the whole fight will go one way as the other, and there will be  about equal numbers killed of the forces engaged; so that if 1,000 men  meet 1,000 men, it is of little or no importance whether a "Blue" force  of 1,000 men meet a "Red" force of 1,000 men in a single pitched battle,  or whether the whole "Blue" force concentrates on 500 of the "Red"  force, and, having annihilated them, turns its attention to the other half;  there will, presuming the "Reds" stand their ground to the last, be half the  "Blue" force wiped out in the annihilation of the "Red" force 1 in the first  battle, and the second battle will start on terms of equality i.e., 500  "Blue" against 500 "Red."   Modern Conditions Investigated. Now let us take the modern condi  tions. If, again, we assume equal individual fighting value, and the com  batants otherwise (as to "cover," etc.) on terms of equality, each man  will in a given time score, on an average, a certain number of hits that  are effective; consequently, the number of men knocked out per unit time  will be directly proportional to the numerical strength of the opposing  force. Putting this in mathematical language, and employing symbol b to  represent the numerical strength of the "Blue" force, and r for the "Red,"   we have:   db   _ = -r X c .... (1)   dt  and   dr   = -bXk .... (2)   dt   in which / is time and c and k are constants (c = k if the fighting values  of the individual units of the force are equal).   The reduction of strength of the two forces may be represented by two  conjugate curves following the above equations. In Figure 1 (a) graphs  are given representing the case of the "Blue" force 1,000 strong encoun  tering a section of the "Red" force 500 strong, and it will be seen that  the "Red" force is wiped out of existence with a loss of only about 134  men of the "Blue" force, leaving 866 to meet the remaining 500 of the   1 This is not strictly true, since towards the close of the fight the last few men will  be attacked by more than their own number. The main principle is, however,  untouched.     Mathematics in Warfare     2141     "Red" force with an easy and decisive victory; this is shown in Figure 1  (Z>), the victorious "Blues" having annihilated the whole "Red" force of  equal total strength with a loss of only 293 men.     H+f      FIGURE la   In Figure 2a a case is given in which the "Red" force is inferior to the   "Blue" in the relation 1: V 2 sa y> a " Red " force lj000 strong meetin S a  "Blue" force 1,400 strong. Assuming they meet in a single pitched battle  fought to a conclusion, the upper line will represent the "Blue" force, and  it is seen that the "Reds" will be annihilated, the "Blues" losing only 400  men. If, on the other hand, the "Reds" by superior strategy compel the  "Blues" to give battle divided say into two equal armies then, Figure      FIGURE 2ft   2b, in the first battle the 700 "Blues" will be annihilated with a loss of  only 300 to the "Reds" and in the second battle the two armies will meet  on an equal numerical footing, and so we may presume the final battle of  the campaign as drawn. In this second case the result of the second battle     Frederick William Lanchester   is presumed from the initial equality of the forces; the curves are not  given.     Time *   FIGURE 3   In the case of equal forces the two conjugate curves become coincident;  there is a single curve of logarithmic form, Figure 3; the battle is pro  longed indefinitely. Since the forces actually consist of a finite number of  finite units (instead of an infinite number of infinitesimal units), the end  of the curve must show discontinuity, and break off abruptly when the  last man is reached; the law based on averages evidently does not hold  rigidly when the numbers become small. Beyond this, the condition of two  equal curves is unstable, and any advantage secured by either side will  tend to augment.   Graph representing Weakness of a Divided Force. In Figure 40, a pair  of conjugate curves have been plotted backwards from the vertical datum  representing the finish, and an upper graph has been added representing  the total of the "Red" force, which is equal in strength to the "Blue"  force for any ordinate, on the basis that the "Red" force is divided into  two portions as given by the intersection of the lower graph. In Figure 4b,  this diagram has been reduced to give the same information in terms per  cent, for a "Blue" force of constant value. Thus in its application Figure  4b gives the correct percentage increase necessary in the fighting value of,  for example, an army or fleet to give equality, on the assumption that  political or strategic necessities impose the condition of dividing the said  army or fleet into two in the proportions given by the lower graph, the  enemy being able to attack either proportion with his full strength. Alter  natively, if the constant (=100) be taken to represent a numerical     Mathematics in Warfare     2143      FIGURE 4a     FIGURE 4&   strength that would be deemed sufficient to ensure victory against the  enemy, given that both fleets engage in their full strength, then the upper  graph gives the numerical superiority needed to be equally sure of victory,  in case, from political or other strategic necessity, the fleet has to be  divided in the proportions given. In Figure 4b abscissae have no quanti  tative meaning.   Validity of Mathematical Treatment. There are many who will be in-     Frederick William Lanchester   clined to cavil at any mathematical or semi-mathematical treatment of  the present subject, on the ground that with so many unknown factors,  such as the morale or leadership of the men, the unaccounted merits or  demerits of the weapons, and the still more unknown "chances of war,"  it is ridiculous to pretend to calculate anything. The answer to this is  simple: the direct numerical comparison of the forces engaging in conflict  or available in the event of war is almost universal. It is a factor always  carefully reckoned with by the various military authorities; it is discussed  ad nauseam in the Press. Yet such direct counting of forces is in itself a  tacit acceptance of the applicability of mathematical principles, but con  fined to a special case. To accept without reserve the mere "counting of  the pieces" as of value, and to deny the more extended application of  mathematical theory, is as illogical and unintelligent as to accept broadly  and indiscriminately the balance and the weighing-machine as instruments  of precision, but to decline to permit in the latter case any allowance for  the known inequality of leverage.   Fighting Units not of Equal Strength. In the equations (1) and (2),  two constants were given, c and #, which in the plotting of the Figures  1 to 4b were taken as equal; the meaning of this is that the fighting  strength of the individual units has been assumed equal. This condition is  not necessarily fulfilled if the combatants be unequally trained, or of  different morale. Neither is it fulfilled if their weapons are of unequal  efficiency. The first two of these, together with a host of other factors too  numerous to mention, cannot be accounted for in an equation any more  than can the quality of wine or steel be estimated from the weight. The  question of weapons is, however, eminently suited to theoretical discus  sion. It is also a matter that (as will be subsequently shown) requires  consideration in relation to the main subject of the present articles.   Influence of Efficiency of Weapons. Any difference in the efficiency of  the weapons for example, the accuracy or rapidity of rifle-firemay be  represented by a disparity in the constants c and k in equations (1) and  (2). The case of the rifle or machine-gun is a simple example to take,  inasmuch as comparative figures are easily obtained which may be said  fairly to represent the fighting efficiency of the weapon. Now numerically  equal forces will no longer be forces of equal strength; they will only be  of equal strength if, when in combat, their losses result in no change in  their numerical proportion. Thus, if a "Blue" force initially 500 strong,  using a magazine rifle, attack a "Red" force of 1,000, armed with a single  breech-loader, and after a certain time the "Blue" are found to have lost  100 against 200 loss by the "Red," the proportions of the forces will have  suffered no change, and they may be regarded (due to the superiority of  the "Blue" arms) as being of equal strength.   If the condition of equality is given by writing M as representing the      Mathematics in Warfare 2145   efficiency or value of an individual unit of the "Blue" force, and N the  same for the "Red," we have:   Rate of reduction of "Blue" force:   db   = N r X constant . . (3)  dt   and "Red,"   dr   = M b X constant . . (4)  dt   And for the condition of equality,   db dr     or     or   Nr2 = M& 2 . . . (5)   In other words, the fighting strengths of the two forces are equal when  the square of the numerical strength multiplied by the fighting value of the  individual units are equal   The Outcome of the Investigation. The n-square Law. It is easy to show  that this expression (5) may be interpreted more generally; the fighting  strength of a force may be broadly defined as proportional to the square  of its numerical strength multiplied by the fighting value of its individual  units.   Thus, referring to Figure 4b, the sum of the squares of the two portions  of the "Red" force are for all values equal to the square of the "Blue"  force (the latter plotted as constant) ; the curve might equally well have  been plotted directly to this law as by the process given. A simple proof  of the truth of the above law as arising from the differential equations  (1) and (2), p. 2140, is as follows:   In Figure 5, let the numerical values of the "blue" and "red" forces  be represented by lines b and r as shown; then in an infinitesimally small  interval of time the change in. b and r will be represented respectively by  db and dr of such relative magnitude that db/dr = r/b or,   bdb = rdr (1)   If (Figure 5) we draw the squares on b and r and represent the incre  ments db and dr as small finite increments, we see at once that the change  of area of b 2 is 2b db and the change of area of r 2 is 2r dr which accord  ing to the foregoing ( 1 ) , are equal. Therefore the difference between the  two squares is constant   b 2 - r 2 = constant.     2146     Frederick William Lanchester           1.     FIGURE 5   If this constant be represented by a quantity q 2 then b 2 - r 2 + q 2 and  q represents the numerical value of the remainder of the blue "force"  after annihilation of the red. Alternatively q represents numerically a  second "red" army of the strength necessary in a separate action to place  the red forces on terms of equality, as in Figure 4b.   A Numerical Example. As an example of the above, let us assume an  army of 50,000 giving battle in turn to two armies of 40,000 and 30,000  respectively, equally well armed; then the strengths are equal, since  (50,000) 2 = (40,000) 2 -h (30,000) 2 . If, on the other hand, the two  smaller armies are given time to effect a junction, then the army of 50,000  will be overwhelmed, for the fighting strength of the opposing force,  70,000 is no longer equal, but is in fact nearly twice as great namely,  in the relation of 49 to 25. Superior morale or better tactics or a hundred  and one other extraneous causes may intervene in practice to modify the  issue, but this does not invalidate the mathematical statement.   Example Involving Weapons of Different Effective Value. Let us now  take an example in which a difference in the fighting value of the unit is  a factor. We will assume that, as a matter of experiment, one man em  ploying a machine-gun can punish a target to the same extent in a given  time as sixteen riflemen. What is the number of men armed with the  machine gun necessary to replace a battalion a thousand strong in the  field? Taking the fighting value of a rifleman as unity, let n = the number  required. The fighting strength of the battalion is, ( 1,000) 2 or,     / 1,000,000 1,000   n=J = = 250   V 16 4     or one quarter the number of the opposing force.     Mathematics in Warfare 2147   This example is instructive; it exhibits at once the utility and weakness  of the method. The basic assumption is that the fire of each force is  definitely concentrated on the opposing force. Thus the enemy will con  centrate on the one machine-gun operator the fire that would otherwise  be distributed over four riflemen, and so on an average he will only last  for one quarter the time, and at sixteen times the efficiency during his  short life he will only be able to do the work of four riflemen in lieu of  sixteen, as one might easily have supposed. This is in agreement with the  equation. The conditions may be regarded as corresponding to those  prevalent in the Boer War, when individual-aimed firing or sniping was  the order of the day.   When, on the other hand, the circumstances are such as to preclude  the possibility of such concentration, as when searching an area or ridge  at long range, or volley firing at a position, or "into the brown," the  basic conditions are violated, and the value of the individual machine-gun  operator becomes more nearly that of the sixteen riflemen that the power  of his weapon represents. The same applies when he is opposed by  shrapnel fire or any other weapon which is directed at a position rather  than the individual. It is well thus to call attention to the variations in the  conditions and the nature of the resulting departure from the conclusions  of theory; such variations are far less common in naval than in military  warfare; the individual unit the ship is always the gunner's mark.  When we come to deal with aircraft, we shall find the conditions in this  respect more closely resemble those that obtain in the Navy than in the  Army; the enemy's aircraft individually rather than collectively is the  air-gunner's mark, and the law herein laid down will be applicable.   The Hypothesis Varied. Apart from its connection with the main sub  ject, the present line of treatment has a certain fascination, and leads to  results which, though probably correct, are in some degree unexpected.  If we modify the initial hypothesis to harmonise with the conditions of  long-range fire, and assume the fire concentrated on a certain area known  to be held by the enemy, and take this area to be independent of the  numerical value of the forces, then, with notation as before, we have   db   =bXN   t \. X constant.   dr   = rXM   dt   or   Udb Ndr   dt "~ dt     .g Frederick William Lanchester   or the rate of loss is independent of the numbers engaged, and is directly  as the efficiency of the weapons. Under these conditions the fighting  strength of the forces is directly proportional to their numerical strength;  there is no direct value in concentration, qua concentration, and the ad  vantage of rapid fire is relatively great. Thus in effect the conditions  approximate more closely to those of ancient warfare.   An Unexpected Deduction. Evidently it is the business of a numerically  superior force to come to close quarters, or, at least, to get within decisive  range as rapidly as possible, in order that the concentration may tell to  advantage. As an extreme case, let us imagine a "Blue" force of 100 men  armed with the machine gun opposed by a "Red" 1,200 men armed with  the ordinary service rifle. Our first assumption will be that both forces are  spread over a front of given length and at long range. Then the "Red"  force will lose 16 men to the "Blue" force loss of one, and, if the combat  is continued under these conditions, the "Reds" must lose. If, however,  the "Reds" advance, and get within short range, where each man and  gunner is an individual mark, the tables are turned, the previous equation  and conditions apply, and, even if "Reds" lose half their effective in  gaining the new position, with 600 men remaining they are masters of  the situation; their strength is 600 2 X 1 against the "Blue" 100 2 X 16. It  is certainly a not altogether expected result that, in the case of fire so  deadly as the modern machine-gun, circumstances may arise that render  it imperative, and at all costs, to come to close range.   Examples from History. It is at least agreed by all authorities that on  the field of battle concentration is a matter of the most vital importance;  in fact, it is admitted to be one of the controlling factors both in the  strategy and tactics of modern warfare. It is aptly illustrated by the im  portant results that have been obtained in some of the great battles of  history by the attacking of opposing forces before concentration has been  effected. A classic example is that of the defeat by Napoleon, in his  Italian campaign, of the Austrians near Verona, where he dealt with the  two Austrian armies in detail before they had been able to effect a junc  tion, or even to act in concert. Again, the same principle is exemplified in  the oft-quoted case of the defeat of Jourdan and Moreau on the Danube  by the Archduke Charles in 1796. It is evident that the conditions in the  broad field of military operations correspond in kind, if not in degree, to  the earlier hypothesis, and that the law deduced therefrom, that the fight  ing strength of a force can be represented by the square of its numerical  strength, does, in its essence, represent an important truth.   THE "N-SQUARE" LAW IN ITS APPLICATION   The n-square Law in its Application to a Heterogeneous Force. In the  preceding article it was demonstrated that under the conditions of mod-     Mathematics in Warfare     2149     era warfare the fighting strength of a force, so far as it depends upon its  numerical strength, is best represented or measured by the square of the  number of units. In land operations these units may be the actual men  engaged, or in an artillery duel the gun battery may be the unit; in a  naval battle the number of units will be the number of capital ships, or  in an action between aeroplanes the number of machines. In all cases  where the individual fighting strength of the component units may be  different it has been shown that if a numerical fighting value can be  assigned to these units, the fighting strength of the whole force is as the  square of the number multiplied by their individual strength. Where the  component units differ among themselves, as in the case of a fleet that  is not homogeneous, the measure of the total of fighting strength of a  force will be the square of the sum of the square roots of the strengths of  its individual units.   Graphic Representation, Before attempting to apply the foregoing,  either as touching the conduct of aerial warfare or the equipment of the  fighting aeroplane, it is of interest to examine a few special cases and  applications in other directions and to discuss certain possible limitations.  A convenient graphic form in which the operation of the n-square law  can be presented is given in Figure 6; here the strengths of a number of  separate armies or forces successively mobilised and brought into action  are represented numerically by the lines a, b, c, d, e, and the aggregate  fighting strengths of these armies are given by the lengths of the lines  A, B, C, D, E, each being the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle, as  indicated. Thus two forces or armies a and b, if acting separately (hi  point of time), have only the fighting strength of a single force or army      2150 Frederick William Lanchester   represented numerically by the line B. Again, the three separate forces,  a, b, and c, could be met on equal terms in three successive battles by a  single army of the numerical strength C 3 and so on.   Special or Extreme Case. From the diagram given in Figure 6 arises a  special case that at first sight may look like a reductio ad absurdum, but  which, correctly interpreted, is actually a confirmation of the n-square  law. Referring to Figure 6, let us take it that the initial force (army or  fleet), is of some definite finite magnitude, but that the later arrivals  b t c, d } etc., be very small and numerous detachments so small, in fact,  as to be reasonably represented to the scale of the diagram as infinitesimal  quantities. Then the lines b, c, d, e, f, etc., describe a polygonal figure  approximating to a circle, which in the limit becomes a circle, whose  radius is represented by the original force a, Figure 7. Here we have  graphically represented the result that the fighting value of the added  forces, no matter what their numerical aggregate (represented in Figure 7  by the circumferential line), is zero. The correct interpretation of this      FIGURE 7   is that in the open a small force attacking, or attacked by one of over  whelming magnitude is wiped out of existence without being able to exact  a toll even comparable to its own numerical value; it is necessary to say  in the open, since, under other circumstances, the larger force is unable to  bring its weapons to bear, and this is an essential portion of the basic  hypothesis. In the limiting case when the disparity of force is extreme, the  capacity of the lesser force to effect anything at all becomes negligible.     Mathematics in Warfare 2151   There is nothing improbable in this conclusion, but it manifestly does not  apply to the case of a small force concealed or "dug in," since the hypoth  esis is infringed. Put bluntly, the condition represented in Figure 7  illustrates the complete impotence of small forces in the presence of one  of overwhelming power. Once more we are led to contrast the ancient  conditions, under which the weapons of a large army could not be brought  to bear, with modern conditions, where it is physically possible for the  weapons of ten thousand to be concentrated on one. Macaulay's lines     "In yon strait path a thousand  May well be stopped by three,'     belong intrinsically to the methods and conditions of the past.   The N-square Law in Naval Warfare. We have already seen that the  n-square law applies broadly, if imperfectly, to military operations; on  land however, there sometimes exist special conditions and a multitude of  factors extraneous to the hypothesis whereby its operation may be sus  pended or masked. In the case of naval warfare, however, the conditions  more strictly conform to our basic assumptions, and there are compara  tively few disturbing factors. Thus, when battle fleet meets battle fleet,  there is no advantage to the defender analogous to that secured by the  entrenchment of infantry. Again, from the time of opening fire, the indi  vidual ship is the mark of the gunner, and there is no phase of the battle  or range at which areas are searched in a general way. In a naval battle  every shot fired is aimed or directed at some definite one of the enemy's  ships; there is no firing on the mass or "into the brown." Under the old  conditions of the sailing-ship and cannon of some 1,000 or 1,200 yards  maximum effective range, advantage could be taken of concentration  within limits; and an examination of the latter 18th century tactics makes  it apparent that with any ordinary disparity of numbers (probably in no  case exceeding 2 to 1 ) the effect of concentration must have been not far  from that indicated by theory. But to whatever extent this was the case, it  is certain that with a battle-fleet action at the present day the conditions  are still more favourable to the weight of numbers, since with the mod  ern battle range some 4 to 5 miles there is virtually no limit to the  degree of concentration of fire. Further than this, there is in modern  naval warfare practically no chance of coming to close quarters in ship-to-  ship combats, as in the old days.   Thus the conditions are to-day almost ideal from the point of view of  theoretical treatment. A numerical superiority of ships of individually  equal strength will mean definitely that the inferior fleet at the outset has  to face the full fire of the superior, and as the battle proceeds and the  smaller fleet is knocked to pieces, the initial disparity will become worse  and worse, and the fire to which it is subjected more and more concen-     Frederick William Lanchester     trated. These are precisely the conditions taken as the basis of the investi  gation from which the n-square law has been derived. The same  observations will probably be found to apply to aerial warfare when air  fleets engage in conflict, more especially so in view of the fact that aero  plane can attack aeroplane in three dimensions of space instead of being  limited to two, as is the case with the battleship. This will mean that even  with weapons of moderate range the degree of fire concentration possible  will be very great. By attacking from above and below, as well as from  all points of the compass, there is, within reason, no limit to the number  of machines which can be brought to bear on a given small force of the  enemy, and so a numerically superior fleet will be able to reap every ounce  of advantage from its numbers.   Individual Value of Ships or Units. The factor the most difficult to  assess in the evaluation of a fleet as a fighting machine is (apart from the  personnel) the individual value of its units, when these vary amongst  themselves. There is no possibility of entirely obviating this difficulty,  since the fighting value of any given ship depends not only upon its gun  armament, but also upon its protective armour. One ship may be stronger  than another at some one range, and weaker at some longer or shorter  range, so that the question of fleet strength can never be reduced quite to  a matter of simple arithmetic, nor the design of the battleship to an  exact science. In practice the drawing up of a naval programme resolves  itself, in great part at least, into the answering of the prospective enemy's  programme type by type and ship by ship. It is, however, generally ac  cepted that so long as we are confining our attention! to the main battle  fleets, and so are dealing with ships of closely comparable gun calibre  and range, and armour of approximately equivalent weight, the fighting  value of the individual ship may be gauged by the weight of its "broad  side," or more accurately, taking into account the speed with which the  different guns can be served, by the weight of shot that can be thrown  per minute. Another basis, and one that perhaps affords a fairer compari  son, is to give the figure for the energy per minute for broadside fire,  which represents, if we like so to express it, the horsepower of the ship  as a fighting machine. Similar means of comparison will probably be  found applicable to the fighting aeroplane, though it may be that the  downward fire capacity will be regarded as of vital importance rather than  the broadside fire as pertaining to the battleship.   Applications of the n-square Law. The n-square law tells us at once  the price or penalty that must be paid if elementary principles are out  raged by the division of our battle fleet 2 into two or more isolated detach  ments. In this respect our present disposition a single battle fleet or  "Grand" fleet is far more economical and strategically preferable as a  2 Capital ships: Dreadnoughts and Super-Dreadnoughts.     Mathematics in Warfare 2153   defensive power to the old-time distribution of the Channel Fleet, Medi  terranean Fleet, etc. If it had been really necessary, for any political or  geographical reason, to maintain two separate battle fleets at such distance  asunder as to preclude their immediate concentration in case of attack,  the cost to the country would have been enormously increased. In the      FIGURE 8 Single or "Grand" Fleet of Equal Strength (Lines give numerical values).   case, for example, of our total battle fleet being separated into two equal  parts, forming separate fleets or squadrons, the increase would require to  be fixed at approximately 40 per cent. that is to say, in the relation of  1 to V 2 ' more generally the solution is given by a right-angled triangle,  as in Figure 8. In must not be forgotten that, even with this enormous  increase, the security will not be so great as appears on paper, for the  enemy's fleet, having met and defeated one section of our fleet, may suc  ceed in falling back on his base for repair and refit, and emerge later with  the advantage of strength in his favour. Also one must not overlook the  demoralizing effect on the personnel of the fleet first to go into action, of  the knowledge that they are hopelessly outnumbered and already beaten  on paper that they are, in fact, regarded by their King and country as  "cannon fodder." Further than this, presuming two successive fleet actions  and the enemy finally beaten, the cost of victory in men and materiel will  be greater in the case of the divided fleet than in the case of a single fleet  of equal total fighting strength, in -the proportion of the total numbers  engaged that is to say, in Figure 8, in the proportion that the two sides  of the right-angled triangle are greater than the hypotenuse.   In brief, however potent political or geographical influences or reasons  may be, it is questionable whether under any circumstances it can be  considered sound strategy to divide the main battle fleet on which the  defence of a country depends. This is to-day the accepted view of every  naval strategist of repute, and is the basis of the present distribution of  Great Britain's naval forces.     Frederick William Lanchestcr  2154   Fire Concentration the Basis of Naval Tactics. The question of fire  concentration is again found to be paramount when we turn to the consid  eration and study of naval tactics. It is worthy of note that the recognition  of the value of any definite tactical scheme does not seem to have been  universal until quite the latter end of the 18th century. It is even said that  the French Admiral Suffren, about the year 1780, went so far as to attrib  ute the reverses suffered by the French at sea to "the introduction of  tactics" which he stigmatised as "the veil of timidity"; the probability is  that the then existing standard of seamanship in the French Navy was  so low that anything beyond the simplest of manoeuvres led to confusion,  not unattended by danger. The subject, however, was, about that date,  receiving considerable attention. A writer, Clerk, about 1780, pointed out  that in meeting the attack of the English the French had adopted a system  of defence consisting of a kind of running fight, in which, initially taking  the "lee gage," they would await the English attack in line ahead, and  having delivered their broadsides on the leading English ships (advancing  usually in line abreast), they would bear away to leeward and take up  position, once more waiting for the renewal of the attack, when the same  process was repeated. By these tactics the French obtained a concentra  tion of fire on a small portion of the English fleet, and so were able  to inflict severe punishment with little injury to themselves. 4 Here we  see the beginnings of sound tactical method adapted to the needs of   defence.   Up to the date in question there appears to have been no studied at  tempt to found a scheme of attack on the basis of concentration; the old  order was to give battle in parallel columns or lines, ship to ship, the  excess of ships, if either force were numerically superior, being doubled  on the rear ships of the enemy. It was not till the "Battle of the Saints,"  in 1782, that a change took place; Rodney (by accident or intention)  broke away from tradition, and cutting through the lines of the enemy,  was able to concentrate on his centre and rear, achieving thereby a deci  sive victory.   British Naval Tactics in 1805. The Nelson "Touch" The accident or  experiment of 1782 had evidently become the established tactics of the  British in the course of the twenty years which followed, for not only do  we find the method in question carefully laid down in the plan of attack  given in the Memorandum issued by Nelson just prior to the Battle of  Trafalgar in 1805, but the French Admiral Villeneuve 5 confidently as  serted in a note issued to his staff in anticipation of the battle that:   3 Mahan, "Sea Power," page 425. . .   4 Incidentally, also, the scheme in question had the advantage of subjecting the  English to a raking fire from the French broadsides before they were themselves able  to bring their own broadside fire to bear.   5 "The Enemy at Trafalgar," Ed. Eraser; Hodder and Stoughton, page 54.     Mathematics in Warfare     2155     "The British Fleet will not be formed in a line-of-battle parallel to the  combined fleet according to the usage of former days. Nelson, assuming  him to be, as represented, really in command, will seek to break our line,  envelop our rear, and overpower with groups of his ships as many as he  can isolate and cut off." Here we have a concise statement of a definite  tactical scheme based on a clear understanding of the advantages of fire  concentration.   It will be understood by those acquainted with the sailing-ship of the  period that the van could only turn to come to the assistance of those in  the rear at the cost of a considerable interval of time, especially if the  van should happen to be to leeward of the centre and rear. The time  taken to "wear ship," or in light winds to "go about" (often only to be  effected by manning the boats and rowing to assist the manoeuvre), was  by no means an inconsiderable item. Thus it would not uncommonly be  a matter of some hours before the leading ships could be brought within  decisive range, and take an active part in the fray.   Nelson's Memorandum and Tactical Scheme. In order further to em  barrass the the enemy's van, and more effectively to prevent it from com  ing into action, it became part of the scheme of attack that a few ships, a  comparatively insignificant force, should be told off to intercept and en  gage as many of the leading ships as possible; in brief, to fight an Inde  pendent action on a small scale; we may say admittedly a losing action.  In this connection Nelson's memorandum of October 9 is illuminating.  Nelson assumed for the purpose of framing his plan of attack that his own  force would consist of forty sail of the line, against forty-six of the com-      J     BRITISH TOTAL  COMBINED     4O  46     FIGURE 9     Frederick William Lanchester  2156   bined (French and Spanish) fleet. These numbers are considerably greater,  as things turned out, than those ultimately engaged; but we are here deal-  ing with the memorandum, and not with the actual battle. The British  Fleet was to form in two main columns, comprising sixteen sail of the line  each, and a smaller column of eight ships only. The plan of attack  prescribed in the event of the enemy being found in line ahead was briefly  as follows: One of the main columns was to cut the enemy's line about  the centre, the other to break through about twelve ships from the rear,  the smaller column being ordered to engage the rear of the enemy's van  three or four ships ahead of the centre, and to frustrate, as far as possible,  every effort the van might make to come to the succour of the threatened  centre or rear. Its object, in short, was to prevent the van of the combined  fleet from taking part in the main action. The plan is shown diagram-  matically in Figure 9 (p. 2155).   Nelson's Tactical Scheme Analysed. An examination of the numerical  values resulting from the foregoing disposition is instructive. The force  with which Nelson planned to envelop the half i.e., 23 ships of the  combined fleet amounted to 32 ships in all; this according to the n 2 law  would give him a superiority of fighting strength of almost exactly two to  one, 6 and would mean that if subsequently he had to meet the other half  of the combined fleet, without allowing for any injury done by the special  eight-ship column, he would have been able to do so on terms of equality.  The fact that the van of the combined fleet would most certainly be in  some degree crippled by its previous encounter is an indication and meas  ure of the positive advantage of strength provided by the tactical scheme.  Dealing with the position arithmetically, we have:   Strength of British (in arbitrary n 2 units),   32 2 + 8 2 =1088  And combined fleet,   3 2 = 1058     British advantage .... 30  Or, the numerical equivalent of the remains of the British Fleet (assum     ing the action fought to the last gasp), = \/3Q or 5% ships.   If for the purpose of comparison we suppose the total forces had en  gaged under the conditions described by Villeneuve as "the usage of  former days," we have:   Strength of combined fleet, 46 2 ---- =2116  British " 40 2 . . , . = 1600     Balance in favour of enemy .... 516   6 23 X V2 = 32.5.     Mathematics in Warfare 2157   Or, the equivalent numerical value of the remainder of the -combined  fleet, assuming complete annihilation of the British, = \/516 = 23 ships  approximately.   Thus we are led to appreciate the commanding importance of a correct  tactical scheme. If in the actual battle the old-time method of attack had  been adopted, it is extremely doubtful whether the superior seamanship  and gunnery of the British could have averted defeat. The actual forces  on the day were 27 British sail of the line against the combined fleet  numbering 33, a rather less favourable ratio than assumed in the Memo  randum. In the battle, as it took place, the British attacked in two col  umns instead of three, as laid down in the Memorandum; but the scheme  of concentration followed the original idea. The fact that the wind was of  the lightest was alone sufficient to determine the exclusion of the enemy's  van from the action. However, as a study the Memorandum is far more  important than the actual event, and in the foregoing analysis it is truly  remarkable to find, firstly, the definite statement of the cutting the enemy  into two equal parts according to the n-square law the exact proportion  corresponding to the reduction of his total effective strength to a mini  mum; and, secondly, the selection of a proportion, the nearest whole-  number equivalent to the \/2 ratio of theory, required to give a fighting  strength equal to tackling the two halves of the enemy on level terms, and  the detachment of the remainder, the column of eight sail, to weaken  and impede the leading half of the enemy's fleet to guarantee the success  of the main idea. If, as might fairly be assumed, the foregoing is more  than a coincidence, 7 it suggests itself that Nelson, if not actually ac  quainted with the n-square law, must have had some equivalent basis on  which to figure his tactical values.   7 Although we may take it to be a case in which the dictates of experience resulted  in a disposition now confirmed by theory, the agreement is remarkable.     COMMENTARY ON   Operations Research     THE sprawling activity known as operations research had its beginning  during the Second World War, Science has of course contributed ideas  to destruction since the time of Archimedes and in both the great wars  of the present century it furnished the technical assistance making possible  the development of every major weapon from the machine gun to the  atom bomb. Operations research, however, is a different kind of scientific  work. It is a conglomerate of methods. It has been defined as "a scientific  method of providing executive departments with a quantitative basis for  decisions regarding the operations under their control." The definition is a  little inflated but it conveys the general outline of the subject.   In the last war operational analysts were to be found at work in strange  places and under unlikely circumstances. Mathematicians discussed gun  nery problems with British soldiers in Burma; chemists did bomb damage  assessment with economist colleagues at Princes Risborough, a "secure"  headquarters outside London; generals conferred about tank strategy in  the Italian campaign with biochemists and lawyers; a famous British  zoologist was key man in planning the bombardment of Pantellaria; naval  officers took statisticians and entomologists into their confidence regarding  submarine losses in the Pacific; the high command of the R.A.F. and  American Airforce shared its headaches over Rumanian oil fields, French  marshaling yards, German ball-bearing and propeller factories and myste  rious ski-sites in the Pas-de-Calais with psychologists, architects, paleon  tologists, astronomers and physicists. It was a lively, informal, paradoxical  exchange of ideas between amateur and professional warmakers and it  produced some brilliant successes. It led to the solution of important  gunnery and bombardment problems; improved the efficiency of our anti  submarine air patrol in the Bay of Biscay and elsewhere; shed light on  convoying methods in the North Atlantic; helped our submarines to catch  enemy ships and also to avoid getting caught; supplied a quantitative  basis for weapons evaluation; altered basic concepts of air to air and  naval combat; simplified difficult recurring problems of supply and trans  port. There were of course many more failures than successes but the  over-all record is impressive.   What scientists brought to operational problems apart from specialized  knowledge was the scientific outlook. This in fact was their major con  tribution. They tended to think anew, to suspect preconceptions, to act  only on evidence. Their indispensable tool was the mathematics of prob  ability and they made use of its subtlest theories and most powerful tech-     2158     Operations Research 2159   niques. They were unhampered by laboratory dogma, but the experimental  method was their inseparable guide. A thoughtful student of the subject,  the British mathematician J. Bronowski, has aptly described their work:  "A war or a battle, a mission or a sortie, none is repeatable and none is  an experiment. Yet the young scientists brought to them the conviction  that in them and nowhere else must be found the empirical evidence for  the Tightness or wrongness of the assumptions and underlying strategy by  which war is made. The passion of these men was to trace in operations  involving life and death the tough skeleton of experimental truth." l   The material I have selected is from the best book thus far published  on the subject. Morse, a physicist, and Kimball, a chemist, 2 had wide  experience in operations research in the last war, and subsequently as  consultants. The examples are confined to military problems but I should  point out that, having got its start in the war, operations research is now  being extended to engineering, to communication, to coal mining, to busi  ness, to manufacture and to other branches of industry. The new problems  are not as easy or as enticing as were many of the military exercises (even  the art of war, now that the simple mistakes have been put right, offers a  less "creamy surface to skim") and opinions differ as to whether first-class  men will find satisfaction in such work. I incline to Bronowski's view:  "The heroic age is over; and dropping with a sigh the glamour and the  heady sense of power, we have to face the recognition that the field of  opportunity will never again be quite so blank, so simple and so lavish.  What was new and speculative on the battlefield turns out, in the practical  affairs of industry, to become only a painstaking combination of cost  accounting, job analysis, time and motion study and the general integra  tion of plant flow. There is an extension of this to the larger economics  of whole industries and nations, but it is hardly likely to be rewarding to  first-rate scientists and calls at bottom for the immense educational task  of interesting economists and administrators in the mathematics of  differentials and of prediction."   Sir Charles Darwin has suggested that in the future not too remote  computing machines will take over the job. This is more likely, at any  rate, than that administrators will master differentials.   1 Review of the Morse and Kimball book (Methods of Operations Research, New  York, 1951) in Scientific American, October 1951, pp. 75-77.   2 Dr. Phillip M. Morse is a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology. During the war he was director of the U. S. Navy Operations Research  Group and he has since held other equally responsible positions in the field. Dr.  George E. Kimball was, among others, Deputy Director, Operations Evaluation  Group, U. S. Navy and is now professor of chemistry at Columbia University.     Yet out of the same fountain come instruments of lust, and also instruments  of death. For (not to speak of the arts of procurers) the most exquisite  poisons, as well as guns, and such like engines of destruction, are the fruits  of mechanical invention; and well we knew how far in cruelty and destruc-  tiveness they exceed the Minotaur himself. FRANCIS BACON     2 How to Hunt a Submarine   By PHILLIP M. MORSE  and GEORGE K KIMBALL     . . . JUST as with every other field of applied science, the improvement  of operations of war by the application of scientific analysis requires a  certain flair which comes with practice, but which is difficult to put into  words.   It is important first to obtain an overall quantitative picture of the oper  ation under study. One must first see what is similar in operations of a  given kind before it will be worthwhile seeing how they differ from each  other. In order to make a start in so complex a subject, one must ruth  lessly strip away details (which can be taken into account later), and  arrive at a few broad, very approximate "constants of the operation." By  studying the variations of these constants, one can then perhaps begin to  see how to improve the operation.   It is well to emphasize that these constants which measure the operation  are useful even though they are extremely approximate; it might almost  be said that they are more valuable because they are very approximate.  This is because successful application of operations research usually re  sults in improvements by factors of 3 or 10 or more. Many operations are  ineffectively compared to their theoretical optimum because of a single  faulty component: inadequate training of crews, or incorrect use of equip  ment, or inadequate equipment. Usually, when the "bottleneck" has been  discovered and removed, the improvements in effectiveness are measured  in hundreds or even thousands of per cent. In our first study of any  operation we are looking for these large factors of possible improvement.  They can be discovered if the constants of the operation are given only to  one significant figure, and any greater accuracy simply adds unessential  detail.   One might term this type of thinking "hemibel thinking." A bel is  defined as a unit in a logarithmic scale x corresponding to a factor of 10.   1 This suggests the advantage of using logarithmic graph paper in plotting data.  Unity is zero hemibels, 3 is 1 hemibel, 10 is 2 hemibels, 30 is 3 hemibels, and 10,000  is 8 hemibels. A hemibel is 5 decibels. An appropriate abbreviation would be -fab,  corresponding to db for decibel.   2160     How to Hunt a Submarine 2161   Consequently, a hemibel corresponds to a factor of the square root of 10,  or approximately 3. Ordinarily, in the preliminary analysis of an opera  tion, it is sufficient to locate the value of the constant to within a factor  of 3. Hemibel thinking is extremely useful in any branch of science, and  most successful scientists employ it habitually. It is particularly useful in  operations research.   Having obtained the constants of the operation under study in units of  hemibels (or to one significant figure), we take our next step by comparing  these constants. We first compare the value of the constants obtained in  actual operations with the optimum theoretical value, if this can be com  puted. If the actual value is within a hemibel (i.e., within a factor of 3)  of the theoretical value, then it is extremely unlikely that any improve  ment in the details of the operation will result in significant improvement.  In the usual case, however, there is a wide gap between the actual and  theoretical results. In these cases a hint as to the possible means of im  provement can usually be obtained by a crude sorting of the operational  data to see whether changes in personnel, equipment, or tactics produce  a significant change in the constants. In many cases a theoretical study of  the optimum values of the constants will indicate possibilities of improve  ment. . . .   SWEEP RATES   An important function for some naval forces, particularly for some  naval aircraft, is that of scouting or patrol, that is, search for the enemy.  In submarine warfare search is particularly important. The submarine  must find the enemy shipping before it can fire its torpedoes, and the anti  submarine craft must find the enemy submarine in order to attack it, or  to route its convoys evasively, and so on.   Patrol or search is an operation which is peculiarly amenable to opera  tions research. The action is simple, and repeated often enough under  conditions sufficiently similar to enable satisfactory data to be accumu  lated. From these data measures of effectiveness can be computed period  ically from which a great deal can be deduced. By comparing the  operational values of the constants with the theoretically optimum values,  one can obtain an overall picture as to the efficiency of our own forces.  Sudden changes in the constants without change in our own tactics will  usually mean a change in enemy tactics which, of course, needs investiga  tion and usually counteraction.   CALCULATION OF CONSTANTS   In the simplest case a number of search units (e.g., aircraft or sub  marine) are sent into a certain area A of the ocean to search for enemy     216 2 Phillip M. Morse and George E. Kimball   craft. A total of T units of time (hours or days) is spent by one or  another of the search craft in the area, and a number of contacts C with  an enemy unit are reported. It is obvious that the total number of contacts  obtained in a month is not a significant measure of the effectiveness of  the searching craft because it depends on the length of time spent in  searching. A more useful constant would be the average number of con  tacts made in the area per unit of time spent in searching (C divided   by T).   The number of contacts per unit of searching time is a simple measure  which is useful for some purposes and not useful for others. As long as  the scene of the search remains the same, the quantity (C/T) depends  on the efficiency of the individual searching craft and also on the number  N of enemy craft which are in the area on the average. Consequently, any  sudden change in this quantity would indicate a change in enemy conceal  ment tactics, or else a change in the number of enemy craft present. Since  this quantity depends so strongly on the enemy's actions, it is not a satis  factory one to compare against theoretically optimum values in order to  see whether the searching effort can be appreciably improved or not. Nor  is it an expedient quantity to use in comparing the search efforts in two  different areas.   A large area is more difficult to search over than a small one since it  takes more time to cover the larger area with the same density of search.  Consequently, the number of contacts per unit searching time should be  multiplied by the area searched over in order to compensate for this area  effect, and so that the searching effort in two different areas can be  compared on a more or less equal basis.   OPERATIONAL SWEEP RATE   One further particularly profitable step can be taken, if other sources  of intelligence allow one to estimate (to within a factor of 3) the average  number of enemy craft in the area while the search was going on.   The quantity which can then be computed is the number of contacts  per unit search time, multiplied by the area searched over and divided  by the estimated number of enemy units in the area. Since the dimensions  of this quantity are square miles per hour, it is usually called the effective,  or operational, sweep rate.   Operational sweep rate:     '=(}   \NT)     f_ _ _ . square miles  1 (1)   hour (or day)     C = number of contacts;  A area searched over in square miles;  T = total searching time in hours (or days) ;  N = probable number of enemy craft in area.     How to Hunt a Submarine 2163   This quantity is a measure of the ability of a single search craft to find a  single enemy unit under actual operational conditions. It equals the effec  tive area of ocean swept over by a single search craft in an hour (or day).  Another way of looking at this constant is taken by remembering that  (N/A ) is the average density of target craft, in number per square mile.  Since (C/T) is the number of contacts produced per hour (or day)  g op =i (C/T) -T- (N/A ) is the number of contacts which would be ob  tained per hour (or day) if the density of target craft were one per square  mile.   THEORETICAL SWEEP RATE   Sweep rates can be compared from area to area and from time to time,  since the effects of different size of areas and of different numbers of  enemy craft are already balanced out. Sweep rates can also be compared  with the theoretical optimum for the craft in question. Elsewhere we have  shown that the sweep rate is equal to twice the "effective lateral range of  detection" of the search craft equipment, multiplied by the speed of the  search craft. 2   Theoretical sweep rate:   square miles   fi th = 2#v (2)   hour (or day)   R = effective lateral range of detection in miles;  v = average speed of search craft in miles per hour (or day).  A comparison of this sweep rate with the operational value will provide  us with the criterion for excellence which we need.   The ratio between <2 op and <2 th is a factor which depends both on the  effectiveness of our side in using the search equipment available, and on  the effectiveness of the enemy in evading detection. For instance, if the  search craft is a plane equipped with radar, and if the radar is in poor  operational condition on the average, this ratio will be correspondingly  diminished. Similarly, if the enemy craft is a submarine, then a reduction  of the average time it spent on the surface would reduce the ratio for  search planes using radar or visual sighting. The ratio also would be  reduced if the area were covered by the searching craft in a nonuniform  manner, and if the enemy craft tended to congregate in those regions  which were searched least. Correspondingly, the ratio (2 op /Gth) will be  increased (and may even be greater than unity) if the enemy craft tend to  congregate in one region of the area, and if the searching effort is also  concentrated there. It can be seen that a comparison of the two sweep  rates constitutes a very powerful means of following the fluctuations in  efficacy of the search operation as the warfare develops.   2 [The reference is to another section of the book from which this excerpt has been  taken. ED.]     Phillip A/. Morse and George E. Kimball  SUBMARINE PATROL   A few examples will show the usefulness of the quantities mentioned  here. The first example comes from data on the sighting of merchant  vessels by submarines on patrol. Typical figures are given in Table 1. All  numbers are rounded off to one or two significant figures, since the esti-   TABLE 1. CONTACTS ON MERCHANT VESSELS BY SUBMARINES   Region B D E   Area, sq. miles, A 80,000 250,000 400,000   Avg.

The  operational sweep rate (computed from the data) is also tabulated. Since  the ratio of the values of Q for regions B and E is less than 1 hemibel, the  difference in the sweep rates for those regions is probably due to the  rather wide limits of error of the values of N. The difference in sweep  rate between areas B and D is probably significant however (it corre  sponds to a ratio of more than a hemibel) . Investigation of this difference  shows that the antisubmarine activity in region B was considerably more  effective than in D, and, consequently, the submarines in region B had  to spend more time submerged and had correspondingly less time to make  sightings. The obvious suggestion (unless there are other strategic reasons  to the contrary) is to transfer some of the effort from region B to region  D, since the yield per submarine per day is as good, and since the danger  to the submarine is considerably less.   For purposes of comparison, we compute the theoretrical sweep rate.  A submarine on patrol covers about 200 miles a day on the average, and  the average range of visibility for a merchant vessel is between 15 and 20  miles. The theoretical sweep rate, therefore, is about 6,000 to 8,000 square  miles per day. This corresponds remarkably closely with the operational  sweep rate in regions D and E. The close correspondence indicates that  the submarines are seeing all the shipping they could be expected to see  (i.e., with detection equipment having a range of 15 to 20 miles). It also  indicates that the enemy has not been at all successful in evading the  patrolling submarines, for such evasion would have shown up as a relative     How to Hunt a Submarine 2165   diminution in > op . The reduced value of sweep rate in region B has al  ready been explained.   Therefore, a study of the sweep rate for submarines against merchant  vessels has indicated (for the case tabulated) that no important amount  of shipping is missed because of poor training of lookouts or of failure of  detection equipment. It has also indicated that one of the three regions is  less productive than the other two; further investigation has revealed the  reason. The fact that each submarine in region D sighted one ship in  every five that passed through the region is a further indication of the  extraordinary effectiveness of the submarines patrolling these areas.     AIRCRAFT SEARCH FOR SUBMARINES   Another example, not quite so impressive, but perhaps more instructive,  can be taken from data on search for submarines by antisubmarine air  craft. Typical values are shown in Table 2, for three successive months,  for three contiguous areas. Here the quantity T represents the total time  spent by aircraft over the ocean on antisubmarine patrol of all sorts in  the region during the month in question. The quantity C represents the  total number of verified sightings of a surfaced submarine in the area and  during the month in question. From these data the value of the opera  tional sweep rate, <2 op , can be computed and is expressed also on a hemibel  scale. From these figures a number of interesting conclusions can be  drawn, and a number of useful suggestions can be made for the improv  ing of the operational results.   TABLE 2. SIGHTINGS OF SUBMARINES BY ANTISUBMARINE AIRCRAFT   Region ABC   Area, sq. miles, A 300,000 600,000 900,000   Month AMJ AMI AMI   Avg.

The usual antisubmarine patrol plane flies at a speed of about  150 knots. The average range of visibility of a surfaced U-boat in flyable  weather is about 10 miles. Therefore, if the submarines were on the sur  face all of the time during which the planes were searching, we should  expect the theoretical search rate to be 3,000 square miles per hour, ac  cording to equation (2). On the hemibel scale this is a value of 7. If the     2j6 Phillip M. Morse and George E. Kimball   submarines on the average spent a certain fraction of the time submerged,  then g th would be proportionally diminished. We see that the average  value of the sweep rate in regions B and C is about one-tenth (2 hemibels)  smaller than the maximum theoretical value of 3,000.   Part of this discrepancy is undoubtedly due to the submergence tactics  of the submarines. In fact, the sudden rise in the sweep rate in region B  from April to May was later discovered to be almost entirely due to a  change in tactics on the part of the submarines. During the latter month  the submarines carried on an all-out attack, coming closer to shore than  before or since, and staying longer on the surface, in order to sight more  shipping, This bolder policy exposed the submarines to too many attacks,  so they returned to more cautious tactics in June. The episode serves to  indicate that at least one-half of the 2 hemibel discrepancy between opera  tional and theoretically maximum sweep rates is probably due to the sub  mergence tactics of the submarine.   The other factor of 3 is partially attributable to a deficiency in opera  tional training and practice in antisubmarine lookout keeping. Antisub  marine patrol is a monotonous duty. The average plane can fly for  hundreds of hours (representing an elapsed time of six months or more)  before a sighting is made. Experience has shown that, unless special com  petitive practice exercises are used continuously, performance of such  tasks can easily fall below one-third of their maximum effectiveness. Data  in similar circumstances, mentioned later in this chapter, show that a  diversion of 10 per cent of the operational effort into carefully planned  practice can increase the overall effectiveness by factors of two to four.   We have thus partially explained the discrepancy between the opera  tional sweep rate in regions B and C and the theoretically optimum sweep  rate; we have seen the reason for the sudden increase for one month in  region B. We must now investigate the result of region A which displays  a consistently low score in spite of (or perhaps because of) the large num  ber of antisubmarine flying hours in the region. Search in region A is  consistently 1 hemibel worse (a factor of 3) than in the other two regions.  Study of the details of the attacks indicates that the submarines were not  more wary in this region; the factor of 3 could thus not be explained by  assuming that the submarines spent one-third as much time on the surface  in region A. Nor could training entirely account for the difference. A  number of new squadrons were "broken in" in region A, but even the  more experienced squadrons turned in the lower average.   DISTRIBUTION OF FLYING EFFORT   In this case the actual track plans of the antisubmarine patrols in  region A were studied in order to see whether the patrol perhaps concen-     How to Hunt a Submarine 2167   TABLE 3.

This indeed proved to be the case, for it was found that a dispropor  tionately large fraction of the total antisubmarine flying in region A was  too close to shore to have a very large chance of finding a submarine on  the surface. The data for the month of April (and also for other months)  was broken down according to the amount of patrol time spent a given  distance off shore. The results for the one month are given in Table 3. In  this analysis it was not necessary to compute the sweep rate, but only to  compare the number of contacts per thousand hours flown in various  strips at different distances from the shore. This simplification is possible  since different strips of the same region are being compared for the same  periods of time; consequently, the areas are equal and the average distri  bution of submarines is the same. The simplification is desirable since it is  not known, even approximately, where the seven submarines, which were  present in that region in that month, were distributed among the offshore  zones.   A comparison of the differ ent values of contacts per 1,000 hours flown  for the different offshore bands immediately explains the ineffectiveness  of the search effort in region A. Flying in the inner zone, where three-  quarters of the flying was done, is only one-tenth as effective as flying in  the outer zone, where less than 1 per cent of the flying was done. Due  perhaps to the large amount of flying in the inner zone, the submarines  did not come this close to shore very often, and, when they came, kept  well submerged. In the outer zones, however, they appeared to have been  as unwary as in region B in the month of May.   If a redistribution of flying effort would not have changed submarine  tactics, then a shift of 2,000 hours of flying per month from the inner  zone to the outer (which would have made practically no change in the  density of flying in the inner zone, but which would have increased the  density of flying in the outer zone by a factor of 13) would have approxi  mately doubled the number of contacts made in the whole region during  that month. Actually, of course, when a more uniform distribution of fly  ing effort was inaugurated in this region, the submarines in the outer zones     216g Phillip M. Morse and George E. Kimbatt   soon became more wary and the number of contacts per thousand hours  flown in the outer region soon dropped to about 4 or 5. This still repre  sented a factor of 3, however, over the inshore flying yield. We therefore  can conclude that the discrepancy of one hemibel in sweep rate between  region A and regions B and C is primarily due to a maldistribution of  patrol flying in region A, the great preponderance of flying in that region  being in localities where the submarines were not. When these facts were  pointed out, a certain amount of redistribution of flying was made (within  the limitations imposed by other factors), and a certain amount of im  provement was observed.   The case described here is not a unique one; in fact, it is a good illus  tration of a situation often encountered in operations research. The  planning officials did not have the time to make the detailed analysis  necessary for the filling in of Table 3. They saw that many more contacts  were being made on submarines close inshore than farther out, and they  did not have at hand the data to show that this was entirely due to the  fact that nearly all the flying was close to shore. The data on contacts,  which is more conspicuous, might have actually persuaded the operations  officer to increase still further the proportion of flying close to shore. Only  a detailed analysis of the amount of flying time in each zone, resulting in  a tabulation of the sort given in Table 3, was able to give the officer a  true picture of the situation. When this had been done, it was possible for  the officer to balance the discernible gains to be obtained by increasing the  offshore flying against other possible detriments. In this case, as with most  others encountered in this field, other factors enter; the usefulness of the  patrol planes could not be measured solely by their collection of contacts,  and the other factors favored inshore flying.   ANTISUBMARINE FLYING IN THE BAY OF BISCAY   An example of the use of sweep rate for following tactical changes in  a- phase of warfare will be taken from the RAF Coastal Command  struggle against German U-boats in the Bay of Biscay. After the Germans  had captured France, the Bay of Biscay ports were the principal opera  tional bases for U-boats. Nearly all of the German submarines operating  in the Atlantic went out and came back through the Bay of Biscay. About  the beginning of 1942, when the RAF began to have enough long range  planes, a number of them were assigned to antisubmarine duty in the Bay  to harass these transit U-boats. Since the submarines had to be discov  ered before they could be attacked, and since these planes were out only  to attack submarines, a measure of the success of the campaign was the  number of U-boat sightings made by the aircraft.   The relevant data for this part of the operation are shown in Figure 1     How to Hunt a Submarine 2169   for the years 1942 and 1943. The number of hours of antisubmarine  patrol flying in the Bay per month, the number of sightings of U-boats  resulting, and the estimated average number of U-boats in the Bay area  during the month are plotted in the upper part of the figure. From these  values and from the area of the Bay searched over (130,000 square  miles) , one can compute the values of the operational sweep rate which  are shown in the lower half of the figure.   The graph for Q op indicates that two complete cycles of events have  occurred during the two years shown. The first half of 1942 and the first  half of 1943 gave sweep rates of the order of 300 square miles per hour,  which correspond favorably with the sweep rates obtained in regions B  and C in Table 2. The factor of 10 difference between these values and  the theoretically maximum value of 3,000 square miles per hour can be  explained, as before, partly by the known discrepancy between lookout  practice in actual operation and theoretically optimum lookout effective  ness, and mainly by submarine evasive tactics. It was known at the begin  ning of 1942 that the submarines came to the surface for the most part  at night, and stayed submerged during a good part of the day. Since most  of the antisubmarine patrols were during daylight, these tactics could  account for a possible factor of 5, leaving a factor of 2 to be accounted  for (perhaps) by lookout fatigue, etc.   During the early part of 1942, the air cover over the Bay of Biscay in  creased, and the transit submarines began to experience a serious number  of attacks. In the spring a few squadrons of radar planes were equipped  for night-flying, with searchlights to enable them to make attacks at night  on the submarines. When these went into operation, the effective search  rate for all types of planes increased at first. The night-flying planes caught  a large number of submarines on the surface at night. These night attacks  caused the submarines to submerge more at night and surface more in  the daytime; therefore the day-flying planes also found more submarines  on the surface.   The consequent additional hazard to the U-boats forced a counter-  measure from the Germans; for even though the night-flying was a small  percentage of the total air effort in the Bay, the effects of night attack on  morale were quite serious. The Germans started equipping their sub  marines with radar receivers capable of hearing the L-band radar set  carried in the British planes. When these sets were operating properly,  they would give the submarine adequate warning of the approach of a  radar plane, so that it could submerge before the plane could make a  sighting or attack. Despite difficulties in getting the sets to work effectively,  they became more and more successful, and the operational sweep rate for  the British planes dropped abruptly in the late summer of 1942, reaching  a value about one-fifth of that previously attained.     2170     Phillip M.

How to Hunt a Submarine 2171   When this low value of sweep rate continued for several months, it was  obviously necessary for the British to introduce a new measure. This was  done by fitting the antisubmarine aircraft with S-band radar which could  not be detected by the L-band receivers on the German submarines at  that time. Commencing with the first of 1943, the sweep rate accordingly  rose again as more and more planes were fitted with the shorter wave  radar sets. Again the U-boats proved particularly susceptible to the attacks  of night-flying planes equipped with the new radar sets and with search  lights. By midsummer of 1943, the sweep rate was back as high as it had  been a year before.   The obvious German countermeasure was to equip the submarines with  S-band receivers. This, however, involved a great many design and manu  facturing difficulties, and these receivers were not to be available until the  fall of 1943. In the interim the Germans sharply reduced the number of  submarines sent out, and instructed those which did go out to stay sub  merged as much as possible in the Bay region. This reduced the opera  tional sweep rate for the RAF planes to some extent, and, by the time  the U-boats had been equipped with S-band receivers in the fall, the sweep  rate reached the same low values it had reached in the previous fall. The  later cycle, which occurred in 1944, involved other factors which we will  not have time to discuss here.   This last example shows how it is sometimes possible to watch the  overall course of a part of warfare by watching the fluctuations of a  measure of effectiveness. One can at the same time see the actual benefits  accruing from a new measure and also see how effective are the counter-  measures. By keeping a month-to-month chart of the quantity, one can  time the introduction of new measures, and also can assess the danger of  an enemy measure. A number of other examples of this sort will be given  later in this chapter.   EXCHANGE RATES   A useful measure of effectiveness for all forms of warfare is the ex  change rate, the ratio between enemy loss and own loss. Knowledge of  its value enables one to estimate the cost of any given operation and to  balance this cost against other benefits accruing from the operation. Here  again a great deal of insight can be obtained into the tactical trends by  comparing exchange rates; in particular, by determining how the rate de  pends on the relative strength of the forces involved.   When the engagement is between similar units, as in a battle between  tanks or between fighter planes, the units of strength on each side are the  same, and the problem is fairly straightforward. Data are needed on a  large number of engagements involving a range of sizes of forces involved.  Data on the strength of the opposed, forces at the beginning of each     2172 Phillip M. Morse and George E. Kimball   engagement and on the resulting losses to both sides are needed. These can  then be subjected to statistical analysis to determine the dependence of the  losses on the other factors involved.   Suppose m and n are the number of own and enemy units involved, and  suppose k and I are the respective losses in the single engagements. In gen  eral, k and / will depend on m and n, and the nature of the dependence is  determined by the tactics involved in the engagement. For instance, if the  engagement consists of a sequence of individual combats between single  opposed units, then both k and / are proportional to either m or n (which  ever is smaller), and the exchange rate (l/k) is independent of the size  of the opposing forces. On the other hand, if each unit on one side gets  about an equal chance to shoot at each unit on the other side, then the  losses on one side will be proportional to the number of opposing units  (that is, k will be proportional to , and / will be proportional to m).   AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT   The engagements between American and Japanese fighter aircraft in  the Pacific in 1943-44 seem to have corresponded more closely to the  individual-combat type of engagements. The data which have been ana  lyzed indicate that the exchange rate for Japanese against U. S. fighters  (l/k) was approximately independent of the size of the forces in the en  gagement. The percentage of Japanese fighters lost per engagement seems  to have been independent of the numbers involved (i.e., k was propor  tional to ri) ; whereas the percentage of U. S. fighters lost per engagement  seemed to increase with an increase of Japanese fighters, and decrease with  an increase of U. S. fighters (i.e., / was also proportional to 72).   The exchange rate for U. S. fighters in the Pacific during the years 1943  and 1944 remained at the surprisingly high value of approximately 10.  This circumstance contributed to a very high degree to the success of the  U. S. Navy in the Pacific. It was, therefore, of importance to analyze  as far as possible the reasons for this high exchange rate in order to see  the importance of the various contributing factors, such as training and  combat experience, the effect of the characteristics of planes, etc. The  problem is naturally very complex, and it is possible here only to give an  indication of the relative importance of the contributing factors.   Certainly a very considerable factor has been the longer training which  the U. S. pilots underwent compared to the Japanese pilots. A thorough  going study of the results of training and of the proper balance between  primary training and operational practice training has not yet been made,  so that a quantitative appraisal of the effects of training is as yet impos  sible. Later in this chapter we shall give an example which indicates that  it sometimes is worth while even to withdraw aircraft from operations for     How to Hunt a Submarine 2173   a short time in order to give the pilots increased training. 3 There is con  siderable need for further operational research in such problems. It is  suspected that, in general, the total effectiveness of many forces would be  increased if somewhat more time were given to refresher training in the  field, and slightly less to operations.   The combat experience of the pilot involved has also had its part in  the high exchange rate. The RAF Fighter Command Operations Research  Group has studied the chance of a pilot being shot down as a function of  the number of combats the pilot has been in. This chance decreases by  about a factor of 3 from the first to the sixth combat. A study made by  the Operations Research Group, U. S. Army Air .Forces, indicates that  the chance of shooting down the enemy when once in a combat increases  by 50 per cent or more with increasing experience.   The exchange rate will also depend on the types of planes entering the  engagement. An analysis of British-German engagements indicates that  Spitfire 9 has an exchange rate about twice that of Spitfire 5. The differ  ence is probably mostly due to the difference in speed, about 40 knots.  There are indications that the exchange rate for F6F-5 is considerably  larger than that for the F6F-3. Since the factors of training, experience,  and plane type all appear to have been in the favor of the United States,  it is not surprising that the exchange rate turned out to be as large  as 10.   TACTICS TO EVADE TORPEDOES   The last example given in this section will continue the analysis of the  submarine versus submarine problem discussed. It has been shown that  there was a possibility that our own submarines in the Pacific were being  torpedoed by Japanese submarines, and that there was a good chance that  several of our casualties were due to this cause. Presumably the danger  was greatest when our submarine was traveling on the surface and the  enemy submarine was submerged. It was important, therefore, to consider  possible measures to minimize this danger. One possibility was to install  a simple underwater listening device beneath the hull of the submarine,  to indicate the presence of a torpedo headed toward the submarine. Tor  pedoes driven by compressed air can be spotted by a lookout, since they  leave a characteristic wake; electric torpedoes, on the other hand, cannot  be spotted by their wake. All types of torpedoes, however, have to run at  a speed considerably greater than that of the target, and therefore their  propellers generate a great deal of underwater sound. This sound, a char  acteristic high whine, can be detected by very simple underwater micro  phones, and the general direction from which the sound comes can be  determined by fairly simple means.  3 [Not included in this selection. ED.]     2174 Phillip M. Morse and George E. Kimball   Microphone equipment to perform this function had already been de  veloped by NDRC; it remained to determine the value of installing it. In  other words, even if the torpedo could be heard and warning given, could  it be evaded? The chief possibility, of course, lay in radical maneuvers. A  submarine (or a ship) presents a much smaller target to the torpedo end  on than it does broadside. Consequently, as soon as a torpedo is heard,  and its direction is determined, it is advisable for the submarine to turn  toward or away from the torpedo, depending on which is the easier  maneuver.   GEOMETRICAL DETAILS   The situation is shown in Figure 2. Here the submarine is shown travel  ing with speed u along the dash-dot line.

For correct firing, the torpedo  is not aimed at where the submarine is, but at where the submarine will  be when the torpedo gets there. The relation between the track angle <,  the angle on the bow 6, the speed of torpedo and submarine, and the range  R can be worked out from the geometry of triangles. The aim, of course,  is never perfect, and operational data indicate that the standard deviation  for torpedoes fired from U. S. submarines is about 6 degrees of angle.   In most cases, more than one torpedo is fired. For instance, if three  torpedoes are fired in a salvo, the center torpedo is usually aimed at the  center of the target. If the other two are aimed to hit the bow and stern  of the target, the salvo of three is said to have a 100 per cent spread. Due     How to Hunt a Submarine 2175   to the probable error in aim, it turns out to be somewhat better to increase  the spread to 150 per cent, so that, if the aim were perfect, the center  torpedo would hit amidships, and the other two would miss ahead and  astern. Analysis of the type to be given later shows that a salvo of three  with 150 per cent spread gives a somewhat greater probability of hit than  does a salvo with 100 per cent spread. 4   A glance at Figure 2 shows that if the track angle <j> is less than 90 the  submarine should turn as sharply as possible toward the torpedoes in  order to present as small a target as possible; if the track angle is greater  than 90 the turn should be away from the torpedoes. Assuming a three  torpedo salvo, with 150 per cent spread and 7 standard deviation in aim,  and knowing the maximum rate of turn of the submarine and the speed  of the submarine and torpedo, it is then possible to compute the prob  ability of hit of the salvo, as a function of the angle-on-the-bow and the  range R at which the submarine starts its turn. If the range is large  enough, the submarine can turn completely toward or away from the  torpedoes (this is called "combing the tracks") and may even move com  pletely outside of the track of the salvo. If the torpedoes are not discovered  until at short range, however, very little improvement can be obtained by  turning.   One can therefore compute the probability of hitting the submarine if  it starts to turn when it hears a torpedo at some range and angle-on-the-  bow. This can be plotted on a diagram showing contours of equal prob  ability of sinking, and these can be compared with contours for probability  of sinking if the submarine takes no evasive action, but continues on a  straight course. A typical set of contours is shown in Figure 3.   The solid contours show the probabilities of a hit when the submarine  takes correct evasive action. The dotted contours give the corresponding  chances when a submarine continues on a steady course. One sees that the  dotted contour for 30 per cent chance of hit covers a much greater area  than a solid contour for the same chance. In other words, at these longer  ranges the evasive action of the submarine has a greater effect. The con  tours for 60 per cent chance of hit do not show the corresponding im  provement, since, by the time the torpedo is so close to the submarine,  maneuver has little chance of helping the situation. One sees that, if one  can hear the torpedo as far away as 2,000 yards, a very large reduction in  the chance of being hit can be produced by the correct evasive maneuvers.   Since these contours represent, in effect, vulnerability diagrams for  torpedo attack, they suggest the directions in which lookout activity should  be emphasized. The greatest danger exists at a relative bearing correspond  ing to a 90 degree track angle, and the sector from about 30 degrees to   4 [Not included in this selection. ED.]     2176     Phillip M.

The  narrow separation of the contours corresponding to evasive action empha  sizes the extreme importance of the range of torpedo detection. In many  instances a reduction of 500 yards in detection range may cut in half the  target probability of escaping.   Another factor vital to the efficacy of evasive turning is the promptness  with which it is initiated. For 45-knot torpedoes, every 10 seconds delay  in execution of the turn corresponds approximately to a reduction of 250  yards in the distance from the torpedo to the target. Thus it is apparent  that a 20 seconds delay in beginning the evasive turning will probably  halve the chances of successful evasion.   These same calculations, with different speeds and different dimensions  for the target vessel, may be used to indicate to the submarine where it is  best to launch its torpedoes in order to minimize the effect of evasive turn  ing of the target ship. One sees that it is best to launch torpedoes, if  possible, with a track angle of approximately 90 degrees. One sees also  the importance of coming close to the target before firing the salvo, since  evasive action is much less effective when begun with the torpedo less  than 2,000 yards away.   This study showed the value of good torpedo-detection microphones,  with ranges of at least 2,000 yards, and supported the case for their being     How to Hunt a Submarine     2177     installed on fleet submarines. Publication of the study to the fleet indi  cating the danger from Japanese submarines and of the usefulness of  evasive turns, produced an alertness which saved at least four U. S. sub  marines from being torpedoed, according to the records.   THE SQUID PROBLEM   As a somewhat more complicated example, we shall now consider the  problem of determining the effectiveness of the antisubmarine device  known as Squid. This is a device which throws three proximity-fuzed  depth charges ahead of the launching ship in a triangular pattern. In order  to simplify the problem we shall make the assumption that the heading     <X5r-      80 120 160 200 40 280 320 360  TORPEDO SPREAD .a   FIGURE 4 Probability of sinking ship with spread of three torpedoes.   of the submarine is known, and also the assumption that the aiming errors  are distributed in a circular normal fashion, with the same standard devi-      200     300 400 500   STANDARD DISPERSION V     60O     700     FIGURE 5 Optimum spread as a function of dispersion of aiming errors.     2178 Phillip M.

We wish to determine the best pattern for the depth  charges.   For any given pattern, the pattern damage function depends on two  variables, x and y, the aiming errors along and perpendicular to the course  of the submarine. For any pair of values of x and y, D p (x, y) is 1 if the  submarine is sunk, and otherwise. A typical case is shown in Figure 6.  The origin is the point of aim, and the positions of the depth charges in  the pattern are indicated by crosses. Each possible position of the center  of the submarine is represented by a point in this plane. (Note that x and  y are actually the negatives of the aiming errors.) The three shaded  regions represent the positions at which the submarine is destroyed by  each of the three depth charges. The pattern damage function is 1 inside  the shaded regions, and in the unshaded regions.      FIGURE 6 Damage function for "Squid" pattern.     How to Hunt a Submarine 2179   Let /O, y) dxdy be the probability that the center of the submarine be  in the area element dxdy. Then the probability of destroying the sub  marine is   '= / D(x,y)f(x,y)dxdy   (1)  = / f(x,y)dxdy.     In the last equation the region D of integration is just the shaded area in  Figure 6. Because of the irregular shape of this region, analytical evalu  ation of this integral is impractical, and graphical methods must be used.  In problems of this type a very convenient aid is a form of graph paper  known as "circular probability paper." This paper is divided into cells in  such a way that, if a point is chosen from a circular normal distribution,  the point is equally likely to fall in any of the cells. If an area is drawn  on the paper, the chance of a point falling inside the area is proportional  to the number of cells in the area. It follows that the integral of equation  ( 1 ) can be easily evaluated by drawing the damage function to the proper  scale on circular probability paper, and counting the cells in the shaded  area.   This method gives a rapid means of finding the probability of destroy  ing the submarine with any given pattern. To find the best pattern, we  note that changing the position of any one of the depth charges amounts  to shifting the corresponding shaded area in Figure 6 parallel to itself to  a new position. If three templates are made by cutting the outline of the  shaded area for a single depth charge out of a sheet of transparent mate  rial, to the correct scale to go with the circular probability paper, then  the best pattern can be found by moving the templates around on a sheet  of circular probability paper until the number of cells within the lethal  area is a maximum.     PART XXI     A Mathematical Theory  of Art   1. Mathematics of Aesthetics by GEORGE DAVID BIRKHOFF     COMMENTARY ON   GEORGE DAVID BIRKHOFF     /GEORGE DAVID BIRKHOFF (1884-1944) was a leading figure  vJT among the mathematicians of the present century. He stood out for  the powerful faculty which he brought to bear on complex and funda  mental problems, and for the diversity of his researches. He cared about  many things and took fruitful thought to all of them.   Birkhoff studied at Chicago and at Harvard. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis  on differential equations and continued to work in this field and in group  theory during his early teaching years at the University of Wisconsin and  at Princeton, A memoir published in 1911 1 on the theory of difference  equations attracted wide notice, as did an extremely ingenious verification,  two years later, of a famous conjecture by Poincare as to the topological  properties of a ring-shaped region bounded by concentric circles. This  proof was important because it uncovered an interesting relationship be  tween analysis situs and dynamics. Poincar6 had predicted this result by  pointing out that, if his conjecture were verified, "it would lead to con  cluding the existence of infinitely many periodic motions in the restricted  problem of three bodies and similar problems." 2 Birkhoff continued to  win recognition for papers on general dynamics and the theory of orbits,  turning his attention in these studies from the purely mathematical topics  with which he had dealt at the outset of his career. He was thus led to his  investigations of the ergodic hypothesis.   Some eighty years ago the German physicist Boltzmann gave the name  ergodic "to those mechanical systems which had the property that each  particular motion, when continued indefinitely, passes through every con  figuration and state of motion of the system which is compatible with the  value of the total energy." 3 Clerk Maxwell and Boltzmann put forward  the hypothesis that "the systems considered in the kinetic theory of gases  are ergodic," and Birkhoff produced a beautiful theorem to prove that  these intuitions were justified. He showed that an "idealized billiard ball"  moving on an "idealized convex billiard table" tends "in the limit to lie  in any assigned area of the table a definite proportion of the time." 4 The  theorem is not of vital significance to billiard players but turns out to be  applicable to numerous deep problems of analysis in applied mathematics.   1 "General theory of linear difference equations," Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 12  XI 911), 242-284. Much of the information in this note is taken from the obituary on  Birkhoff by Sir Edmund T. Whittaker, Journal of the London Mathematical Society,  Vol. 20, Part 2, April 1945, pp. 121-128.   2 Whittaker, op. cit., p. 124.   3 Whittaker, op. cit., p. 125.   4 G. D.

American Mathematical  Monthly, Vol. 49, April 1942.     2182     George David Birkhoff 2183   Among them is the celebrated celestial mechanics problem of three bodies  astronomical counterparts of the billiard ball. 5   Birkhoff contributed to the development of point-set theory, to the  study of n-dimensional space and to mathematical physics. He wrote two  books on relativity which were "widely read and characteristically original  in treatment." 6 In the latter part of the 1920s he began to formulate  his views on a relatively novel subject, the mathematical treatment of  aesthetics. Pythagoras, it will be recalled, had some time earlier applied  mathematics to music by showing that certain simple arithmetical ratios  of lengths of strings determined the musical intervals: the octave, fifth  and fourth. 7 Birkhoff was similarly attracted to aesthetics by an interest  in the formal structure of Western music, but he later conceived the more  ambitious goal of creating a "general mathematical theory of the fine arts,  which would do for aesthetics what had been achieved in another philo  sophical subject, logic, by the symbolisms of Boole, Peano, and Russell." 8  He describes the aesthetic feeling as "intuitive" and "sui generis," but  holds nevertheless that the attributes upon which aesthetic value depends  are accessible to measure. Three main variables constitute "the typical  aesthetic experience": the complexity (C) of the object, the feeling of  value or aesthetic measure (M), and the property of harmony, symmetry  or order (O) . These yield the basic formula     expressing the hypothesis that the aesthetic measure is determined "by the  density of order relations in the aesthetic object." The formula may be  regarded as a symbolic restatement of the famous definition of the Beau  tiful by the eighteenth-century Dutch philosopher Frans Hemsterhuis:  "that which gives us the greatest number of ideas in the shortest space of  time." 9 Birkhoff proceeded from this basic definition to a consideration  of what appeals to us in polygonal forms, ornaments, vases, diatonic  chords and harmony, melody, and the musical quality in poetry. 10   5 "Thus in G. W. Hill's celebrated idealization of the 'earth-sun-moon problem  (the restricted problem of three bodies) we can at once assert (with probability 1)  that the moon possesses a true mean angular state of rotation about the earth (meas  ured from the epoch), the same in both directions of time.*' Birkhoff, loc. cit.   6 Birkhoff, Relativity and Modern Physics, with the co-operation of R.

D.  Birkhoff, Aesthetic Measure, Cambridge, 1933, p. 90.   8 Whittaker, op. cit., p. 127.   9 Lettre sur la sculpture, 1769.   10 The first account of BirkhofFs theory of aesthetic measure was given in 1928 at  Bologna: Atti Congressi Bologna, I (1928), 315-333; the most complete statement  appears in his book Aesthetic Measure, Cambridge, 1933.     2ig4 Editor's Comment   Having applied his methods to aesthetics, he was emboldened to tackle  ethics. The question presented itself "almost irresistibly*' to his mind: "Is  not a similar treatment of analytic ethics possible?" Here too he had been  anticipated by Pythagoras who had asserted that "justice is represented  by a square number." This is not a very heavy contribution to science or  to morals, but it has the considerable merit of not contradicting any other  definition of justice; also it is pleasingly mystical. BirkhofFs approach is  not mystical, though he applauds Pythagoras. He outlines a rational pro  gram to "clarify and codify the vast ethical domain." The formula of  ethical measure is analogous in many respects to the earlier undertaking  in aesthetics.   The two selections following exhibit the inventiveness and the stimulat  ing play of BirkhofF s mind. His views are modestly put forward; no claim  is made that they form a well-rounded system. For my part, they are un  convincing but never tedious. In any case it may be argued that mathe  maticians should have a turn at examining the beautiful and the good;  philosophers, theologians, writers on aesthetics and other experts have  been probing these matters for more than 2000 years without making any  notable advance.     The business of a poet is to examine not the individual but the species;  to remark general properties and large appearances. He does not number  the streaks of the tulip, or describe the different shades of verdure of the  forest; he is to exhibit . . . such prominent and striking features as recall  the original to every mind, SAMUEL JOHNSON (Imlac in Rasselas)     1 Mathematics of Aesthetics   By GEORGE DAVID BIRKHOFF   THE BASIC FORMULA   1. THE AESTHETIC PROBLEM   MANY auditory and visual perceptions are accompanied by a certain  intuitive feeling of value, which is clearly separable from sensuous, emo  tional, moral, or intellectual feeling. The branch of knowledge called  aesthetics is concerned primarily with this aesthetic feeling and the aesthetic  objects which produce it.   There are numerous kinds of aesthetic objects, and each gives rise to  aesthetic feeling which is sui generis. Such objects fall, however, in two  categories: some, like sunsets, are found in nature, while others are created  by the artist. The first category is more or less accidental in quality, while  the second category comes into existence as the free expression of aesthetic  ideals. It is for this reason that art rather than nature provides the prin  cipal material of aesthetics.   Of primary significance for aesthetics is the fact that the objects belong  ing to a definite class admit of direct intuitive comparison with respect  to aesthetic value. The artist and the connoisseur excel in their power to  make discriminations of this kind.   To the extent that aesthetics is successful in its scientific aims, it must  provide some rational basis for such intuitive comparisons. In fact it is  the fundamental problem of aesthetics to determine, within each class of  aesthetic objects, those specific attributes upon which the aesthetic value  depends.   2. NATURE OF THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE   The typical aesthetic experience may be regarded as compounded of  three successive phases: (1) a preliminary effort of attention, which is  necessary for the act of perception, and which increases in proportion to  what we shall call the complexity (C) of the object; (2) the feeling of  value or aesthetic measure (M) which rewards this effort; and finally (3)   2185     - 10 .. George David Birkhoff   zloo   a realization that the object is characterized by a certain harmony, sym  metry, or order (O), more or less concealed, which seems necessary to  the aesthetic effect.   3. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM   This analysis of the aesthetic experience suggests that the aesthetic feel  ings arise primarily because of an unusual degree of harmonious inter  relation within the object. More definitely, if we regard M, O, and C as  measurable variables, we are led to write     and thus to embody in a basic formula the conjecture that the aesthetic  measure is determined by the density of order relations in the aesthetic  object.   The well known aesthetic demand for 'unity in variety' is evidently  closely connected with this formula. The definition of the beautiful as  that which gives us the greatest number of ideas in the shortest space of  time (formulated by Hemsterhuis in the eighteenth century) is of an  analogous nature.   If we admit the validity of such a formula, the following mathematical  formulation of the fundamental aesthetic problem may be made: Within  each class of aesthetic objects, to define the order O and the complexity C  so that their ratio M = O/C yields the aesthetic measure of any object of  the class.   It will be our chief aim to consider various simple classes of aesthetic  objects, and in these cases to solve as best we can the fundamental  aesthetic problem in the mathematical form just stated. Preliminary to  such actual application, however, it is desirable to indicate the psycho  logical basis of the formula and the conditions under which it can be  applied.   4. THE FEELING OF EFFORT IN AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE   From the physiological-psychological point of view, the act of percep  tion of an aesthetic object begins with the stimulation of the auditory or  visual organs of sense, and continues until this stimulation and the re  sultant cerebral excitation terminate. In order that the act of perception  be successfully performed, there is also required the appropriate field of  attention in consciousness. The attentive attitude has of course its physi  ological correlative, which in particular ensures that the motor adjustments  requisite to the act of perception are effected when required. These ad  justments are usually made without the intervention of motor ideas such     Mathematics of Aesthetics 2187   as accompany all voluntary motor acts, and in this sense are 'automatic.'  In more physiological terms, the stimulation sets up a nerve current  which, after reaching the cerebral cortex, in part reverts to the periphery  as a motor nerve current along a path of extreme habituation, such as cor  responds to any automatic act.   Now, although these automatic adjustments are made without the inter  vention of motor ideas, nevertheless there is a well known feeling of effort  or varying tension while the successive adjustments are called for and per  formed. This constitutes a definite and important part of the general feel  ing characteristic of the state of attention. The fact that interest of some  kind is almost necessary for sustained attention would seem to indicate  that this feeling has not a positive (pleasurable) tone but rather a negative  one. Furthermore, if we bear in mind that the so-called automatic acts are  nothing but the outcome of unvarying voluntary acts habitually per  formed, we may reasonably believe that there remain vestiges of the motor  ideas originally involved, and that it is .these which make up this feeling  of effort.   From such a point of view, the feeling of effort always attendant upon  perception appears as a summation of the feelings of tension which accom  pany the various automatic adjustments.   5. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MEANING OF 'COMPLEXITY 7   Suppose that A, B, C, . . . are the various automatic adjustments re  quired, with respective indices of tension a, b, c, . . . , and that these  adjustments A, B,C, . . . take place r, s, t, . . . times respectively. Now  it is the feeling of effort or tension which is the psychological counterpart  of what has been referred to as the complexity C of the aesthetic object.  In this manner we are led to regard the sum of the various indices as the  measure of complexity, and thus to write   C = ra + sb + tc +   A simple illustration may serve to clarify the point of view. Suppose  that we fix attention upon a convex polygonal tile. The act of perception  involved is so quickly performed as to seem nearly instantaneous. The  feeling of effort is almost negligible while the eye follows the successive  sides of the polygon and the corresponding motor adjustments are effected  automatically. Nevertheless, according to the point of view advanced  above, there is a slight feeling of tension attendant upon each adjustment,  and the complexity C will be measured by the number of sides of the  polygon.   Perhaps a more satisfying illustration is furnished by any simple melody.  Here the automatic motor adjustments necessary to the act of perception  are the incipient adjustments of the vocal cords to the successive tones.     George David Birkhoff  21R8   Evidently in this case the complexity C will be measured by the number  of notes in the melody.   6. ASSOCIATIONS AND AESTHETIC FEELING   Up to this point we have only considered the act of perception of an  aesthetic object as involving a certain effort of attention. This feelmg of  effort is correlated with the efferent part of the nerve current which give  rise to the required automatic motor adjustments, and has no direct  reference to aesthetic feeling.   For the cause (physiologically speaking) of aesthetic feelmg, we must  look to that complementary part of the nerve current which, impinging  on the auditory and visual centers, gives rise to sensations derived from  the object, and, spreading from thence, calls various associated ideas with  their attendant feelings into play. These sensations, together with the  associated ideas and their attendant feelings, constitute the full perception  of the object. It is in these associations rather than in the sensations them  selves that we shall find the determining aesthetic factor.   In many cases of aesthetic perception there is more or less complete  identification of the percipient with the aesthetic object. This feelmg of  'empathy/ whose importance has been stressed by the psychologist Lipps, 1  contributes to the enhancement of the aesthetic effect. Similarly, actual  participation on the part of the percipient, as in the case of singing a tune  as well as hearing it, will enhance the effect.   7. THE INTUITIVE NATURE OF SUCH ASSOCIATIONS   Mere verbal associations are irrelevant to the aesthetic experience. In  other words, aesthetic associations are intuitive in type.   When, for instance, I see a symmetrical object, I feel its pleasurable  quality, but do not need to assert explicitly to myself, "How symmetrical!"  This characteristic feature may be explained as follows. In the course of  individual experience it is found generally that symmetrical objects possess  exceptional and desirable qualities. Thus our own bodies are not regarded  as perfectly formed unless they are symmetrical. Furthermore, the visual  and tactual technique by which we perceive the symmetry of various  objects is uniform, highly developed, and almost instantaneously applied.  It is this technique which forms the associative 'pointer.' In consequence  of it, the perception of any symmetrical object is accompanied by an in  tuitive aesthetic feeling of positive tone.   It would even seem to be almost preferable that no verbal association  be made. The unusual effectiveness of more or less occult associations in   1 Asthetik: Psychologic des Schonen und der Kunst, Hamburg and Leipzig, vol. 1  (1903>, vol.2 (1906).     Mathematics of Aesthetics 2189   aesthetic experience is probably due to the fact that such associations are  never given verbal reference.   8. THE ROLE OF SENSUOUS FEELING   The typical aesthetic perception is primarily of auditory or visual type,  and so is not accompanied by stimulation of the end-organs of the so-  called lower senses. Thus the sensuous feeling which enters will be highly  refined. Nevertheless, since sensuous feeling with a slight positive tone  ordinarily accompanies sensations of sight and of sound, it might appear  that such sensuous feeling requires some consideration as part of the  aesthetic feeling. Now, in my opinion, this component can be set aside in  the cases of most interest just because the positive tone of sensuous feel  ing is always present, and in no way differentiates one perception from  another.   For example, all sequences of pure musical tones are equally agreeable  as far as the individual sensations are concerned. Yet some of these se  quences are melodic in quality, while others are not. Hence, although the  agreeableness of the individual sounds forms part of the tone of feeling,  we may set aside this sensuous component when we compare the melodic  quality of various sequences of musical tones.   To support this opinion further, I will take up briefly certain auditory  facts which at first sight appear to be in contradiction with it.   If a dissonant musical interval, such as a semitone, is heard, the re  sultant tone of feeling is negative. Similarly, if a consonant interval like  the perfect fifth is heard, the resultant tone of feeling is positive. But is not  the sensation of a dissonant interval to be considered a single auditory  sensation comparable with that of a consonant interval, and is it not  necessary in this case at least to modify the conclusion as to the constancy  of the sensuous factor?   In order to answer this question, let us recall that musical tones, as  produced either mechanically or by the human voice, contain a pure  fundamental tone of a certain frequency of vibration and pure overtones  of double the frequency (the octave) , of triple the frequency (the octave  of the perfect fifth), etc.; here, with Helmholtz, we regard a pure tone as  the true individual sensation of sound. Thus 'association by contiguity*  operates to connect any tone with its overtones.   If such be the case, a dissonant interval, being made up of two disso  ciated tones, may possess a negative tone of feeling on account of this  dissociation; while the two constituent tones of a consonant interval, being  connected by association through their overtones, may possess a positive  tone of feeling in consequence. Hence the obvious difference in the  aesthetic effect of a consonant and a dissonant musical interval can be  explained on the basis of association alone.     George David Birkhoff  2190   9. FORMAL AND CONNOTATWE ASSOCIATIONS   It is necessary to call attention to a fundamental division of the types  of associations which enter into the aesthetic experience.   Certain kinds of associations are so simple and unitary that they can  be at once denned and their role can be ascertained with accuracy On  the other hand, there are many associations, of utmost importance from  the aesthetic point of view, which defy analysis because they touch our  experience at so many points. The associations of the first type are those  such as symmetry; an instance of the second type would be the associ  ations which are stirred by the meaning of a beautiful poem.   For the purpose of convenient differentiation, associations will be called  'fornial' or 'connotative* according as they are of the first or second type.  There will of course be intermediate possibilities.   More precisely, formal associations are such as involve reference to  some simple physical property of the aesthetic object. Two simple in  stances of these are the following:   rectangle in vertical position - symmetry about vertical;  interval of note and its octave -> consonance.   There is no naming of the corresponding property, which is merely pointed  out, as it were, by the visual or auditory technique involved.   All associations which are not of this simple formal type will be called  connotative.   10. FORMAL AND CONNOTATIVE ELEMENTS OF ORDER   The property of the aesthetic object which corresponds to any associ  ation will be called an 'element of order 1 in the object; and such an ele  ment of order will be called formal or connotative according to the nature  of the association. Thus a formal element of order arises from a simple  physical property such, for instance, as that of consonance in the case of  a musical interval or of symmetry in the case of a geometrical figure.   It is not always the case that the elements of order and the correspond  ing associations are accompanied by a positive tone of feeling. For ex  ample, sharp dissonance is to be looked upon as an element of order with  a negative tone of feeling.   II. TYPES OF FORMAL ELEMENTS OF ORDER   The actual types of formal elements of order which will be met with  are mainly such obvious positive ones as repetition, similarity, contrast,  equality, symmetry, balance, and sequence, each of which takes many  forms. These are in general to be reckoned as positive in their effect.     Mathematics of Aesthetics 2191   Furthermore there is a somewhat less obvious positive element of order,  due to suitable centers of interest or repose, which plays a role. For ex  ample, a painting should have one predominant center of interest on which  the eye can rest; similarly in Western music it is desirable to commence  in the central tonic chord and to return to this center at the end.   On the other hand, ambiguity, undue repetition, and unnecessary im  perfection are formal elements of order which are of strongly negative  type. A rectangle nearly but not quite a square is unpleasantly ambiguous;  a poem overburdened with alliteration and assonance fatigues by undue  repetition; a musical performance in which a single wrong note is heard is  marred by the unnecessary imperfection.   12. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MEANING OF 'ORDER*   We are now prepared to deal with the order O of the aesthetic object  in a manner analogous to that used in dealing with the complexity C.   Let us suppose that associations of various types L, M, N, . . . take  place with respective indices of tone of feeling /, m, n, . . . In this case  the indices may be positive, zero, or negative, according as the correspond  ing tones of feeling are positive, indifferent, or negative. If the associations,  L, M, N, . . . occur u, v, w, . . . times respectively, then we may regard  the total tone of feeling as a summational effect represented by the sum  ul + vm + .   This effect is the psychological counterpart of what we have called the  order O of the aesthetic object, inasmuch as L, M\ N, . . . correspond to  what have been termed the elements of order in the aesthetic object. Thus  we are led to write   O = ul 4- vm + wn 4-   By way of illustration, let us suppose that we have before us various  polygonal tiles in vertical position. What are the elements of order and  the corresponding associations which determine the feeling of aesthetic  value accompanying the act of perception of such a tile? Inasmuch as a  detailed study of polygonal form is made in the next chapter, we shall  merely mention three obvious positive elements of order, without making  any attempt to choose indices. If a tile is symmetric about a vertical axis,  the vertical symmetry is felt pleasantly. Again, a tile may have symmetry  of rotation; a square tile, for example, has this property, for it can be  rotated through a right angle without affecting its position. Such symmetry  of rotation is also appreciated immediately. Lastly, if the sides of a tile  fall along a rectangular network, as in the case of a Greek cross, the  relation to the network is felt agreeably.     George David Birkhoff  2192   13. THE CONCEPT OF AESTHETIC MEASURE   The aesthetic measure U of a class of aesthetic objects is primarily any  quantitative index of their comparative aesthetic effectiveness.   It is impossible to compare objects of different types, as we observed  at the outset. Who, for instance, would attempt to compare a vase with a  melody? In fact, for comparison to be possible, such classes must be  severely restricted, Thus it is futile to compare a painting in oils with one  in water colors, except indirectly, by the comparison of each with the best  examples of its type; to be sure, the two paintings might be compared in  respect to composition alone, by means of photographic reproduction. On  the other hand, photographic portraits of the same person are readily com  pared and arranged in order of preference.   But even when the class is sufficiently restricted, the preferences of dif  ferent individuals will vary according to their taste and aesthetic experi  ence Moreover the preference of an individual will change somewhat  from time to time. Thus such aesthetic comparison, of which the aesthetic  measure M is the determining index, will have substantial meaning only  when it represents the normal or average judgment of some selected group  of observers. For example, in the consideration of Western music it would  be natural to abide by the consensus of opinion of those who are familiar   with it. .   Consequently the concept of aesthetic measure M is applicable only  if the class of objects is so restricted that direct intuitive comparison of  the different objects becomes possible, in which case the arrangement in  order of aesthetic measure represents the aesthetic judgment of an ideal  ized 'normal observer.'   14. THE BASIC FORMULA   If our earlier analysis be correct, it is the intuitive estimate of the amount  of order O inherent in the aesthetic object, as compared with its com  plexity C, from which arises the derivative feeling of the aesthetic measure  M of the different objects of the class considered. We shall first make an  argument to this effect on the basis of an analogy, and then proceed to a  more purely mathematical argument.   The analogy will be drawn from the economic field. Among business  enterprises of a single definite type, which shall be held the most success  ful? The usual answer would take the following form. In each business  there is involved a certain investment i and a certain annual profit p. The  ratio p/i, which represents the percentage of interest on the investment, is  regarded as the economic measure of success.   Similarly in the perception of aesthetic objects belonging to a definite  class, there is involved a feeling of effort of attention, measured by C,     Mathematics of Aesthetics 2193   which is rewarded by a certain positive tone of feeling, measured by O.  It is natural that reward should be proportional to effort, as in the case  of a business enterprise. By analogy, then, it is the ratio O/C which best  represents the aesthetic measure M .   15. A MATHEMATICAL ARGUMENT   More mathematically, but perhaps not more convincingly, we can argue  as follows. In the first place it must be supposed that if two objects of  the class have the same order O and the same complextiy C, their aesthetic  measures are to be regarded as the same. Hence we may write   M = f(0,C)   and thus assert that the aesthetic measure depends functionally upon O  and C alone.   It is obvious that if we increase the order without altering the com  plexity, or if we diminish the complexity without altering the order, the  value of M should be increased. But these two laws do not serve to de  termine the function /.   In order to do so, we imagine the following hypothetical experiment.  Suppose that we have before us a certain set of k objects of the class, all  having the same order O and the same complexity C, and also a second  set of // objects of the class, all having the order O f and complexity O.  Let us choose k and k? so that k'C' equals kC.   Now proceed as follows. Let all of the first set of objects be observed,  one after the other; the total effort will be measured by kC of course, and  the total tone of aesthetic feeling by kO. Similarly let all of the second  set be observed. The effort will be the same as before, since k'C' equals  kC; and the total tone of feeling will be measured by k'O*.   If the aesthetic measure of the individual objects of the second class is  the same as of the first, it would appear inevitable that the total tone of  feeling must be the same in both cases, so that k'O f equals kO. With this  granted, we conclude at once that the ratios O'/C f and O/C are the same.  In conseauence the aesthetic measure only depends upon the ratio O to C:   M = f(-\     The final step can now be taken. Since it is not the actual numerical  magnitude of / that is important but only the relative magnitude when  we order according to aesthetic measure, and since M must increase with  O/C, we can properly define M as equal to the ratio of O to C.   It is obvious that the aesthetic measure M as thus determined is zero  (M = 0) when the tone of feeling due to the associated ideas is indifferent.     George David Birkhoff  2194   16. THE SCOPE OF THE FORMULA   As presented above, the basic formula admits of theoretic application  to any properly restricted class of aesthetic objects.   Now it would seem not to be difficult in any case to devise a reason  able and simple measure of the complexity C of the aesthetic objects of  the class. On the other hand, the order O must take account of all types  of associations induced by the objects, whether formal or connotative;  and a suitable index is to be assigned to each. Unfortunately the connota  tive elements of order cannot be so treated, since they are of inconceivable  variety and lie beyond the range of precise analysis.   It is clear then that complete quantitative application of the basic  formula can only be effected when the elements of order are mainly  formal Of course it is always possible to consider the formula only in so  far as the formal elements of order are concerned, and to arrive in this  way at a partial application.   Consequently our attention will be directed almost exclusively towards  the formal side of art, to which alone the basic formula of aesthetic  measure can be quantitatively applied. Our first and principal aim will be  to effect an analysis in typical important cases of the utmost simplicity.  From the vantage point so reached it will be possible to consider briefly  more general questions. In following this program, there is of course no  intention of denying the transcendent importance of the connotative side  in all creative art.   17. A DIAGRAM   The adjoining diagram with the attached legend may be of assistance  in recalling the above analysis of the aesthetic experience and the basic  aesthetic formula to which it leads.   18. THE METHOD OF APPLICATION   Even in the most favorable cases, the precise rules adopted for the  determination of 0, C, and thence of the aesthetic measure M, are neces  sarily empirical. In fact the symbols O and C represent social values, and  share in the uncertainty common to such values. For example, the *pur-  chasing power of money' can only be determined approximately by means  of empirical rules, and yet the concept involved is of fundamental  economic importance.   At the same time it should be added that this empirical method seems  to be the only one by which concepts of this general category can be  approached scientifically.   We shall endeavor at all times to choose formal elements of order hav-     Mathematics of Aesthetics 2195     DIAGRAM OF THE AESTHETIC FORMULA     Field of attention in cerebrum   /Field of aesthetic 1 _ / Field of \   1 associations f * - \ sensation f  V, ) \ t >     _., , -  Field of     Sensory nerve current    Motor nerve current of  automatic adjustment J.

PART XXII   Mathematics of the Good     1. A Mathematical Approach to Ethics   by GEORGE DAVID BIRKHOFF     Philosopher, count about two hundred and eighty-eight view of t   - TASCAL   eign good.     1 A Mathematical Approach to  Ethics   By GEORGE DAVID BIRKHOFF     SINCE the time of the German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, it has been  clear that, for certain purposes, philosophic thought may be treated sepa  rately in its logical, aesthetic, and ethical aspects, concerned respectively  with the true, the beautiful, and the good.   In the last century logic has developed into an independent discipline  the edifice of syllogistic thought of which all of mathematics appears  as the grandiose superstructure.   The concept of "aesthetic measure" which I laid before you in 1932  made possible a more or less mathematical treatment of aesthetics giving  promise of taking the subject of analytical aesthetics out of the domain of  philosophic speculation into the region of common sense thought. The  question thus presents itself almost irresistibly to the mind: Is not a similar  treatment of analytic ethics possible? My aim here is to show that such a  program seems to be feasible.   To most mathematicians the tendency towards increasing mathemati-  zation in these three fundamental aspects of philosophic thought logic,  aesthetics, and ethics is only what was to be expected; for they are likely  to agree with the dictum of the great French philosopher and mathema  tician, Rene Descartes, omnia apud me mathematica fiunt with me  everything turns into mathematics!   Even in early Greek times the philosopher Pythagoras tried to bring  mathematical order into the ethical field by asserting that justice is repre  sented by a square number. This must be looked upon as a mystical con  jecture of real importance for ethics. Similarly Plato and Aristotle were  always desirous of showing the close relationship of the good and the  beautiful, if not their essential identity; and they regarded the beautiful  as characterized by unity in variety. Thus, there has always been observa  ble in ethics, as well as in aesthetics, a tendency towards quantitative  formulation. The supreme goal of the summum bonum or highest good,  adopted by the Greeks, is suggestive of this; and the modern utilitarian  principle of "the greatest good of the greatest number" reveals still more  clearly the same tendency.     2198     A Mathematical Approach to Ethics 2199   A very interesting analogy between aesthetics and ethics is the follow  ing. Individuals of so-called artistic temperament often look upon their  personal experiences as a succession of aesthetic adventures from which  they try to extract the greatest possible enjoyment. Similarly, persons of  predominantly moralistic type strive for a maximum of moral satisfaction  by making in their daily lives such ethical decisions as will best promote  the material and spiritual well-being of their fellows.   Just as the analysis of experience from the aesthetic point of view yields  the concept of "aesthetic measure" the ratio of aesthetic reward to effort  of attention as basic in the evaluation of aesthetic pleasure, so the con  sideration of experience in its ethical aspects leads to an analogous  concept of "ethical measure" the amount of moral satisfaction based on  good accomplished.   The simple ethical formula evidently suggested is:   M (ethical measure) G (total good achieved).   From this point of view the ethically-minded person 1 endeavors always  to select that one of the possible courses of action which maximizes the  ethical measure G, just as the aesthetically-minded person continually  compares aesthetic objects and prefers those which maximize the aesthetic  measure O/C. 2 The utilitarian calculus of Jeremy Bentham represents a  suggestive semi-philosophical attempt in the same direction. 3   Let us consider a little more in detail this general parallelism between  the aesthetic and ethical domains. In order to do this the use of parallel  columns is convenient.

A. Samuelson of the Society of Fellows of Harvard  University calls my attention to F. Y. Somhworth's very interesting volume on  Mathematical Psychics (1881).     2200   In aesthetics, objects of a definite  class are to be compared in regard  to their relative aesthetic measures  Af. Such classes are of extraordi  nary variety. The theory of aesthet  ic measure is best exemplified by  certain simple formal visual and  auditory fields, provided by art  rather than by nature.   Artists, connoisseurs, and critics  of all kinds are considered to be  especially competent judges in their  special aesthetic fields. But the ag  gregate opinion of ordinary lay ob  servers plays a vital role.   Aesthetic tastes vary from one  individual to another, and are rela  tive to the period and culture con  cerned. Nevertheless there is a  certain grand parallelism to be  discerned, due to the presence of  certain absolute elements of order,  as, for instance, rhythm in music.  Cultivated human beings are gener  ally able to understand and appre  ciate aesthetic objects of all kinds  and periods.   Finally, the main phases in the  history of aesthetic ideas and liter  ary criticism of special artistic  forms can be concisely interpreted  by use of the concept of aesthetic  measure.     George David Birkhoff   In ethics, each single definite  problem is to be considered by it  self, and the possible solutions are  compared as to their ethical meas  ures, M. These problems are also of  extraordinary variety. The main in  terest in ethics is provided by prob  lems arising in practice rather than  by artificial problems.   Religious leaders, statesmen, judg  es, and the socially elect are  regarded as the best judges in their  several ethical fields. But the gen  eral intuitive opinion of mankind  often has decisive weight.   Ethical values and ideals vary in  a similar manner. Nevertheless,  there are always to be found certain  absolute elements of the good as,  for instance, bravery and loyalty in  their socially validated forms. Care  ful study of the development of  such specific forms serves to explain  them acceptably to men every  where as varied manifestations of  these absolute elements of the good.   Similarly, the main phases in the  history of ethical ideas and of their  many special social manifestations  admit of concise interpretation  through the concept of ethical  measure.     Having called attention to this significant general parallelism between  aesthetics and ethics, I propose to consider some specific problems which  illustrate how the concept of ethical measure can be used. I make no  apologies for the simple character of the ideas involved, since it is inevi  table that the initial results obtained be rudimentary. As possibly sugges  tive in this connection, it may be recalled that the first classification of  matter as solid, liquid, or gaseous provided a crude trifurcation of nature,  which ultimately led to the mathematical theories of elasticity and hydro  dynamics.   Problem I. A bus driver regularly takes passengers from the starting  point A to their destinations along the main road from A to M and along  certain side roads on one side of the main road. The majority of the pas  sengers live along the main road, and the side roads are short. The driver  wishes to be as accommodating as possible and to give all the passengers  equal consideration. In what order should he take the passengers to their  destinations?  His decision is always to deliver the passengers in the natural order of     A Mathematical Approach to Ethics 2201     ABDEGHJKL ftf   going from A to M along the main road. To justify this decision he might  argue as follows:   Suppose first that all the passengers on some trip wished to alight at  poults on the main route, as not infrequently was the case. If he took  them to their destinations in other than the natural order, the series of  passengers (as a series) would be less quickly delivered one by one than  otherwise, i.e., the first passenger would alight later, the second passenger  also, etc. Since all the passengers are to be treated as well as possible, this  would be regarded as extremely objectionable by them. But in the event  that some of the passengers wish to alight along the short side roads, the  additional times required are very small and in the driver's judgment do  not need to be considered. Hence he finds that the delivery of passengers  should always be as stated.   Let us attempt to formalize this simple reasoning. The underlying good  here, G, may be regarded here as negative ( ), if we reckon upon the un  realizable good of immediate delivery of the passengers as the neutral  point (0) from which the reckoning starts. Thus we write   G (sum of all the trip-durations for the passengers).   The possible solutions to be considered are the various ways of taking  the passengers to their destinations.   The two basic assumptions of the driver are almost but not entirely in  agreement with this definition of G; they are: (1) the individual trip-  durations along the main road are to be diminished as far as possible;  (2) the trip-durations along the side roads need not be considered. On this  basis his decision is obviously as stated and in general will maximize the  good, G, as just defined.   However, there might occasionally arise situations in which this solution  was not actually the best one by the formula written above. Suppose, for  example, there were six passengers, one to be delivered at C, and five at >,  with equal distances AB, EC, and BD (see the figure above). Clearly the  'best' solution in this exceptional case would be to deliver the five pas  sengers at D along the main road, and then to return along the main road  and deliver the remaining passenger at C. In fact, if the driver follows his  general rule, we have     George David Birkhofi  2202   G = -22a,   where a stands for the time required for the bus to go over any one of the  equal distances, while if the driver were to deliver his passengers in the  reverse order, we would have     so that 8a units of time would be thereby saved to the passengers.   Nevertheless, the driver decides to deliver the passengers in the usual  way. In doing so he goes directly against a perfectly natural postulate re  ferred to above, namely, that if he can shorten (or in no case lengthen)  the trip-durations of the successive passengers, he certainly should do so.   Obviously the naturalness and uniformity of the solution adopted by  him operates as an important factor in its favor. For the rule of procedure  chosen by the driver is readily understood by the passengers and any  modification of it in the direction of increased complication might lead to  dissatisfaction, especially because the time-schedules of the trip would  become even more unpredictable.   Thus we are led to realize that there are instances in which the sim  plicity and elegance of the solution of an ethical problem must itself be  regarded as one of the imponderable elements of the good which enter  into G.   There is a kind of counterpart to this phenomenon in the aesthetic field:  Apparently the intuitive aesthetic judgment tends through an inner neces  sity to prefer formally simple elements of order in the aesthetic object.   Our second problem is intended to present a very different type of  ethical situation which is of high significance, and which involves both  material and immaterial elements of the good. Though presented in a spe  cialized form, I believe that the problem selected embodies a situation  characteristic of critical moments in the lives of many human beings  moments when the choice must be made between material good with  attendant failure in loyalty, on the one hand, or the sacrifice of this mate  rial gain with preservation of loyalty, on the other. As has been indicated  previously, a complete quantitative treatment cannot be hoped for in such  a problem.   Problem II. One or the other of two friends of long standing, A and B,  is to be advanced to an opening in the organization in which they hold  positions of the same rank. A happens to learn that the actual selection  will hinge upon the judgment of a certain person L belonging to the same  organization. Ought A to pass this information on to Bl   The answer of course is that in the circumstances stated A ought to in  form his friend B.  A*s reasons for this decision might be formalized as follows: The mate-     A Mathematical Approach to Ethics 2203   rial goods g A and g B which will accrue to him or to his friend through  such an advancement are the same: g A g n g. If A informs B, the im  material good of his friendship, /, with A is retained. Therefore, we have  simply     On the other hand, if A does not tell B what he has learned, the friend  ship between them is destroyed, even if B never learns of A's unfriendly  act; and so we have     Since g exceeds g /, A ought to tell B, although he realizes that by doing  so he gives up a definite personal advantage. In the above reckoning the  unfavorable effect upon A*s character of not informing B is intentionally  disregarded although it might really be the most important consideration  of all.   A's decision to pass on the information to B is here assumed to be made  on the utilitarian basis. On a hedonistic basis, A might conclude that if he  fails to inform B, then     since he will be certain to win L's special favor, whereas, in the contrary  case,   8   Af = -,  2   inasmuch as he would then only have an equal chance with B. In this  event, he would have to balance the prospect of material advancement  against his friendship with B.   Again, according to the extent that A believes himself inferior to B,  he will feel that his chances are lessened by telling B. If A is a loyal friend,  however, he will not be moved from his decision by such thoughts.   The basic hypothesis has been made here that the information about L  is of legitimate practical advantage to A and B. It is also assumed that the  friendship between A and B is a sincere one, founded upon mutual esteem.  For clearly if there were no real friendship, A would not be under any  obligation to inform B, any more than he would consider it an obligation  on 5's part to tell him. Of course if A believes that B would not tell him  if circumstances were reversed, or that B would employ unfair or un  scrupulous tactics to gain L's favor, the bond of friendship between them  is already weak; and so the situation would not be the one envisaged in  the problem under consideration.     George David Btrkhoff  2204   A somewhat similar type of problem, also not infrequently exemplified  in human experience, is the following:   Problem II L Two men, A and B, among six, A, B, C, D, E, F in con  trol of a certain business, have orally agreed to exchange all relevant  information before entering into any arrangement with the others. A and  B do this in order to protect their interests in the business. A is approached  confidentially by C, D, E, and F, and asked if he will concur in a vote  giving him important special privileges which are to be withheld from B.  Actually A does not feel he is entitled to these special privileges any more  than B is. How ought A to act?   The ethical course for A to follow is clearly to refuse to connive with  C, />, E, and F. He should further inform C, D, E, and F that in his  opinion to do otherwise would not be fair to B.   If A acts in this manner we may write   Af = 0,   meaning thereby that the status quo ante is not altered. If A consents to  their proposal, we may write for A   M = g A -f- e B ,   meaning that A gains the privileges mentioned (g A ), loses 5's friendship  (/), and possibly incurs B's positive enmity (e B ) 9 fraught with danger to  him for instance, the enmity of B might lead to his loss of a valuable  reputation for business integrity. Here we find in G two elements of  mainly material nature (g A , e B ) and one of immaterial nature (/).   The two preceding problems have been taken from the field of social  ethics. It is of interest that similar problems can be drawn from the field  of international ethics. In the problem about to be stated there is no inten  tion to parallel closely any actual problem. The intention is rather to sug  gest that there may exist somewhat analogous problems which admit of  clarification when approached from the point of view of ethical measure.   Problem IV. As the result of a war, B has lost a colony C to the nation  A. This colony C has subsequently been given nearly complete independ  ence by A. This action leaves C well satisfied with her status and favor  ably disposed towards A. However, B has an economic need for her  former colony C, by reason of lack of raw materials which C had formerly  supplied; and for this and other more political reasons, B demands the  cession of C back to her by A. How is A to reply to the demand?   A reasonable analysis on A's part might be the following: A concludes  that to return the colony C would not only be objectionable to C but ex  tremely detrimental to A's international standing and prestige as a con  cession under duress. Furthermore, A feels that if she did agree to B's  demand, other similar demands reinforced by further military threats     A Mathematical Approach to Ethics 2205   would soon follow. Thus A (and C) might write in the event of return  of C to B     (where g B = material good to B; h A>c = material and immaterial harm to  A and C) and, in the contrary case,   M = 0,   since there is no reason to believe that the prospect of ultimate war is  effectively lessened. Hence A and C would have to balance 5's good  against their own harm; and so A would almost certainly refuse to cede  C back to B.   From B's standpoint, however, the analysis in the case of cession would  more correctly be   M = g B + P,   (where p good of peace), since B would not admit that A or C would  suffer much economic loss thereby, nor that there could be enduring peace  without cession; and B's analysis in the contrary case would be     Thus the balance in favor of cession is g B 4- p in J5's estimate, and at least  ^A 3 c SB against cession in A and C's estimate. Thus there is a very  serious conflict of ethical judgment. Such a situation naturally raises the  question of possible compromise.   In this and similar cases of apparent conflict in ethical judgments the  thorough exploration of all possibilities of compromise is absolutely es  sential.   The following is a suggestion of a possibility of such a compromise in  this particular case: A notifies B and C that hi recognition of B's economic  needs and of her claims, she will henceforth not accept from her colony  C any more favorable trade status than C accords to B.   There is then the possibility that despite A's refusal of B's demand for  the return of C to her, B can recover a substantial portion of her former  trade with C. Thus one might write, in behalf of all the three parties A, B,  and C, a formula such as     in the event of such a compromise, as against M = if the status quo ante  is preserved. The sole loss for A would be loss of an estimated quarter of  B's trade with her (%g A ); B would recover an estimated half of her  former trade with C (%g B ) without loss to C; and it might be that the  resultant improvement in the friendliness of relations between A and B     George David Birkhoff  2206   would increase the likelihood of a permanent peace and so slow down the  expensive armament race between A and B (Vzp) .   The question of compromise is extremely important in many ethical  problems. Is it reasonable to suppose that such compromises can generally  be reached? In this connection I recall a conversation with Dean Roscoe  Pound and Count Korzybski some years ago. Count Korzybski had ex  pressed the opinion that many conflicts of points of view had their origin  mainly in misunderstandings as to the meaning of terms, so that the con  flict would disappear as soon as these meanings were agreed upon. I  replied that in many disputes the situation resembled rather that arising  between two boys contending for a single piece of pie; and Dean Pound  was inclined to agree with me. In the tragic condition of the world today,  the suggestion might be made that if the division of the single piece of pie  into two equal pieces were made (a reasonable compromise), both boys  could be induced to accept their portion! . . .   In my judgment it would be a very constructive program for analytic  ethics, to catalogue systematically various significant problems in the three  fields of procedural ethics, social ethics, and international ethics, and to  classify the main types of solutions on the basis of the formula for ethical  measure.   This has been attempted to a very rudimentary extent in the special   problems above.   More specifically, social customs and systems of law and of religion  contain a vast mass of ethical data, embodying the accepted ethical solu  tions of innumerable practical problems of analytic ethics; and the induc  tive method can generally be applied to treat new problems when they  arise. In so far as these solutions are not purely empirical, they could be  codified by means of the ethical formula. Such a codification would list  and classify the very extensive variety of ethical intuitions (postulates),  in part the cause of, and in part the result of, specific social interactions.  There is little doubt of the basic role which the sentiments of love, good  will, loyalty, and other feelings of sensuous, aesthetic, or intellectual type  play in such intuitions. These provide a substratum of absolute elements,  of which the specific manifestation depends on the particular culture and  period concerned.   Another useful service of such a program might be to treat the ex  tremely interesting history of ethical ideas by use of the same ethical  formula. Thus the early Greek conception of ethical behavior as directed  towards the attainment of the summum bonum is evidently in consonance  with the ethical formula. The customary threefold division of ethical  theories into those of hedonistic (or egoistic) type, of utilitarian (or uni-  versalistic) type, and of altruistic type is immediately explained in the  same way; for if G/ denotes the good of an individual and G F the good     A Mathematical Approach to Ethics 2207   of his fellows, then the three types of ethical theory correspond to the re  spective formulas: M = G It M = G/ + G F , M = G F respectively. It is  hardly necessary to say that in promulgating a theory which is (sup  posedly) of the first or last non-utilitarian type, it is frequently necessary  to rob Peter to pay Paul!   Many ethical theorists have tended to take the good and the pleasurable  as synonymous; thus, according to Bentham, pleasures differ quantitatively  but not qualitatively. From our point of view, this is a necessary assump  tion if all the constituents of the good in G are looked upon as comparable  quantities, as required by the ethical formula.   Some have regarded the striving for perfection as supremely important,  thereby emphasizing the achievement of potential good as the final goal;  this reaches far into the domain of the qualitative application of the ethical  formula.   Still others, like Kant, insist upon the dominating role of the sense of  duty as the "categorical imperative." This validates the innumerable ethi  cal intuitions on which concrete decisions concerning the immaterial good  must always depend. Through the sense of duty we feel that it is possible  to distinguish clearly between right and wrong, independently of our par  ticular backgrounds, although careful analysis reveals that this independ  ence is by no means complete. In fact the formalization of such intuitions,  combined with the use of the general ethical formula, leads to the analytic  solution of ethical problems by means of reasoning a point of view going  back to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.   There is a further reason why the systematic codification of ethical  notions might be of genuine service. Ordinary language provides a vast  storehouse of convenient symbols, which (as has been recently empha  sized) often bring together under one name a number of quite different  entities. For example, we speak of "fatigue" with a good deal of certainty.  But what is fatigue? There are specific conditions of fatigue of the muscles,  of special nerves, etc.; but what have they in common? Careful experi  mentation, systematic analysis, and detailed classification are necessary  for the proper elucidation of this question. This has indeed been accom  plished recently by Professor L. J. Henderson and his colleagues in the  Harvard Fatigue Laboratory; and the final upshot is that "fatigue" desig  nates not one thing but many, grouped together largely because of intel  lectual convenience. Of course the notion of fatigue has no immediate  ethical import.   Now many of the terms used constantly in ethical discussions have an  even less definite meaning, and frequently provide a convenient emotional  support for ethical or unethical action. Certain of these general terms,  such as "wisdom" and "justice" seem to be mainly constructive in their  effect, but others, like "racial superiority," for example, are positively     220$ George David Birkhoff   destructive and dangerous, unless their various meanings have been made  very specific. For instance, in speaking of racial superiority, which of the  qualities listed below do we regard as really characteristic? Physical  prowess and beauty; racial purity; descent from divine ancestors; intel  lectual capacity and achievement; aesthetic sensibility and artistic creative-  ness; unselfish idealism; unlimited devotion to the state; economic efficiency;  military might; high potentiality of further development? Evidently there  are many consistent points of view as to what constitutes "racial superi  ority*'; and so wherever the idea is used it needs to be properly defined  and accurately applied in the selected sense.   Our thought here is akin to that of Korzybski, that when human beings  realize that certain important general terms have a variety of distinct  meanings, the effect of this realization is definitely prophylactic against  misunderstanding, prejudice, and intolerance. If the clarification of such  important but multiple-valued ideas is not effected soon, the present tragic  confusion among men may end in the destruction of civilization.   Such is the general program for ethics to which I desire to direct atten  tion. It is analogous in many respects to that which I have attempted to  carry out provisionally in aesthetics. The program involves the introduc  tion of elementary quantitative ideas based on a simple formula for  "ethical measure" in order to clarify and codify the vast ethical domain.  Conceivably such a program might perform the same kind of useful  service for ethics as elementary logic performs for mathematics, and  grammar for language.

Inflexible Logic by RUSSELL MALONEY   5. The Law by ROBERT M. COATES     COMMENTARY ON   The Island of Laputa     CAPTAIN LEMUEL GULLIVER'S voyage to the Flying Island, La  puta, is the longest part of Swift's marvelous book, but in originality,  inventiveness and persuasiveness of satire, it is inferior to the other  voyages. At times, indeed, the reader of Laputa wishes that Gulliver might  just once complete a voyage without mishap.   Gulliver's Travels was published in October, 1726. The "chief end" of  all his labors, Swift had written to Pope the year before, was "to vex the  world rather than divert it," l The world chose to be diverted. From the  first the Travels were enormously successful; the first edition sold out in a  week, and the book "received the immediate compliment of wide imitation  and translation." 2 Laputa, however, was condemned as uninspired and  even imitative. Sharp-eyed readers noticed that some of its details and  situations were copied from other books, in particular from one of the  classic "fantastic voyages," the True History of the Roman writer Lucian,  whose works Swift had read in translation. 3 But the fact that Swift bor  rowed is generally known and has earned him little criticism in connection  with the other voyages. The real objection in the case of Laputa is that he  borrowed to poor effect. In a joint letter to Swift a month after Gulliver  appeared, Pope and Gay reported a widely held opinion: "As to other  critics they think the flying island is the least entertaining; and so great an  opinion the town have of the impossibility of Gulliver's writing below  himself, it is agreed that part was not writ by the same hand." 4 Many  modern critics have echoed this view, declaring that Laputa is not to be  compared with the rest of the Travels, that it lacks unity and that its satire  is forced and of only contemporary interest.   This disparagement is too severe. Laputa is not as fascinating as Lilliput  or Brobdingnag or as powerful as the voyage to the Houyhnhnms; but it  is by no means devoid of the superlative literary and philosophic qualities  that have won for the Travels a place among the masterpieces of imagina  tion and social commentary. "There is a pedantry in manners, as in all   1 September 29, 1725, This is the famous letter that continues: "I have ever hated  all nations, professions, and communities, and all my love is toward individuals: for  instance I hate the tribe of lawyers, but I love Counsellor Such-a-one, and Judge  Such-a-one: so with physicians 1 will not speak of my own trade soldiers, English,  Scotch, French, and the rest. But principally I hate and detest that animal called man,  although I heartily love John, Peter, Thomas, and so forth."   * Gulliver's Travels, etc., edited by William Alfred Eddy, New York, 1933; from  the introduction by Eddy, p. 1 .   3 William A.

The Laputians, at least those  of "better Quality," are mathematicians, astrologers and musicians, so  wrapped up in their speculations as to be clumsily unfit for the simplest  practical tasks. Their food is served in geometrical shapes and tastes as flat  as a plane; their houses are "very ill built" because of "the Contempt they  bear for practical Geometry, which they despise as vulgar and mechanick";  their clothes, measured by tailors who use a quadrant, ruler and compass,  are "very ill-made and quite out of shape." Altogether, they are an "awk  ward and unhandy people," opinionated, "very bad Reasoners" and live  in perpetual fear that the earth will collide with a comet or be swallowed  by the sun or suffer some other celestial calamity. On the neighboring  continent of Balnibarbi, in the metropolis, Lagado, is an Academy of Pro  jectors whose scientists and philosophers spend their time in such pursuits  as writing treatises on the malleability of fire, "contriving a new method  for building Houses, by beginning at the Roof, and working downwards  to the Foundation," and extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers. There is  also a mathematical school where Gulliver sees the master teach his pupils  "after a Method scarce imaginable to us in Europe. The Proposition and  Demonstration were fairly written on a thin Wafer, with Ink composed of  a Cephalick Tincture. This the Student was to swallow upon a fasting  Stomach, and for three Days following eat nothing but Bread and Water.  As the Wafer digested, the Tincture mounted to his Brain, bearing the  Proposition along with it." For various reasons this method failed of its  purpose.   So far as the other voyages are concerned, it is clear whom Swift meant  to ridicule, the foibles and follies he wished to expose. Laputa's target is  less obvious. Why was Swift so acutely roiled by mathematicians and  natural scientists in a period when mathematics was being enriched by  major discoveries, when mathematical physics, a field first opened up by  Galileo, Huygens and Newton, was being systematically extended, and  when the experimental sciences were flourishing in almost every depart  ment? It is hard to think of a time when science was more lively and  creative, more widely and justly esteemed.   Laputa cannot be explained merely by ascribing it to the "great founda  tion of misanthropy" upon which Swift said he had erected "the whole  building" of his Travels', to his "perfect rage and resentment" (his own  words) against practically everyone for practically everything. Nor can it  be asserted that Swift, though he admitted "little acquaintance with mathe  matical knowledge," was either ignorant of the contemporary ferment in   s A Treatise on Good Manners and Good Breeding in the Prose Works of Jonathan  Swift, DD. 9 XL, 81. (Bohn's Standard Library, 1897-1911, ed. by Temple Scott)     Editor's Comment   scientific thought or indifferent to it. Interest in scientific discoveries was  widespread among English and French men of letters during the seven  teenth and eighteenth centuries. Swift, as recent researches show, not only  shared this fashionable interest but was impelled by scientific curiosity to  dig deeper. 6 Through his friendship with men engaged in scientific work,  notably the admirable Dr. Arbuthnot, and by carefully reading the Trans  actions of the Royal Society, he learned to distinguish the honest men  from the fakers and dilettantes.   The Transactions were a remarkable mixture of nonsense and sober  ideas; of magic, mathematics, fantasy, experimental fact, foolishness, logic  and pedantry. Swift scanned the contributions with a "humorously critical  eye," and with the deliberate purpose of gathering material for his  writings. Diligent and ingenious scholars have traced almost everything  in Laputa to contemporary science and to certain prevalent popular re  actions to scientific doctrines and discoveries. There were discussions in  the Transactions of comets and strange voyages; the analogy between  music and mathematics was treated by the famous English mathematician  John Wallis (1616-1703) and by one of the virtuosos, the Rev. T. Sal  mon, in a paper called "The Theory of Musick Reduced to Arithmetical  and Geometrical Progressions." The Rev. T. Salmon was, I believe, an  Englishman, but his interests were evidently identical with those of the  wise men of Laputa. 7 The Laputian dread of the sun and of comets was  also widespread in the eighteenth century. Having begun to accept New  ton's clockwork universe, men were haunted by fear that the clockwork  might get out of order. Halley had predicted the return of his comet in  1758; no one could be certain he was right, much less that it might not  succumb to a churlish whim and bump into the earth. 8 Realization that  the stability of the earth's orbit depended "on a nice balance between the  velocity with which the earth is falling toward the sun and its tangential  velocity at right angles to that fall" did not unduly disturb the handful of  mathematicians and astronomers who understood what this equilibrium  meant. But there were many others, of weaker faith in arithmetic and  geometry, who would have preferred a less precarious arrangement. The  Grand Academy in the metropolis of Lagado has been identified as  Gresham College in London, where the Royal Society for many years   6 Two leading papers on this subject are Marjorie Nicholson and Nora Mohler,  "The Scientific Background of Swift's Voyages to Laputa," Annals of Science, Vol. 2,  1937; and George Reuben Potter, "Swift and Natural Science," Philological Quarterly,  Vol. 20, April, 1941.   7 Nicholson and Mohler, op. cit., Note 6 above.   8 One of the Laputians' anxieties was that since the "Earth very narrowly escaped  a brush from the tail of the last comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to  ashes," the next, "which they have calculated for One and Thirty years hence, will  probably destroy us." Note that "one and thirty years" from 1726, the date of publi  cation of the Travels, is 1757; Halley predicted the return of the comet in 1758. See  Nicholson and Mohler, op. cit, y p. 310.     The Island of Laputa 221 3   held its meetings, had its library and museum. The Projectors of the  Academy dominated their nation as the members of the Royal Society  dominated England. 9 Many more examples could be given of the deriva  tion of Laputa from circumstances of the eighteenth-century scientific  scene, as well as from earlier works of fantasy.   It is true, as Whitehead has said, that Swift lived at a time "peculiarly  unfitted for gibes at contemporary mathematics." 10 It is also true that in  Laputa, as in the other voyages, Swift exhibits complex and to some extent  contradictory emotions. He detested fakers and fools whether their spe  cialty was geometry or politics. He lashed out at pride in every sphere of  human affairs. At the same time he treasured human excellence and with  characteristic fervor valued high moral and rational qualities wherever he  found them. 11 It is fair to say, I think, that Swift was both enormously  impressed by science and contemptuous of it; aware of its importance in  human affairs and insensitive to the usefulness of useless knowledge. Like  other writers of his age Butler, Shadwell, Addison he ridiculed the im-  practicality of mathematics. This was partly justified, partly the result of  his essential ignorance of the subject itself. If he had been more of a  mathematician he would perhaps have been less contemptuous, or, at any  rate, more discriminating in his ridicule. But if he had been more of a  mathematician it is doubtful he would have written Gulliver.   9 Nicholson and Mohler, op. cit., pp. 318-320.   10 Alfred North Whitehead, An Introduction to Mathematics, New York and Lon  don, 1948, p. 3.   1 * For an interesting analysis of this aspect of Swift's satire, see John M.

WALTER DE LA MARE     1 Cycloid Pudding   By JONATHAN SWIFT     [EXCERPTS: "VOYAGE TO LAPUTA" FROM  GULLIVER'S TRAVELS}   The Humours and Dispositions of the Laputians described. An Account  of their Learning. Of the King and his Court. The Author's reception  there. The Inhabitants subject to fears and disquietudes. An Account  of the Women.   AT MY alighting I was surrounded by a Crowd of People, but those who  stood nearest seemed to be of better Quality. They beheld me with all the  Marks and Circumstances of Wonder; neither indeed was I much in their  Debt; having never till then seen a Race of Mortals so singular in their  Shapes, Habits, and Countenances. Their Heads were all reclined to the  Right, or the Left; one of their Eyes turned inward, and the other directly  up to the Zenith. Their outward Garments were adorned with the Figures  of Suns, Moons, and Stars, interwoven with those of Fiddles, Flutes,  Harps, Trumpets, Guittars, Harpsicords, and many more Instruments of  Musick, unknown to us in Europe. I observed here and there many in the  Habit of Servants, with a blown Bladder fastned like a Flail to the End  of a short Stick, which they carried in their Hands. In each Bladder was  a small Quantity of dried Pease, or little Pebbles, (as I was afterwards  informed). With these Bladders they now and then flapped the Mouths  and Ears of those who stood near them, of which Practice I could not  then conceive the Meaning. It seems, the Minds of these People are so  taken up with intense Speculations, that they neither can speak, or attend  to the Discourses of others, without being rouzed by some external Taction  upon the Organs of Speech and Hearing; for which Reason, those Per  sons who are able to afford it, always keep a Flapper, (the Original is  Climenole) in their Family, as one of their Domesticks; nor even walk  abroad or make Visits without him. And the Business of this Officer is,  when two or more Persons are in Company, gently to strike with his  Bladder the Mouth of him who is to speak, and the Right Ear of him or  them to whom the Speaker addresseth himself. This Flapper is likewise   2214     Cycloid Pudding 2215   employed diligently to attend his Master in his Walks, and upon Occasion  to give him a soft Flap on his Eyes; because he is always so wrapped up  in Cogitation, that he is in manifest Danger of falling down every Preci  pice, and bouncing his Head against every Post; and in the Streets, of  jostling others, or being jostled himself into the Kennel.   It was necessary to give the Reader this Information, without which he  would be at the same Loss with me, to understand the Proceedings of  these People, as they conducted me up the Stairs, to the Top of the Island,  and from thence to the Royal Palace. While we were ascending they for  got several Times what they were about, and left me to my self, till their  Memories were again rouzed by their Flappers; for they appeared alto  gether unmoved by the Sight of my foreign Habit and Countenance, and  by the Shouts of the Vulgar, whose Thoughts and Minds were more dis  engaged.   At last we entered the Palace, and proceeded into the Chamber of  Presence; where I saw the King seated on his Throne, attended on each  Side by Persons of prime Quality. Before the Throne, was a large Table  filled with Globes and Spheres, and Mathematical Instruments of all  Kinds. His Majesty took not the least Notice of us, although our Entrance  were not without sufficient Noise, by the Concourse of all Persons belong  ing to the Court. But, he was then deep in a Problem, and we attended  at least an Hour, before he could solve it. There stood by him on each  Side, a young Page, with Flaps in their Hands; and when they saw he was  at Leisure, one of them gently struck his Mouth, and the other his Right  Ear; at which he started like one awaked on the sudden, and looking  towards me, and the Company I was in, recollected the Occasion of our  coming, whereof he had been informed before. He spoke some Words;  whereupon immediately a young Man with a Flap came up to my Side,  and flapt me gently on the Right Ear; but I made Signs as well as I  could, that I had no Occasion for such an Instrument; which as I after  wards found, gave his Majesty and the whole Court a very mean Opinion  of my Understanding. The King, as far as I could conjecture, asked me  several Questions, and I addressed my self to him in all the Languages I  had. When it was found, that I could neither understand nor be under  stood, I was conducted by his Order to an Apartment in his Palace, (this  Prince being distinguished above all his Predecessors for his Hospitality  to Strangers,) where two Servants were appointed to attend me. My  Dinner was brought, and four Persons of Quality, whom I remembered  to have seen very near the King's Person, did me the Honour to dine  with me. We had two Courses, of three Dishes each. In the first Course,  there was a Shoulder of Mutton, cut into an Equilateral Triangle; a Piece  of Beef into a Rhomboides; and a Pudding into a Cycloid. The second  Course was two Ducks, trussed up into the Form of Fiddles; Sausages and     Jonathan Swift  2216   Puddings resembling Flutes and Haut-boys, and a Breast of Veal in the  Shape of a Harp. The Servants cut our Bread into Cones, Cylinders,  Parallelograms, and several other Mathematical Figures. While we were  at Dinner, I made bold to ask the Names of several Things in their Lan  guage; and those noble Persons, by the Assistance of their Flappers, de  lighted to give me Answers, hoping to raise my Admiration of their great  Abilities, if I could be brought to converse with them. I was soon able to  call for Bread, and Drink, or whatever else I wanted.   After Dinner my Company withdrew, and a Person was sent to me by  the King's Order, attended by a Flapper. He brought with him Pen, Ink,  and Paper, and three or four Books; giving me to understand by Signs,  that he was sent to teach me the Language. We sat together four Hours,  in which Time I wrote down a great Number of Words in Columns, with  the Translations over against them. I likewise made a Shift to learn several  short Sentences. For my Tutor would order one of my Servants to fetch  something, to turn about, to make a Bow, to sit, or stand, or walk, and  the like. Then I took down the Sentence in Writing. He shewed me also  in one of his Books, the Figures of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Zodiack,  the Tropics and Polar Circles, together with the Denominations of many  Figures of Planes and Solids. He gave me the Names and Descriptions of  all the Musical Instruments, and the general Terms of Art in playing on  each of them. After he had left me, I placed all my Words with their  Interpretations in alphabetical Order. And thus in a few Days, by the  Help of a very faithful Memory, I got some Insight into their Language.   The Word, which I interpret the Flying or Floating Island, is in the  Original Laputa; whereof I could never learn the true Etymology. Lap in  the old obsolete Language signifieth High, and Untuh a Governor, from  which they say by Corruption was derived Laputa from Lapuntuh. But I  do not approve of this Derivation, which seems to be a little strained. I  ventured to offer to the Learned among them a Conjecture of my own,  that Laputa was quasi Lap outed', Lap signifying properly the dancing of  the Sun Beams in the Sea; and outed a Wing, which however I shall not  obtrude, but submit to the judicious Reader.   Those to whom the King had entrusted me, observing how ill I was  clad, ordered a Taylor to come next Morning, and take my Measure for  a Suit of Cloths, This Operator did his Office after a different Manner  from those of his Trade in Europe. He first took my Altitude by a  Quadrant, and then with Rule and Compasses, described the Dimensions  and Out-Lines of my whole Body; all which he entred upon Paper, and  in six Days brought my Cloths very ill made, and quite out of Shape, by  happening to mistake a Figure in the Calculation. But my Comfort was,  that I observed such Accidents very frequent, and little regarded.   During my Confinement for want of Cloaths, and by an Indisposition     Cycloid Pudding 2217   that held me some Days longer, I much enlarged my Dictionary; and  when I went next to Court, was able to understand many Things the King  spoke, and to return him some Kind of Answers. His Majesty had given  Orders, that the Island should move North-East and by East, to the verti  cal Point over Lagado, the Metropolis of the whole Kingdom, below  upon the firm Earth. It was about Ninety Leagues distant, and our Voyage  lasted four Days and an Half. I was not in the least sensible of the pro  gressive Motion made in the Air by the Island. On the second Morning,  about Eleven o'Clock, the King himself in Person, attended by his Nobil  ity, Courtiers, and Officers, having prepared all their Musical Instruments,  played on them for three Hours without Intermission; so that I was quite  stunned with the Noise; neither could I possibly guess the Meaning, till  my Tutor informed me. He said, that the People of their Island had their  Ears adapted to hear the Musick of the Spheres, which always played at  certain Periods; and the Court was now prepared to bear their Part in  whatever Instrument they most excelled.   In our Journey towards Lagado the Capital City, his Majesty ordered  that the Island should stop over certain Towns and Villages, from whence  he might receive the Petitions of his Subjects. And to this Purpose, several  Packthreads were let down with small Weights at the Bottom. On these  Packthreads the People strung their Petitions, which mounted up directly  like the Scraps of Paper fastned by School-boys at the End of the String  that holds their Kite. Sometimes we received Wine and Victuals from  below, which were drawn up by Pullies.   The Knowledge I had in Mathematicks gave me great Assistance in  acquiring their Phraseology, which depended much upon that Science  and Musick; and in the latter I was not unskilled. Their Ideas are perpet  ually conversant in Lines and Figures. If they would, for Example, praise  the Beauty of a Woman, or any other Animal, they describe it by Rhombs,  Circles, Parallelograms, Ellipses, and other Geometrical Terms; or else  by Words of Art drawn from Musick, needless here to repeat. I observed  in the King's Kitchen all Sorts of Mathematical and Musical Instruments,  after the Figures of which they cut up the Joynts that were served to his  Majesty's Table.   Their Houses are very ill built, the Walls bevil, without one right Angle  in any Apartment; and this Defect ariseth from the Contempt they bear  for practical Geometry; which they despise as vulgar and mechanick,  those Instructions they give being too refined for the Intellectuals of their  Workmen; which occasions perpetual Mistakes. And although they are  dextrous enough upon a Piece of Paper, in the Management of the Rule,  the Pencil, and the Divider, yet in the common Actions and Behaviour  of Life, I have not seen a more clumsy, awkward, and unhandy People,  nor so slow and perplexed in their Conceptions upon all other Subjects,     22 jg Jonathan Swift   except those of Mathematicks and Musick. They are very bad Reasoners,  and vehemently given to Opposition, unless when they happen to be of the  right Opinion, which is seldom their Case. Imagination, Fancy, and  Invention, they are wholly Strangers to, nor have any Words in their  Language by which those Ideas can be expressed; the whole Compass of  their thoughts and Mind, being shut up within the two forementioned  Sciences.   Most of them, and especially those who deal in the Astronomical Part,  have great Faith in judicial Astrology, although they are ashamed to own  it publickly. But, what I chiefly admired, and thought altogether un  accountable, was the strong Disposition I observed in them towards News  and Politicks; perpetually enquiring into publick Affairs, giving their  Judgments in Matters of State; and passionately disputing every Inch of a  Party Opinion. I have indeed observed the same Disposition among most  of the Mathematicians I have known in Europe; although I could never  discover the least Analogy between the two Sciences; unless those People  suppose, that because the smallest Circle hath as many Degrees as the  largest, therefore the Regulation and Management of the World require  no more Abilities than the handling and turning of a Globe. But, I rather  take this Quality to spring from a very common Infirmity of human Na  ture, inclining us to be more curious and conceited in Matters where we  have least Concern, and for which we are least adapted either by Study  or Nature.   These People are under continual Disquietudes, never enjoying a Min  ute's Peace of Mind; and their Disturbances proceed from Causes which  very little affect the rest of Mortals. Their Apprehensions arise from  several Changes they dread in the Celestial Bodies. For Instance; that the  Earth by the continual Approaches of the Sun towards it, must in Course  of Time be absorbed or swallowed up. That the Face of the Sun will by  Degrees be encrusted with its own Effluvia, and give no more Light to the  World. That, the Earth very narrowly escaped a Brush from the Tail of  the last Comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to Ashes; and that  the next, which they have calculated for One and Thirty Years hence, will  probably destroy us. For, if in its Perihelion it should approach within a  certain Degree of the Sun, (as by their Calculations they have Reason to  dread) it will conceive a Degree of Heat ten Thousand Times more  intense than that of red hot glowing Iron; and in its Absence from the  Sun, carry a blazing Tail Ten Hundred Thousand and Fourteen Miles  long; through which if the Earth should pass at the Distance of one  Hundred Thousand Miles from the Nucleus, or main Body of the Comet,  it must in its Passage be set on Fire, and reduced to Ashes. That the Sun  daily spending its Rays without any Nutriment to supply them, will at last  be wholly consumed and annihilated; which must be attended with the     Cycloid Pudding 2219   Destruction of this Earth, and of all the Planets that receive their Light  from it.   They are so perpetually alarmed with the Apprehenisons of these and  the like impending Dangers, that they can neither sleep quietly in their  Beds, nor have any Relish for the common Pleasures or Amusements of  Life. When they meet an Acquaintance in the Morning, the first Question  is about the Sun's Health; how he looked at his Setting and Rising, and  what Hopes they have to avoid the Stroak of the approaching Comet.  This Conversation they are apt to run into with the same Temper that  Boys discover, in delighting to hear terrible Stories of Sprites and Hob  goblins, which they greedily listen to, and dare not go to Bed for fear.   The Women of the Island have Abundance of Vivacity; they contemn  their Husbands, and are exceedingly fond of Strangers, whereof there is  always a considerable Number from the Continent below, attending at  Court, either upon Affairs of the several Towns and Corporations, or their  own particular Occasions; but are much despised, because they want the  same Endowments. Among these the Ladies chuse their Gallants: But  the Vexation is, that they act with too much Ease and Security; for the  Husband is always so wrapped in Speculation, that the Mistress and Lover  may proceed to the greatest Familiarities before his Face, if he be but  provided with Paper and Implements, and without his Flapper at his Side.   The Wives and Daughters lament their Confinement to the Island, al  though I think it the most delicious Spot of Ground in the World; and  although they live here in the greatest Plenty and Magnificence, and are  allowed to do whatever they please: They long to see the World, and take  the Diversions of the Metropolis, which they are not allowed to do without  a particular Licence from the King; and this is not easy to be obtained,  because the People of Quality have found by frequent Experience, how  hard it is to persuade their Women to return from below. I was told,  that a great Court Lady, who had several Children, is married to the  prime Minister, the richest Subject in the Kingdom, a very graceful Per  son, extremely fond of her, and lives in the finest Palace of the Island;  went down to Lagado> on the Pretence of Health, there hid her self for  several Months, till the King sent a Warrant to search for her; and she was  found in an obscure Eating-House all in Rags, having pawned her Cloths  to maintain an old deformed Footman, who beat her every Day, and in  whose Company she was taken much against her Will. And although her  Husband received her with all possible Kindness, and without the least  Reproach; she soon after contrived to steal down again with all her Jewels,  to the same Gallant, and hath not been heard of since.   This may perhaps pass with the Reader rather for an European or  English Story, than for one of a Country so remote. But he may please  to consider, that the Caprices of Womankind are not limited by any     T'ffii Jonathan Swift   Climate or Nation; and that they are much more uniform than can be  easily imagined.   In about a Month's Time I had made a tolerable Proficiency in their  Language, and was able to answer most of the King's Questions, when I  had the Honour to attend him. His Majesty discovered not the least Curi  osity to enquire into the Laws, Government, History, Religion, or Man  ners of the Countries where I had been; but confined his Questions to the  State of Mathematicks, and received the Account I gave him, with great  Contempt and Indifference, though often rouzed by his Flapper on each  Side.   ... I was at the Mathematical School, where the Master taught his  Pupils after a Method scarce imaginable to us in Europe. The Proposition  and Demonstration were fairly written on a thin Wafer, with Ink com  posed of a Cephalick Tincture. This the Student was to swallow upon a  fasting Stomach, and for three Days following eat nothing but Bread and  Water. As the Wafer digested, the Tincture mounted to his Brain, bearing  the Proposition along with it. But the Success hath not hitherto been  answerable, partly by some Error in the Quantum or Composition, and  partly by the Perverseness of Lads; to whom this Bolus is so nauseous,  that they generally steal aside, and discharge it upwards before it can  operate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an Absti  nence as the Prescription requires.     COMMENTARY ON   ALDOUS HUXLEY     AJDOUS HUXLEY is the son of Leonard Huxley, the grandson of  Thomas Henry Huxley and Thomas Arnold, the nephew of Mrs.  Humphrey Ward and the grandnephew of Matthew Arnold. He is himself  a novelist and an essayist of high gifts; his writings are marked by imag  ination, insight and feeling, unfailing intelligence and a superb command  of language. The rational, skeptical and scientific strain of T, H. Huxley  is in his work; also defeatism, a lack of faith in humanity, anger and  disgust. His grandfather had urged upon Charles Kingsley "the merits of  life on 'this narrow ledge of uncertainty.' " Like others of his generation,  the grandson came to regard these merits as insufficient to offset the  discomfort and the anxiety of living on a ledge. He has moved, therefore,  to the higher and broader shelf of mysticism, a strange sanctuary for one  to whom a rigorous nineteenth-century naturalism is still so persuasive.  The side-by-sideness of a rational and a mystical outlook is one of the  most striking features of his work.   Huxley was born in Surrey in 1894, and was educated at a preparatory  school and at Eton. Science, he says, was a "gospel and exhortation" in  his family and he planned to become a doctor. Unfortunately he con  tracted keratitis and became within a few months almost completely blind.  "I learned to read books and music in Braille and to use a typewriter, and  continued my education with tutors. At this period, when I was about  eighteen, I wrote a complete novel which I was never able to read, as it  was written by touch on the typewriter without the help of eyes. By the  time I could read again, the manuscript was lost." l After two years he  had recovered sufficiently to read with one eye, aided by a magnifying  glass. Though the limitations of his vision made a scientific career impos  sible, Huxley was able to attend courses at Oxford, and take his degree in  English literature and philology.   In 1916 appeared Huxley's first book, The Burning Wheel, a collection  of symbolist poetry. After the war he joined the staff of the Athenaeum,  under the editorship of John Middleton Muny, and for several years "did  a great variety of literary journalism for many periodicals." During the  1920s he and his wife spent much time in Italy, and in close association  with D. H. Lawrence. He has lived also in France, in Central America  and, since 1938, in Southern California. The early novels of "skeptical   1 Stanley J. Kunitz and Howard Haycraft, Twentieth Century Authors, article on  Huxley, New York, 1942. I have followed Huxley's own account of his life as given in  this biographical dictionary.   2221     MM Editor's Comment   brilliance" were Crome Yellow (1921), Antic Hay (1923) and Point  Counter Point (1926). They are still regarded by many critics as the best  of Huxley's work. Among the better known of his later writings are the  novels Brave New World (1932), Eyeless in Gaza (1936), After Many a  Summer Dies the Swan (1940), The Devils of Loudon (1952) ; his essays  Jesting Pilate (1926), Brief Candles (1930), Ends and Means (1937);  and his biography of Father Joseph, a seventeenth-century French mystic,  entitled Grey Eminence. He has worked as a screen writer.   J. W. N, Sullivan, who interviewed Huxley in the thirties, records some  clarifying glimpses into his mind. "My chief motive in writing has been  the desire to express a point of view. Or, rather, the desire to clarify a  point of view to myself. I do not write for my readers; in fact, I don't like  thinking about my readers." Sullivan asked whether he thought mankind  had progressed. Huxley replied: "Yes, since Neanderthal times. But it is  very difficult to say that mankind is now progressing. The question is,  what do we want to aim at. Progress in one direction hinders progress in  some other direction. For instance, our great mechanical progress has  hindered intellectual progress. And it seems clear to me that intellectual  development often hinders emotional development. If we evolved a race  of Isaac Newtons, that would not be progress. For the price Newton had  to pay for being a supreme intellect was that he was incapable of friend  ship, love, fatherhood, and many other desirable things. As a man he was  a failure; as a monster he was superb. I admit that mathematical science  is a good thing. But excessive devotion to it is a bad thing. Excessive, or  rather exclusive, devotion to anything is bad." 2 This statement is an  admirable epitome of his outlook on life.   "Young Archimedes" is the title story of a collection published in 1924.  It is a moving, graceful example of Huxley's artistry. I am happy to in  clude it in this work, though I expect the author to be surprised at finding  one of his short stories in an anthology of mathematics.   2 J. W. N.

WILLIAM BLAKE     Young Archimedes   By ALDOUS HUXLEY     IT was the view which finally made us take the place. True, the house  had its disadvantages. It was a long way out of town and had no tele  phone. The rent was unduly high, the drainage system poor. On windy  nights, when the ill-fitting panes were rattling so furiously in the window  frames that you could fancy yourself in an hotel omnibus, the electric  light, for some mysterious reason, used invariably to go out and leave  you in the noisy dark. There was a splendid bathroom; but the electric  pump, which was supposed to send up water from the rainwater tanks  in the terrace, did not work. Punctually every autumn the drinking well  ran dry. And our landlady was a liar and a cheat.   But these are the little disadvantages of every hired house, all over the  world. For Italy they were not really at all serious. I have seen plenty of  houses which had them all and a hundred others, without possessing the  compensating advantages of ours the southward-facing garden and ter  race for the winter and spring, the large cool rooms against the mid  summer heat, the hilltop air and freedom from mosquitoes, and finally  the view.   And what a view it was! Or rather, what a succession of views. For it  was different every day; aud without stirring from the house one had the  impression of an incessant change of scene: all the delights of travel with  out its fatigues. There were autumn days when all the valleys were filled  with mist and the crest of the Apennines rose darkly out of a flat white  lake. There were days when the mist invaded even our hilltop and we were  enveloped in a soft vapor in which the mist-colored olive trees, that sloped  away below our windows towards the valley, disappeared as though into  their own spiritual essence; and the only firm and definite things in the  small, dim world within which we found ourselves confined were the two  tall black cypresses growing on a little projecting terrace a hundred feet  down the hill. Black, sharp, and solid, they stood there, twin pillars of  Hercules at the extremity of the known universe; and beyond them there  was only pale cloud and round them only the cloudy olive trees.   These were the wintry days; but there were days of spring and autumn,  days unchallengingly cloudless, or more lovely still made various by   2223     . Aldous Huxley   the huge floating shapes of vapor that, snowy above the faraway, snow  capped mountains, gradually unfolded, against the pale bright blue, enor  mous heroic gestures. And in the height of the sky the bellying draperies,  the swans, the aerial marbles, hewed and left unfinished by gods grown  tired of creation almost before they had begun, drifted sleeping along the  wind, changing form as they moved. And the sun would come and go  behind them; and now the town in the valley would fade and almost  vanish in the shadow, and now, like an immense fretted jewel between  the hills, it would glow as though by its own light. And looking across the  nearer tributary valley that wound from below our crest down towards  the Arno, looking over the low dark shoulder of hill on whose extreme  promonotory stood the towered church of San Miniato, one saw the  huge dome airily hanging on its ribs of masonry, the square campanile,  the sharp spire of Santa Croce, and the canopied tower of the Signoria,  rising above the intricate maze of houses, distinct and brilliant, like small  treasures carved out of precious stones. For a moment only, and then their  light would fade away once more, and the traveling beam would pick out,  among the indigo hill beyond, a single golden crest.   There were days when the air was wet with passed or with approaching  rain, and all the distances seemed miraculously near and clear. The olive  trees detached themselves one from another on the distant slopes; the  faraway villages were lovely and pathetic like the most exquisite small  toys. There were days in summertime, days of impending thunder when,  bright and sunlit against huge bellying masses of black and purple, the  hills and the white houses shone as it were precariously, in a dying  splendor, on the brink of some fearful calamity.   How the hills changed and varied! Every day and every hour of the  day, almost, they were different. There would be moments when, looking  across the plans of Florence, one would see only a dark blue silhouette  against the sky. The scene had no depth; there was only a hanging curtain  painted flatly with the symbols of the mountains. And then, suddenly  almost, with the passing of a cloud, or when the sun had declined to a  certain level in the sky, the flat scene transformed itself; and where there  had been only a painted curtain, now there were ranges behind ranges of  hills, graduated tone after tone from brown, or gray, or a green gold to  faraway blue. Shapes that a moment before had been fused together indis  criminately into a single mass now came apart into their constituents.  Fiesole, which had seemed only a spur of Monte Morello, now revealed  itself as the jutting headland of another system of hills, divided from the  nearest bastions of its greater neighbor by a deep and shadowy valley.   At noon, during the heats of summer, the landscape became dim,  powdery, vague and almost colorless under the midday sun; the hills dis  appeared into the trembling fringes of the sky. But as the afternoon wore     Young Archimedes 2225   on the landscape emerged again, it dropped its anonymity, it climbed  back out of nothingness into form and life. And its life, as the sun sank  and slowly sank through the long afternoon, grew richer, grew more  intense with every moment. The level light, with its attendant long, dark  shadows, laid bare, so to speak, the anatomy of the land; the hills each  western escarpment shining, and each slope averted from the sunlight  profoundly shadowed became massive, jutty, and solid. Little folds of  dimples in the seemingly even ground revealed themselves. Eastward from  our hilltop, across the plain of the Ema, a great bluff casts its ever-increas  ing shadow; in the surrounding brightness of the valley a whole town lay  eclipsed within it. And as the sun expired on the horizon, the further hills  flushed in its warm light, till their illumined flanks were the color of  tawny roses; but the valleys were already filled with the blue mist of the  evening. And it mounted, mounted; the fire went out of the western win  dows of the populous slopes; only the crests were still alight, and at last  they too were all extinct. The mountains faded and fused together again  into a flat painting of mountains against the pale evening sky. In a little  while it was night; and if the moon were full, a ghost of the dead scene  still haunted the horizons.   Changed in its beauty, this wide landscape always preserved a quality  of humanness and domestication which made it, to my mind at any rate,  the best of all landscapes to live with. Day by day one traveled through  its different beauties; but the journey, like our ancestors' Grand Tour, was  always a journey through civilization. For all its mountains, its deep slopes  and deep valleys, the Tuscan scene is dominated by its inhabitants. They  have cultivated every rood of ground that can be cultivated; their houses  are thickly scattered even over the hills, and the valleys are populous.  Solitary on the hilltop, one is not alone in a wilderness. Man's traces are  across the country, and already one feels it with satisfaction as one looks  out across it for centuries, for thousands of years; it has been his, sub  missive, tamed, and humanized. The wide, blank moorlands, the sands,  the forests of innumerable trees these are places for occasional visitation,  healthful to the spirit which submits itself to them for not too long. But  fiendish influences as well as divine haunt these total solitudes. The vege  tative life of plants and things is alien and hostile to the human. Men  cannot live at ease except where they have mastered their surroundings  and where their accumulated lives outnumber and outweigh the vegetative  lives about them. Stripped of its dark wood, planted, terraced and tilled  almost to the mountains' tops, the Tuscan landscape is humanized and  safe. Sometimes upon those who live in the midst of it there comes a long  ing for some place that is solitary, inhuman, lifeless, or peopled only  with alien life. But the longing is soon satisfied, and one is glad to return  to the civilized and submissive scene.     2226 Aldous Huxley   I found that house on the hilltop the ideal dwelling place. For there,  safe in the midst of a humanized landscape, one was yet alone; one could  be as solitary as one liked. Neighbors whom one never sees at close  quarters are the ideal and perfect neighbors.   Our nearest neighbors, in terms of physical proximity, lived very near.  We had two sets of them, as a matter of fact, almost in the same house  with us. One was the peasant family, who lived in a long, low building,  part dwelling house, part stables, storerooms and cow sheds, adjoining the  villa. Our other neighborsintermittent neighbors, however, for they only  ventured out of town every now and then, during the most flawless  weather were the owners of the villa, who had reserved for themselves  the smaller wing of the huge L-shaped house a mere dozen rooms or so  leaving the remaining eighteen or twenty to us.   They were a curious couple, our proprietors. An old husband, gray,  listless, tottering, seventy at least; and a signora of about forty, short, very  plump, with tiny fat hands and feet and a pair of very large, very dark  black eyes, which she used with all the skill of a born comedian. Her  vitality, if you could have harnessed it and made it do some useful work,  would have supplied a whole town with electric light. The physicists talk  of deriving energy from the atom; they would be more profitably em  ployed nearer home in discovering some way of tapping those enormous  stores of vital energy which accumulate in unemployed women of sanguine  temperament and which, in the present imperfect state of social and  scientific organization, vent themselves in ways that are generally so de  plorable in interfering with other people's affairs, in working up emotional  scenes, in thinking about love and making it, and in bothering men till  they cannot get on with their work.   Signora Bondi got rid of her superfluous energy, among other ways,   by "doing in" her tenants. The old gentleman, who was a retired merchant   with a reputation for the most perfect rectitude, was allowed to have no   dealings with us. When we came to see the house, it was the wife who   showed us round. It was she who, with a lavish display of charm, with   irresistible rollings of the eyes, expatiated on the merits of the place, sang   the praises of the electric pump, glorified the bathroom (considering   which, she insisted, the rent was remarkably moderate), and when we   suggested calling in a surveyor to look over the house, earnestly begged us,   as though our well-being were her only consideration, not to waste our   money unnecessarily in doing anything so superfluous. "After all," she   said, "we are honest people. I wouldn't dream of letting you the house   except in perfect condition. Have confidence." And she looked at me with   an appealing, pained expression in her magnificent eyes, as though begging   me not to insult her by my coarse suspiciousness. And leaving us no time   to pursue the subject of surveyors any further, she began assuring us that     Young Archimedes 2227   our little boy was the most beautiful angel she had ever seen. By the time  our interview with Signora Bondi was at an end, we had definitely decided  to take the house.   "Charming woman," I said, as we left the house. But I think that Eliz  abeth was not quite so certain of it as I.   Then the pump episode began.   On the evening of our arrival in the house we switched on the elec  tricity. The pump made a very professional whirring noise; but no water  came out of the taps in the bathroom. We looked at one another doubt  fully.   "Charming woman?" Elizabeth raised her eyebrows.   We asked for interviews; but somehow the old gentleman could never  see us, and the Signora was invariably out or indisposed. We left notes;  they were never answered. In the end, we found that the only method of  communicating with our landlords, who were living in the same house  with us, was to go down into Florence and send a registered express letter  to them. For this they had to sign two separate receipts and even, if we  chose to pay forty centimes more, a third incriminating document, which  was then returned to us. There could be no pretending, as there always  was with ordinary letters or notes, that the communication had never been  received. We began at last to get answers to our complaints. The Signora,  who wrote all the letters, started by telling us that, naturally, the pump  didn't work, as the cisterns were empty, owing to the long drought. I had  to walk three miles to the post office in order to register my letter remind  ing her that there had been a violent thunderstorm only last Wednesday,  and that the tanks were consequently more than half full. The answer  came back: bath water had not been guaranteed in the contract; and if  I wanted it, why hadn't I had the pump looked at before I took the house?  Another walk into town to ask the Signora next door whether she remem  bered her adjurations to us to have confidence in her, and to inform her,  that the existence in a house of a bathroom was in itself an implicit guar  antee of bath water. The reply to that was that the Signora couldn't con  tinue to have communications with people who wrote so rudely to her.  After that I put the matter into the hands of a lawyer. Two months later  the pump was actually replaced. But we had to serve a writ on the lady  before she gave in. And the costs were considerable.   One day, towards the end of the episode, I met the old gentleman in  the road, taking his big Maremman dog for a walk or being taken,  rather, for a walk by the dog. For where the dog pulled the old gentleman  had perforce to follow. And when it stopped to smell, or scratch the  ground, or leave against a gatepost its visiting card or an offensive chal  lenge, patiently, at his end of the leash, the old man had to wait. I passed  him standing at the side of the road, a few hundred yards below our     Aldous Huxley   2228   house. The dog was sniffing at the roots of one of the twin cypresses  which grew one on either side of the entry to a farm; I heard the beast  growling indignantly to itself, as though it scented an intolerable insult.  Old Signor Bondi, leashed to his dog, was waiting. The knees inside the  tubular gray trousers were slightly bent. Leaning on his cane, he stood  gazing mournfully and vacantly at the view. The whites of his old eyes  were discolored, like ancient billiard balls. In the gray, deeply wrinkled  face, his nose was dyspeptically red. His white mustache, ragged and  yellowing at the fringes, drooped in a melancholy curve. In his black tie  he wore a very large diamond; perhaps that was what Signora Bondi had  found so attractive about him.   I took off my hat as I approached. The old man stared at me absently,  and it was only when I was already almost past him that he recollected   who I was.   "Wait," he called after me, "wait!" And he hastened down the road in  pursuit. Taken utterly by surprise and at a disadvantage for it was  engaged in retorting to the affront imprinted on the cypress roots the  dog permitted itself to be jerked after him. Too much astonished to be  anything but obedient, it followed its master. "Wait!"   I waited.   "My dear sir," said the old gentleman, catching me by the lapel of my  coat and blowing most disagreeably in my face, "I want to apologize."  He looked around him, as though afraid that even here he might be over  heard. "I want to apologize," he went on, "about the wretched pump busi  ness. I assure you that, if it had been only my affair, I'd have put the  thing right as soon as you asked. You were quite right: a bathroom is an  implicit guarantee of bath water. I saw from the first that we should  have no chance if it came to court. And besides, I think one ought to treat  one's tenants as handsomely as one can afford to. But my wife" he  lowered his voice "the fact is that she likes this sort of thing, even when  she knows that she's in the wrong and must lose. And besides, she hoped,  I dare say, that you'd get tired of asking and have the job done yourself.  I told her from the first that we ought to give in; but she wouldn't listen.  You see, she enjoys it. Still, now she sees that it must be done. In the  course of the next two or three days you'll be having your bath water.  But I thought Fd just like to tell you how . . ." But the Maremmano,  which had recovered by this time from its surprise of a moment since,  suddenly bounded, growling, up the road. The old gentleman tried to  hold the beast, strained at the leash, tottered unsteadily, then gave way  and allowed himself to be dragged off. ". . . how sorry I am," he went  on, as he receded from me, "that this little misunderstanding . . ." But  it was no use. "Good-by." He smiled politely, made a little deprecating  gesture, as though he had suddenly remembered a pressing engagement,     Young Archimedes 2229   and had no time to explain what it was. "Good-by." He took off his hat  and abandoned himself completely to the dog.   A week later the water really did begin to flow, and the day after our  first bath Signora Bondi, dressed in dove-gray satin and wearing all her  pearls, came to call.   "Is it peace now?" she asked, with a charming frankness, as she shook  hands.   We assured her that, so far as we were concerned, it certainly was.   "But why did you write me such dreadfully rude letters?" she said,  turning on me a reproachful glance that ought to have moved the most  ruthless malefactor to contrition. "And then that writ. How could you?  To a lady . . ."   I mumbled something about the pump and our wanting baths.   "But how could you expect me to listen to you while you were in that  mood? Why didn't you set about it differently politely, charmingly?"  She smiled at me and dropped her fluttering eyelids.   I thought it best to change the conversation. It is disagreeable, when one  is in the right, to be made to appear in the wrong.   A few weeks later we had a letter duly registered and by express  messenger in which the Signora asked us whether we proposed to renew  our lease (which was 'only for six months), and notifying us that, if we  did, the rent would be raised twenty-five per cent, in consideration of the  improvements which had been carried out. We thought ourselves lucky,  at the end of much bargaining, to get the lease renewed for a whole year  with an increase in the rent of only fifteen per cent.   It was chiefly for the sake of the view that we put up with these intoler  able extortions. But we had found other reasons, after a few days' resi  dence, for liking the house. Of these the most cogent was that, in the  peasant's youngest child, we had discovered what seemed the perfect play  fellow for our own small boy. Between little Guido for that was his  name and the youngest of his brothers and sisters there was a gap of six  or seven years. His two older brothers worked with their father in the  fields; since the time of the mother's death, two or three years before we  knew them, the eldest sister had ruled the house, and the younger, who  had just left school, helped her and in between-whiles kept an eye on  Guido, who by this time, however, needed very little looking after; for he  was between six and seven years old and as precocious, self-assured, and  responsible as the children of the poor, left as they are to themselves  almost from the time they can walk, generally are.   Though fully two and a half years older than little Robin and at that  age thirty months are crammed with half a lifetime's experience Guido  took no undue advantage of his superior intelligence and strength. I have  never seen a child more patient, tolerant, and ^tyrannical. He never     Aldous Huxley  2230   laughed at Robin for his clumsy efforts to imitate his own prodigious  feats- he did not tease or bully, but helped his small companion when he  was in difficulties and explained when he could not understand. In return,  Robin adored him, regarded him as the model and perfect Big Boy, and  slavishly imitated him in every way he could.   These attempts of Robin's to imitate his companion were often exceed  ingly ludicrous. For by an obscure psychological law, words and actions in  themselves quite serious become comic as soon as they are copied; and  the more accurately, if the imitation is a deliberate parody, the funnier  for an overloaded imitation of someone we know does not make us laugh  so much as one that is almost indistinguishably like the original. The bad  imitation is only ludicrous when it is a piece of sincere and earnest flattery  which does not quite come off. Robin's imitations were mostly of this  kind. His heroic and unsuccessful attempts to perform the feats of  strength and skill, which Guido could do with ease, were exquisitely  comic. And his careful, long-drawn imitations of Guido's habits and  mannerisms were no less amusing. Most ludicrous of all, because most  earnestly undertaken and most incongruous in the imitator, were Robin's  impersonations of Guido in a pensive mood. Guido was a thoughtful  child given to brooding and sudden abstractions. One would find him  sitting in a corner by himself, chin in hand, elbow on knee, plunged, to  all appearances, in the profoundest meditation. And sometimes, even in  the midst of his play, he would suddenly break off, to stand, his hands  behind his back, frowning and staring at the ground. When this happened,  Robin became overawed and a little disquieted. In a puzzled silence he  looked at his companion. "Guido," he would say softly, "Guido." But  Guido was generally too much preoccupied to answer; and Robin, not  venturing to insist, would creep near him, and throwing himself as nearly  as possible into Guido's attitude standing Napoleonically, his hands  clasped behind him, or sitting in the posture of Michelangelo's Lorenzo  the Magnificent would try to meditate too. Every few seconds he would  turn his bright blue eyes towards the elder child to see whether he was  doing it quite right. But at the end of a minute he began to grow impa  tient; meditation wasn't his strong point. "Guido," he called again and,  louder, "Guido!" And he would take him by the hand and try to pull him  away. Sometimes Guido roused himself from his reverie and went back  to the interrupted game. Sometimes he paid no attention. Melancholy,  perplexed, Robin had to take himself off to play by himself. And Guido  would go on sitting or standing there, quite still; and his eyes, if one  looked into them, were beautiful in their grave and pensive calm.   They were large eyes, set far apart and, what was strange in a dark-  haired Italian child, of a luminous pale blue-gray color. They were not  always grave and calig^as in these pensive moments. When he was play-     Young Archimedes 2231   ing, when he talked or laughed, they lit up; and the surface of those clear,  pale lakes of thought seemed, as it were, to be shaken into brilliant  sun-flashing ripples. Above those eyes was a beautiful forehead, high and  steep and domed in a curve that was like a subtle curve of a rose petal.  The nose was straight, the chin small and rather pointed, the mouth  drooped a little sadly at the corners.   I have a snapshot of the two children sitting together on the parapet  of the terrace. Guido sits almost facing the camera, but looking a little  to one side and downwards; his hands are crossed in his lap and his ex  pression, his attitude are thoughtful, grave, and meditative. It is Guido  in one of those moods of abstraction into which he would pass even 'at  the height of laughter and play quite suddenly and completely, as though  he had all at once taken it into his head to go away and left the silent  and beautiful body behind, like an empty house, to wait for his return.  And by its side sits little Robin, turning to look up at him, his face half  averted from the camera, but the curve of his cheek showing that he is  laughing; one little raised hand is caught at the top of a gesture, the other  clutches at Guide's sleeves, as though he were urging him to come away  and play. And the legs dangling from the parapet have been seen by the  blinking instrument in the midst of an impatient wriggle; he is on the  point of slipping down and running off to play hide-and-seek in the  garden. All the essential characteristics of both the children are in that  little snapshot.   "If Robin were not Robin," Elizabeth used to say, "I could almost  wish he were Guido."   And even at that time, when I took no particular interest in the child,  I agreed with her. Guido seemed to me one of the most charming little  boys I had ever seen.   We were not alone in admiring him. Signora Bondi when, in those  cordial intervals between our quarrels, she came to call, was constantly  speaking of him. "Such a beautiful, beautiful child!" she would exclaim  with enthusiasm. "It's really a waste that he should belong to peasants  who can't afford to dress him properly. If he were mine, I should put him  into black velvet; or little white knickers and a white knitted silk jersey  with a red line at the collar and cuffs; or perhaps a white sailor suit would  be pretty. And in winter a little fur coat, with a squirrelskin cap, and  possibly Russian boots . . ." Her imagination was running away with  her. "And I'd let his hair grow, like a page's, and have it just curled up  a little at the tips. And a straight fringe across his forehead. Everyone  would turn round and stare after us if I took him out with me in Via  TornabuonL"   What you want, I should have liked to tell her, is not a child; if s a  clockwork doll or a performing monkey. But I did not say so partly     Aldous Huxley  2232   because I could not think of the Italian for a clockwork doll and partly  because I did not want to risk having the rent raised another fifteen per   ^Ab if I only had a little boy like that!" She sighed and modestly  dropped her eyelids. "I adore children, ^sometimes think of adopting  one that is, if my husband would allow it."   I thought of the poor old gentleman being dragged along at the heels  of his big white dog and inwardly smiled.   "But I don't know if he would," the signora was continuing, "I don't  know if he would." She was silent for a moment, as though considering   a new idea.   A few days later, when we were sitting in the garden after luncheon,  drinking our coffee, Guido's father instead of passing with a nod and the  usual cheerful good day, halted in front of us and began to talk. He was  a fine handsome man, not very tall, but well proportioned, quick and  elastic in his movements, and full of life. He had a thin brown face,  featured like a Roman's and lit by a pair of the most intelligent-looking  gray eyes I ever saw. They exhibited almost too much intelligence when,  as not infrequently happened, he was trying, with an assumption of per  fect frankness and a childlike innocence, to take one in or get something  out of one. Delighting in itself, the intelligence shone there mischievously.  The face might be ingenuous, impassive, almost imbecile in its expression;  but the eyes on these occasions gave him completely away. One knew,  when they glittered like that, that one would have to be careful.   Today, however, there was no dangerous light in them. He wanted  nothing out of us, nothing of any value only advice, which is a com  modity, he knew, that most people are only too happy to part with. But  he wanted advice on what was, for us, rather a delicate subject: on  Signora Bondi. Carlo had often complained to us about her. The old man  is good, he told us, very good and kind indeed. Which meant, I dare say,  among other things, that he could easily be swindled. But his wife. . . .  Well, the woman was a beast* And he would tell us stories of her insatiable  rapacity: she was always claiming more than the half of the produce  which, by the laws of the metayage systems, was the proprietor's due. He  complained of her suspiciousness: she was forever accusing him of sharp  practices, of downright stealing him, he struck his breast, the soul of  honesty. He complained of her shortsighted avarice: she wouldn't spend  enough on manure, wouldn't buy him another cow, wouldn't have electric  light installed in the stables. And we had sympathized, but cautiously,  without expressing too strong an opinion on the subject. The Italians are  wonderfully noncommittal in their speech; they will give nothing away  to an interested person until they are quite certain that it is right and  necessary and, above all, safe to do so. We had lived long enough among     Young Archimedes 2233   them to imitate their caution. What we said to Carlo would be sure,  sooner or later, to get back to Signora Bondi. There was nothing to be  gained by unnecessarily embittering our relations with the lady only  another fifteen per cent, very likely, to be lost.   Today he wasn't so much complaining as feeling perplexed. The  Signora had sent for him, it seemed, and asked him how he would like it  if she were to make an offer it was all very hypothetical in the cautious  Italian style to adopt little Guido. Carlo's first instinct had been to say  that he wouldn't like it at all. But an answer like that would have been  too coarsely committal. He had preferred to say that he would think about  it. And now he was asking for our advice.   Do what you think best, was what in effect we replied. But we gave it  distantly but distinctly to be understood that we didn't think that Signora  Bondi would make a very good foster mother for the child. And Carlo  was inclined to agree. Besides he was very fond of the boy.   "But the thing is," he concluded rather gloomingly, "that if she has  really set her heart on getting hold of the child, there's nothing she won't  do to get him nothing."   He too, I could see, would have liked the physicists to start on unem  ployed childless woman of sanguine temperament before they tried to  tackle the atom. Still, I reflected, as I watched him striding away along  the terrace, singing powerfully from a brazen gullet as he went, there was  force there, there was life enough in those elastic limbs, behind those  bright gray eyes, to put up a good fight even against the accumulated  vital energies of Signora Bondi.   It was a few days after this that my gramophone and two or three  boxes of records arrived from England. They were a great comfort to us  on the hilltop, providing as they did the only thing in which that spiritually  fertile solitude otherwise a perfect Swiss Family Robinson's island  was lacking: music. There is not much music to be heard nowadays in  Florence. The times when Dr. Burney could tour through Italy, listening  to an unending succession of new operas, symphonies, quartets, cantatas,  are gone. Gone are the days when a learned musician, inferior only to the  Reverend Father Martini of Bologna, could admire what the peasants sang  and the strolling players thrummed and scraped on their instruments.  I have traveled for weeks through the peninsula and hardly heard a note  that was not Salome or the Fascists' song. Rich in nothing else that makes  life agreeable or even supportable, the northern metropolises are rich in  music. That is perhaps the only inducement that a reasonable man can  find for living there. The other attractions organized gaiety, people,  miscellaneous conversation, the social pleasures what are those, after all,  but an expense of spirit that buys nothing in return? And then the cold,  the darkness, the moldering dirt, the damp and squalor. . . . No, where     2234 Aldous Huxley   there is no necessity that retains, music can be the only inducement. And  that, thanks to the ingenious Edison, can now be taken about in a box  and unpacked in whatever solitude one chooses to visit. One can live at  Benin, or Nuneaton, or Tozeur in the Sahara, and still hear Mozart  quartets, and selections from The Well-Tempered Clavichord, and the  Fifth Symphony, and the Brahms clarinet quintet, and motets by  Palestrina.   Carlo, who had gone down to the station with his mule and cart to  fetch the packing case, was vastly interested in the machine.   "One will hear some music again," he said, as he watched me unpack  ing the gramophone and the disks. "It is difficult to do much oneself."   Still, I reflected, he managed to do a good deal. On warm nights we  used to hear him, where he sat at the door of his house, playing his guitar  and softly singing; the eldest boy shrilled out the melody on the mandolin  and sometimes the whole family would join in, and the darkness would  be filled with their passionate, throaty singing. Piedigrotta songs they  mostly sang; and the voices drooped slurringly from note to note, lazily  climbed or jerked themselves with sudden sobbing emphases from one  tone to another. At a distance and under the stars the effect was not  unpleasing.   "Before the war," he went on, "in normal times" (and Carlo had a  hope, even a belief, that the normal times were coming back and that life  would soon be as cheap and easy as it had been in the days before the  flood), "I used to go and listen to the operas at the Politeama. Ah, they  were magnificent. But it costs five lire now to get in."  "Too much," I agreed.  "Have you got TrovatoreT he asked.  I shook my head.  "Rigoletto?"  "Fm afraid not."   "Boheme? Fanciulla del West? Pagliacci?"  I had to go on disappointing him.  "Not even Normal Or the BarbiereT   I put on Battisrini in "La ci darem" out of Don Giovanni. He agreed  that the singing was good; but I could see that he didn't much like the  music, Why not? He found it difficult to explain.  "It's not like Pagliacci" he said at last.   "Not palpitating?" I suggested, using a word with which I was sure he  would be familiar; for it occurs in every Italian political speech and  patriotic leading article.   "Not palpitating," he agreed.   And I reflected that it is precisely by the difference between Pagliacci  and Don Giovanni, between the palpitating and the nonpalpitating, that     Young Archimedes 2235   modern music taste is separated from the old. The corruption of the best,  I thought, is the worst. Beethoven taught music to palpitate with his  intellectual and spiritual passion. It has gone on palpitating ever since,  but with the passion of inferior men. Indirectly, I thought, Beethoven is  responsible for Parsifal, Pagliacci, and the Poem of Fire\ still more indi  rectly for Samson and Delilah and "Ivy, cling to me." Mozart's melodies  may be brilliant, memorable, infectious; but they don't palpitate, don't  catch you between wind and water, don't send the listener off into erotic  ecstasies.   Carlo and his elder children found my gramophone, I am afraid, rather  a disappointment. They were too polite, however, to say so openly; they  merely ceased, after the first day or two, to take any interest in the  machine and the music it played. They preferred the guitar and their own  singing.   Guido, on the other hand, was immensely interested. And he liked, not  the cheerful dance tunes, to whose sharp rhythms our little Robin loved  to go stamping round and round the room, pretending that he was a whole  regiment of soldiers, but the genuine stuff. The first record he heard, I  remember, was that of the slow movement of Bach's Concerto in D Minor  for two violins. That was the disk I put on the turntable as soon as Carlo  had left me. It seemed to me, so to speak, the most musical piece of  music with which I would refresh my long-parched mind the coolest  and clearest of all draughts. The movement had just got under way and  was beginning to unfold its pure and melancholy beauties in accordance  with the laws of the most exacting intellectual logic, when the two chil  dren, Guido in front and little Robin breathlessly following, came clatter  ing into the room from the loggia.   Guido came to a halt in front of the gramophone and stood there,  motionless, listening. His pale blue-gray eyes opened themselves wide;  making a little nervous gesture that I had often noticed in him before,  he plucked at his lower lip with his thumb and forefinger. He must have  taken a deep breath; for I noticed that, after listening for a few seconds,  he sharply expired and drew in a fresh gulp of air. For an instant he  looked at me a questioning, astonished, rapturous look gave a little  laugh that ended in a kind of nervous shudder, and turned back towards  the source of the incredible sounds. Slavishly imitating his elder comrade,  Robin had also taken up his stand in front of the gramophone, and in  exactly the same position, glancing at Guido from time to time to make  sure that he was doing everything, down to plucking at his lip, hi the  correct way. But after a minute or so he became bored.   "Soldiers," he said, turning to me; "I want soldiers. Like in London."  He remembered the ragtime and the jolly marches round and round the  room.     2236 Aldous Huxley   I put my fingers to my lips. "Afterwards," I whispered.  Robin managed to remain silent and still for perhaps another twenty  seconds. Then he seized Guido by the arm, shouting, "Vieni, Guido!  Soldiers. Soldati. Vieni giuocare soldati"   It was then, for the first time, that I saw Guido impatient. "Vai!" he  whispered angrily, slapped at Robin's clutching hand and pushed him  roughly away. And he leaned a little closer to the instrument, as though  to make up by yet intenser listening for what the interruption had caused  him to miss.   Robin looked at him, astonished. Such a thing had never happened  before. Then he burst out crying and came to me for consolation.   When the quarrel was made up and Guido was sincerely repentant,  was as nice as he knew how to be when the music had stopped and his  mind was free to think of Robin once more I asked him how he liked  the music. He said he thought it was beautiful. But hello in Italian is too  vague a word, too easily and frequently uttered, to mean very much.   "What did you like best?" I insisted. For he had seemed to enjoy it so  much that I was curious to find out what had really impressed him.   He was silent for a moment, pensively frowning. "Well," he said at last,  "I liked the bit that went like this." And he hummed a long phrase. u And  then there's the other thing singing at the same time but what are those  things," he interrupted himself, "that sing like that?"  "They're called violins," I said.   "Violins." He nodded. "Well, the other violin goes like this." He  hummed again. "Why can't one sing both at once? And what is in that  box? What makes it make that noise?" The child poured out his questions.  I answered him as best I could, showing him the little spirals on the  disk, the needle, the diaphragm. I told him to remember how the string  of the guitar trembled when one plucked it; sound is a shaking in the air,  I told him, and I tried to explain how those shakings get printed on the  black disk. Guido listened to me very gravely, nodding from time to time.  I had the impression that he understood perfectly well everything I was  saying.   By this time, however, poor Robin was so dreadfully bored that in pity  for him I had to send the two children out into the garden to play. Guido  went obediently; but I could see that he would have preferred to stay  indoors and listen to more music. A little while later, when I looked out,  he was hiding in the dark recesses of the big bay tree, roaring like a lion,  and Robin laughing, but a little nervously, as though he were afraid that  the horrible noise might possibly turn out, after all, to be the roaring of a  real lion, was beating the bush with a stick, and shouting, "Come out,  come out! I want to shoot you."  After lunch, when Robin had gone upstairs for his afternoon sleep, he     Young Archimedes 2237   reappeared. "May I listen to music now?" he asked. And for an hour he  sat there in front of the instrument, his head cocked slightly on one side,  listening while I put on one disk after another.   Thenceforward he came every afternoon. Very soon he knew all my  library of records, had his preferences and dislikes, and could ask for  what he wanted by humming the principal theme.   "I don't like that one," he said of Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel "It's like  what we sing in our house. Not really like, you know. But somehow  rather like, all the same. You understand?" He looked at us perplexedly  and appealingly, as though begging us to understand what he meant and  so save him from going on explaining. We nodded. Guido went on. "And  then," he said, "the end doesn't seem to come properly out of the begin  ning. It's not like the one you played the first time." He hummed a bar or  two from the slow movement of Bach's D Minor Concerto.   "It isn't," I suggested, "like saying: All little boys like playing. Guido  is a little boy. Therefore Guido likes playing,"   He frowned. "Yes, perhaps that's it," he said at last. "The one you  played first is more like that. But, you know," he added, with an excessive  regard for truth, "I don't like playing as much as Robin does."   Wagner was among his dislikes; so was Debussy. When I played the  record of one of Debussy's arabesques, he said, "Why does he say the  same thing over and over again? He ought to say something new, or go on,  or make the thing grow. Can't he think of anything different?" But he was  less censorious about the Apres-midi d'un faune. "The things have beauti  ful voices," he said.   Mozart overwhelmed him with delight. The duet from Don Giovanni,  which his father had found insufficiently palpitating, enchanted Guido.  But he preferred the quartets and the orchestral pieces.   "I like music," he said, "better than singing."   Most people, I reflected, like singing better than music; are more inter  ested in the executant than in what he executes, and find the impersonal  orchestra less moving than the soloist. The touch of the pianist is the  human touch, and the soprano's high C is the personal note. It is for the  sake of this touch, that note, that audiences fill the concert halls.   Guido, however, preferred music. True, he liked "La ci darem"\ he  liked "Deh vieni alia finestra"\ he thought "Che soave zefiretto" so lovely  that almost all our concerts had to begin with it. But he preferred the  other things. The Figaro overture was one of his favorites. There is a  passage not far from the beginning of the piece, when the first violins  suddenly go rocketing up into the heights of loveliness; as the music  approached that point, I used always to see a smile developing and grad  ually brightening on Guide's face, and when, punctually, the thing hap  pened, he clapped his hands and laughed aloud with pleasure.     Aldous Huxley  2238   On the other side of the same disk, it happened, was recorded  Beethoven's Egmont overture. He liked that almost better than Figaro.   "It has more voices," he explained. And I was delighted by the acute-  ness of the criticism; for it is precisely in the richness of its orchestration  that Egmont goes beyond Figaro.   But what stirred him almost more than anything was the Coriolan  overture. The third movement of the Fifth Symphony, the second move  ment of the Seventh, the slow movement of the Emperor Concerto all  these things ran it pretty close. But none excited him so much as Coriolan.  One day he made me play it three or four times in succession; then he put   it away.   "I don't think I want to hear that any more," he said.   "Why not?"   "It's too ... too ..." he hesitated, "too big," he said at last. "I  don't really understand it. Play me the one that goes like this." He  hummed the phrase from the D Minor Concerto.   "Do you like that one better?" I asked.   He shook his head. "No, it's not that exactly. But it's easier."   "Easier?" It seemed to me rather a queer word to apply to Bach.   "I understand it better."   One afternoon, while we were in the middle of our concert, Signora  Bondi was ushered in. She began at once to be overwhelmingly affection  ate towards the child; kissed him, patted his head, paid him the most  outrageous compliments on his appearance. Guido edged away from  her.   "And do you like music?" she asked.   The child nodded.   "I think he has a gift," I said. "At any rate, he has a wonderful ear and  a power of listening and criticizing such as I've never met with in a child  of that age. We're thinking of hiring a piano for him to learn on."   A moment later I was cursing myself for my undue frankness in prais  ing the boy. For Signora Bondi began immediately to protest that, if she  could have the upbringing of the child, she would give him the best  masters, bring out his talent, make an accomplished maestro of him  and, on the way, an infant prodigy. And at that moment, I am sure, she  saw herself sitting maternally, in pearls and black satin, in the lea of the  huge Steinway, while an angelic Guido, dressed like little Lord Fauntleroy,  rattled out Liszt and Chopin to the loud delight of a thronged auditorium.  She saw the bouquets and all the elaborate floral tributes, heard the clap  ping and the few well-chosen words with which the veteran maestri,  touched almost to tears, would hail the coming of the little genius. It  became more than ever important for her to acquire the child.   "You've sent her away fairly ravening," said Elizabeth, when Signora     Young Archimedes 2239   Bondi had gone. "Better tell her next time that you made a mistake, and  that the boy's got no musical talent whatever."   In due course a piano arrived. After giving him the minimum of pre  liminary instruction, I let Guido loose on it. He began by picking out for  himself, the melodies he had heard, reconstructing the harmonies in which  they were embedded. After a few lessons, he understood the rudiments  of musical notation and could read a simple passage at sight, albeit very  slowly. The whole process of reading was still strange to him; he had  picked up his letters somehow, but nobody had yet taught him to read  whole words and sentences.   I took occasion, next time I saw Signora Bondi, to assure her that  Guido had disappointed me. There was nothing in his musical talent,  really. She professed to be very sorry to hear it; but I could see that she  didn't for a moment believe me. Probably she thought that we were after  the child too, and wanted to bag the infant prodigy for ourselves, before  she could get in her claim, thus depriving her of what she regarded almost  as her feudal right. For, after all, weren't they her peasants? If anyone  was to profit by adopting the child it ought to be herself.   Tactfully, diplomatically, she renewed her negotiations with Carlo. The  boy, she put it to him, had genius. It was the foreign gentleman who had  told her so, and he was the sort of man, clearly, who knew about such  things. If Carlo would let her adopt the, child, she'd have him trained.  He'd become a great maestro and get engagements in the Argentine and  the United States, in Paris and London. He'd earn millions and millions.  Think of Caruso, for example. Part of the millions, she explained, would  of course come to Carlo. But before they began to roll in, those millions,  the boy would have to be trained. But training was very expensive. In his  own interest, as well as that of his son, he ought to let her take charge of  the child. Carlo said he would think it over, and again applied to us for  advice. We suggested that it would be best in any case to wait a little and  see what progress the boy made.   He made, in spite of my assertions to Signora Bondi, excellent progress.  Every afternoon, while Robin was asleep, he came for his concert and his  lesson. He was getting along famously with his reading; his small fingers  were acquiring strength and agility. But what to me was more interesting  was that he had begun to make up little pieces on his own account. A  few of them I took down as he played them and I have them still. Most  of them, strangely enough, as I thought then, are canons. He had a passion  for canons. When I explained to him the principles of the form he was  enchanted.   "It is beautiful," he said, with admiration. "Beautiful, beautiful. And  so easy!"   Again the word surprised me. The canon is not, after all, so conspicu-     Aldotts Huxley  2240   ously simple. Thenceforward he spent most of his time at the piano in  working out little canons for his own amusement. They were often re  markably ingenious. But in the invention of other kinds of music he did  not show himself so fertile as I had hoped. He composed and harmonized  one or two solemn little airs like hymn tunes, with a few sprightlier pieces  in the spirit of the military march. They were extraordinary, of course,  as being the inventions of a child. But a great many children can do  extraordinary things; we are all geniuses up to the age of ten. But I had  hoped that Guido was a child who was going to be a genius at forty; in  which case what was extraordinary for an ordinary child was not extraor  dinary enough for him. "He's hardly a Mozart," we agreed, as we played  his little pieces over. I felt, it must be confessed, almost aggrieved. Any  thing less than a Mozart, it seemed to me, was hardly worth thinking  about.   He was not a Mozart. No. But he was somebody, as I was to find out,  quite as extraordinary. It was one morning in the early summer that I  made the discovery. I was sitting in the warm shade of our westward-  facing balcony, working. Guido and Robin were playing in the little en  closed garden below. Absorbed in my work, it was only, I suppose, after  the silence had prolonged itself a considerable time that I became aware  that the children were making remarkably little noise. There was no  shouting, no running about; only a quiet talking. Knowing by experience  that when children are quiet it generally means that they are absorbed in  some delicious mischief, I got up from my chair and looked over the  balustrade to see what they were doing. I expected to catch them dabbling  in water, making a bonfire, covering themselves with tar. But what I actu  ally saw was Guido, with a burnt stick in his hand, demontrating on the  smooth paving stones of the path, that the square on the hypotenuse of a  right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two  sides.   Kneeling on the floor, he was drawing with the point of his blackened  stick on the flagstones. And Robin, kneeling imitatively beside him, was  growing, I could see, rather impatient with this very slow game.   "Guido," he said. But Guido paid no attention. Pensively frowning, he  went on with his diagram. "Guido!" The younger child bent down and  then craned round his neck so as to look up into Guido's face. "Why  don't you draw a train?"   "Afterwards," said Guido. '"But I just want to show you this first. It's  so beautiful," he added cajolingly.   "But I want a train," Robin persisted.   "In a moment. Do just wait a moment." The tone was almost implor  ing. Robin armed himself with renewed patience. A minute later Guido  had finished both his diagrams.     Young Archimedes 2241   "There!" he said triumphantly, and straightened himself up to look at  them. "Now I'll explain."   And he preceded to prove the theorem of Pythagoras not in Euclid's  way, but by the simpler and more satisfying method which was, in all  probability, employed by Pythagoras himself. He had drawn a square and  dissected it, by a pair of crossed perpendiculars, into two squares and two  equal rectangles. The equal rectangles he divided up by their diagonals  into four equal right-angled triangles. The two squares are then seen to  be the squares on the two sides of any of these triangles other than the  hypothenuse. So much for the first diagram. In the next he took the four  right-angled triangles into which the rectangles had been divided and re  arranged them round the original square so that their right angles filled  the corners of the square, the hypotenuses looked inwards, and the  greater and less sides of the triangles were in continuation along the sides  of the squares (which are each equal to the sum of these sides). In this  way the original square is redissected into four right-angled triangles and  the square on the hypotenuse. The four triangles are equal to the two  rectangles of the original dissection. Therefore the square on the hypot  enuse is equal to the sum of the two squares the squares on the two  other sides into which, with the rectangles, the original square was first  dissected.   In very untechnical language, but clearly and with a relentless logic,  Guido expounded his proof. Robin listened, with an expression on his  bright, freckled face of perfect incomprehension.   "Treno," he repeated from time to time. "Treno. Make a train."   "In a moment," Guido implored. "Wait a moment. But do just look at  this. Do." He coaxed and cajoled. "It's so beautiful. It's so easy."   So easy . . . The theorem of Pythagoras seemed to explain for me  Guide's musical predilections. It was not an infant Mozart we had been  cherishing; it was a little Archimedes with, like most of his kind, an inci  dental musical twist.   "Treno, treno!" shouted Robin, growing more and more restless as the  exposition went on. And when Guido insisted on going on with his proof,  he lost his temper. "Cattivo Guido," he shouted, and began to hit out at  him with his fists.   "All right," said Guido resignedly. "I'll make a train." And with his  stick of charcoal he began to scribble on the stones.   I looked on for a moment in silence. It was not a very good train.  Guido might be able to invent for himself and prove the theorem of  Pythagoras: but he was not much of a draftsman.   "Guido!" I called. The two children turned and looked up, "Who taught  you to draw those squares?" It was conceivable, of course, that some  body might have taught him.     ^^ Aldous Huxley   "Nobody." He shook his head. Then, rather anxiously, as though he  were afraid there might be something wrong about drawing squares, he  went on to apologize and explain. "You see," he said, "it seemed to me  so beautiful. Because those squares" he pointed at the two small squares  in the first figure "are just as big as this one." And, indicating the square  on the hypotenuse in the second diagram, he looked up at me with a  deprecating smile.   I nodded. "Yes, it's very beautiful," I said "it's very beautiful indeed."   An expression of delighted relief appeared on his face; he laughed with   pleasure. "You see it's like this," he went on, eager to initiate me into   the glorious secret he had discovered. "You cut these two long squares"   he meant the rectangles "into two slices. And then there are four slices,   ail just the same, because, because Oh, I ought to have said that   before because these long squares are the same because those lines, you  see ..."   "But I want a train," protested Robin.   Leaning on the rail of the balcony, I watched the children below. I  thought of the extraordinary thing I had just seen and of what it meant.  I thought of the vast differences between human beings. We classify  men by the color of their eyes and hair, the shape of their skulls. Would  it not be more sensible to divide them up into intellectual species? There  would be even wider gulfs between the extreme mental types than between  a Bushman and a Scandinavian. This child, I thought, when he grows up,  will be to me, intellectually, what a man is to his dog. And there are other  men and women who are, perhaps, almost as dogs to me.   Perhaps the men of genius are the only true men. In all the history of  the race there have been only a few thousand real men. And the rest of  us what are we? Teachable animals. Without the help of the real man,  we should have found out almost nothing at all. Almost all the ideas with  which we are familiar could never have occurred to minds like ours. Plant  the seeds there and they will grow; but our minds could never spon  taneously have generated them.   There have been whole nations of dogs, I thought; whole epochs in  which no Man was born. From the dull Egyptians the Greeks took crude  experience and rules of thumb and made sciences. More than a thousand  years passed before Archimedes had a comparable successor. There has  been only one Buddha, one Jesus, only one Bach that we know of, one  Michelangelo.   Is it by a mere chance, I wondered, that a Man is born from time to  time? What causes a whole constellation of them to come contemporane  ously into being and from out of a single people? Taine thought that  Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael were born when they were because  the time was ripe for great painters and the Italian scene congenial. In the     Young Archimedes 2243   mouth of a rationalizing ninetenth-century Frenchman the doctrine is  strangely mystical; it may be none the less true for that. But what of those  born out of time? Blake, for example. What of those?   This child, I thought, has had the fortune to be born at a time when he  will be able to make good use of his capacities. He will find the most  elaborate analytical methods lying ready to his hand; he will have a pro  digious experience behind him. Suppose him born while Stonehenge was  building; he might have spent a lifetime discovering the rudiments, guess  ing darkly where now he might have had a chance of proving. Born at  the time of the Norman Conquest, he would have had to wrestle with  all the preliminary difficulties created by an inadequate symbolism; it  would have taken him long years, for example, to learn the art of dividing  MMMCCCCLXXXVin by MCMXIX. In five years, nowadays, he will  learn what it took generations of Men to discover.   And I thought of the fate of all the Men born so hopelessly out of  time that they could achieve little or nothing of value. Beethoven born  in Greece, I thought, would have had to be content to play thin melodies  on the flute or lyre; in those intellectual surroundings it would hardly have  been possible for him to imagine the nature of harmony.   From drawing trains, the children in the garden below had gone onto  playing trains. They were trotting round and round; with blown round  cheeks and pouting mouth like the cherubic symbol of a wind, Robin puff-  puffed and Guido, holding the skirt of his smock, shuffled behind him,  tooting. They ran forward, backed, stopped at imaginary stations, shunted,  roared over bridges, crashed through tunnels, met with occasional col  lisions and derailments. The young Archimedes seemed to be just as happy  as the little towheaded barbarian. A few minutes ago he had been busy  with the theorem of Pythagoras. Now, tooting indefatigably along imag  inary rails, he was perfectly content to shuffle backwards and forwards  among the flower beds, between the pillars of the loggia, in and out of  the dark tunnels of the laurel tree. The fact that one is going to be Archi  medes does not prevent one from being an ordinary cheerful child mean  while. I thought of this strange talent distinct and separate from the rest  of the mind, independent, almost, of experience. The typical child prodi  gies are musical and mathematical; the other talents ripen slowly under  the influence of emotional experience and growth. Till he was thirty Balzac  gave proof of nothing but ineptitude; but at four the young Mozart was  already a musician, and some of Pascal's most brilliant work was done  before he was out of his teens.   In the weeks that followed, I alternated the daily piano lessons with  lessons in mathematics. Hints rather than lessons they were; for I only  made suggestions, indicated methods, and left the child himself to work  out the ideas in detail. Thus I introduced him to algebra by showing     Aldous Huxley  2244   another proof of the theorem of Pythagoras. In this proof one drops a  perpendicular from the right angle on to the hypotenuse, and arguing from  the fact that the two triangles thus created are similar to one another and  to the original triangle, and that the proportions which their corresponding  sides bear to one another are therefore equal, one can show m algebraical  form that C 2 -f- D a (the squares on the other two sides) are equal to  A a + B 2 (the squares on the two segments of the hypotenuses) + 2AB;  which last, it is easy to show geometrically, is equal to (A 4- B) 2 , or the  square on the hypotenuse. Guido was as much enchanted by the rudi  ments of algebra as he would have been if I had given him an engine  worked by steam, with a methylated spirit lamp to heat the boiler; more  enchanted, perhaps for the engine would have got broken, and, remaining  always itself, would in any case have lost its charm, while the rudiments  of algebra continued to grow and blossom in his mind with an unfailing  luxuriance. Every day he made the discovery of something which seemed  to him exquisitely beautiful; the new toy was inexhaustible in its poten  tialities,   In the intervals of applying algebra to the second book of Euclid, we  experimented with circles; we stuck bamboos into the parched earth,  measured their shadows at different hours of the day, and drew exciting  conclusions from our observations. Sometimes, for fun, we cut and folded  sheets of paper so as to make cubes and pyramids. One afternoon Guido  arrived carrying carefully between his small and rather grubby hands a  flimsy dodecahedron.   "E tanto betto!" he said, as he showed us his paper crystal; and when I  asked him how he had managed to make it, he merely smiled and said it  had been so easy. I looked at Elizabeth and laughed. But it would have  been more symbolically to the point, I felt, if I had gone down on all  fours, wagged the spiritual outgrowth of my os coccyx, and barked my  astonished admiration.   It was an uncommonly hot summer. By the beginning of July our little  Robin, unaccustomed to these high temperatures, began to look pale and  tired; he was listless, had lost his appetite and energy. The doctor advised  mountain air. We decided to spend the next ten or twelve weeks in Switz  erland. My parting gift to Guido was the first six books of Euclid in  Italian. He turned over the pages, looking ecstatically at the figures.   "If only I knew how to read properly," he said. "I'm so stupid. But now  I shall really try to learn."   From our hotel near Grindelwald we sent the child, in Robin's name,  various postcards of cows, alphorns, Swiss chalets, edelweiss, and the like.  We received no answers to these cards; but then we did not expect an  swers. Guido could not write, and there was no reason why his father or  his sisters should take the trouble to write for him. No news, we took it,     Young Archimedes 2245   was good news. And then one day, early in September, there arrived at  the hotel a strange letter. The manager had it stuck up on the glass-fronted  notice board in the hall, so that all the guests might see it, and whoever  conscientiously thought that it belonged to him might claim it. Passing  the board on the way in to lunch, Elizabeth stopped to look at it.   "But it must be from Guido," she said.   I came and looked at the envelope over her shoulder. It was unstamped  and black with postmarks. Traced out in pencil, the big uncertain capital  letters sprawled across its face. In the first line was written: AL BABBO DI  ROBIN, and there followed a travestied version of the name of the hotel  and the place. Round the address bewildered postal officials had scrawled  suggested emendations. The letter had wandered for a fortnight at least,  back and forth across the face of Europe.   "Al Babbo di Robin. To Robin's father." I laughed. "Pretty smart of  the postmen to have got it here at all." I went to the manager's office, set  forth the justice of my claim to the letter and, having paid the fifty-centime  surcharge for the missing stamp, had the case unlocked and the letter  given me. We went into lunch.   "The writing's magnificent," we agreed, laughing, as we examined the  address at close quarters. "Thanks to Euclid," I added. "That's what comes  of pandering to the ruling passion."   But when I opened the envelope and looked at its contents I no longer  laughed. The letter was brief and almost telegraphic in style. SONO DALLA  PADRONA, it ran, NON MI PIACE HA RUBATO IL MIO LIBRO NON VOGLIO   SUONARE PIU VOGLIO TORNARE A CASA VENGA SUBITO GUIDO.   "What is it?"   I handed Elizabeth the letter. "That blasted woman's got hold of him,"  I said.   Busts of men in Homburg hats, angels bathed in marble tears extin  guishing torches, statues of little girls, cherubs, veiled figures, allegories  and ruthless realisms the strangest and most diverse idols beckoned and  gesticulated as we passed. Printed indelibly on tin and embedded in the  living rock, the brown photographs looked out, under glass, from the  humbler crosses, headstones, and broken pillars. Dead ladies in cubistic  geometrical fashions of thirty years ago two cones of black satin meeting  point to point at the waist, and the arms: a sphere to the elbow, a pol  ished cylinder below smiled mournfully out of their marble frames; the  smiling frames; the smiling faces, the white hands, were the only recogniz  ably human things that emerged from the solid geometry of their clothes.  Men with black mustaches, men with white beards, young cleanshaven  men, stared or averted their gaze to show a Roman profile. Children in  their stiff best opened wide their eyes, smiled hopefully in anticipation of     Aldous Huxley  2246   the little bird that was to issue from the camera's muzzle, smiled skepti  cally in the knowledge that it wouldn't, smiled laboriously and obediently  because they had been told to. In spiky Gothic cottages of marble the  richer dead reposed; through grilled doors one caught a glimpse of pale  Inconsolables weeping, of distraught Geniuses guarding the secret of the  tomb. The less prosperous sections of the majority slept in communities,  close-crowded but elegantly housed under smooth continuous marble  floors, whose every flagstone was the mouth of a separate grave.   These Continental cemeteries, I thought, as Carlo and I made our way  among the dead, are more frightful than ours, because these people pay  more attention to their dead than we do. That primordial cult of corpses,  that tender solicitude for their material well-being, which led the ancients  to house their dead in stone, while they themselves lived between wattles  and under thatch, still lingers here; persists, I thought, more vigorously  than with us. There are a hundred gesticulating statues here for every one  in an English graveyard. There are more family vaults, more "luxuriously  appointed" (as they say of liners and hotels) than one would find at home.  And embedded in every tombstone there are photographs to remind the  powdered bones within what form they will have to resume on the Day  of Judgment; beside each are little hanging lamps to burn optimistically  on All Souls* Day. To the Man who built the Pyramids they are nearer,  I thought, than we.   "If I had known," Carlo kept repeating, "if only I had known." His  voice came to me through my reflections as though from a distance. "At  the time he didn't mind at all. How should I have known that he would  take it so much to heart afterwards? And she deceived me, she lied  to me."   I assured him yet once more that it wasn't his fault. Though, of course,  it was, in part. It was mine too, in part; I ought to have thought of the  possibility and somehow guarded against it. And he shouldn't have let the  child go, even temporarily and on trial, even though the woman was bring  ing pressure to bear on him. And the pressure had been considerable.  They had worked on the same holding for more than a hundred years,  the men of Carlo's family; and now she had made the old man threaten  to turn him out. It would be a dreadful thing to leave the place; and be  sides, another place wasn't so easy to find. It was made quite plain, how  ever, that he could stay if he let her have the child. Only for a little to  begin with; just to see how he got on. There would be no compulsion  whatever on him to stay if he didn't like it. And it would be all to Guide's  advantage; and to his father's, too, in the end. All that the Englishman  had said about his not being such a good musician as he had thought at  first was obviously untrue mere jealousy and little-mindedness: the man  wanted to take credit for Guido himself, that was all. And the boy, it     Young Archimedes 2247   was obvious, would learn nothing from him. What he needed was a real  good professional master.   All the energy that, if the physicists had known their business, would  have been driving dynamos, went into this campaign. It began the moment  we were out of the house, intensively. She would have more chance of  success, the Signora doubtless thought, if we weren't there. And besides,  it was essential to take the opportunity when it offered itself and get hold  of the child before we could make our bid for it was obvious to her that  we wanted Guido just as much as she did.   Day after day she renewed the assault. At the end of a week she sent  her husband to complain about the state of the vines: they were in a  shocking condition; he had decided, or very nearly decided, to give Carlo  notice. Meekly, shamefacedly, in obedience to higher orders, the old  gentleman uttered his threats. Next day Signora Bondi returned to the  attack. The padrone, she declared, had been in a towering passion; but  she'd do her best, her very best, to mollify him. And after a significant  pause she went on to talk about Guido.   In the end Carlo gave in. The woman was too persistent and she held  too many trump cards. The child could go and stay with her for a month  or two on trial. After that, if he really expressed a desire to remain with  her, she would formally adopt him.   At the idea of going for a holiday to the seaside and it was to the sea  side, Signora Bondi told him, that they were going Guido was pleased  and excited. He had heard a lot about the sea from Robin. "Tanta acqua!"  It had sounded almost too good to be true. And now he was actually to  go and see this marvel. It was very cheerfully that he parted from his  family.   But after the holiday by the sea was over, and Signora Bondi had  brought him back to her town house in Florence, he began to be home  sick. The Signora, it was true, treated him exceedingly kindly, bought him  new clothes, took him out to tea in the Via Tornabuoni and filled him up  with cakes, iced strawbeny-ade, whipped cream, and chocolates. But she  made him practice the piano more than he liked, and what was worse, she  took away his Euclid, on the score that he wasted too much time with it.  And when he said that he wanted to go home, she put him off with prom  ises and excuses and downright lies. She told him that she couldn't take  him at once, but that next week, if he were good and worked hard at his  piano meanwhile, next week . . . And when the time came she told him  that his father didn't want him back. And she redoubled her petting, gave  him expensive presents, and stuffed him with yet unhealthier foods. To no  purpose. Guido didn't like his new life, didn't want to practice scales,  pined for his book, and longed to be back with his brothers and sisters.  Signora Bondi, meanwhile, continued to hope that time and chocolates     Aldous Huxley     would eventually make the child hers; and to keep his family at a distance,  she wrote to Carlo every few days letters which still purported to come  from the seaside (she took the trouble to send them to a friend, who  posted them back again to Florence), and in which she painted the most  charming picture of Guido's happiness.   It was then that Guide wrote his letter to me. Abandoned, as he sup  posed, by his family for that they should not take the trouble to come  to see him when they were so near was only to be explained on the  hypothesis that they really had given him up he must have looked to me  as his last and only hope. And the letter, with its fantastic address, had  been nearly a fortnight on its way. A fortnight it must have seemed hun  dreds of years; and as the centuries succeeded one another, gradually, no  doubt, the poor child became convinced that I too had abandoned him.  There was no hope left.  "Here we are,'* said Carlo.   I looked up and found myself confronted by an enormous monument.  In a kind of grotto hollowed in the flanks of a monolith of gray sandstone,  Sacred Love, in bronze, was embracing a funeral urn. And in bronze  letters riveted into the stone was a long legend to the effect that the incon  solable Ernesto Bondi had raised this monument to the memory of his  beloved wife, Anunziata, as a token of his undying love for one whom,  snatched from him by a premature death, he hoped very soon to join  beneath this stone. The first Signora Bondi had died in 1912. I thought  of the old man leashed to his white dog; he must always, I reflected, have  been a most uxorious husband.  "They buried him here."   We stood there for a long time in silence, I felt the tears coming into  my eyes as I thought of the poor child lying there underground. I thought  of those luminous grave eyes, and the curve of that beautiful forehead,  the droop of the melancholy mouth, of the expression of delight which  illumined his face when he learned of some new idea that pleased him,  when he heard a piece of music that he liked. And this beautiful small  being was dead; and the spirit that inhabited this form, the amazing spirit,   that too had been destroyed almost before it had begun to exist.  And the unhappiness that must have preceded the final act, the child's   despair, the conviction of his utter abandonment those were terrible to   think of, terrible.   'i think v\* had better come away now," I said at last, and touched   Carlo on the arm. He was standing there like a blind man, his eyes shut,   his face slightly lifted towards the light; from between his closed eyelids   the tears welled out, hung for a moment, and trickled down his cheeks.   His lips trembled and I could see that he was making an effort to keep   them still. "Come away," I repeated.     Young Archimedes 2249   The face which had been still in its sorrow was suddenly convulsed;  he opened his eyes, and through the tears they were bright with a violent  anger. "I shall kill her," he said, "I shall kill her. When I think of him  throwing himself out, falling through the air ..." With his two hands he  made a violent gesture, bringing them down from over his head and  arresting them with a sudden jerk when they were on the level with his  breast. "And then crash." He shuddered. "She's as much responsible as  though she had pushed him down herself. I shall kill her." He clenched  his teeth.   To be angry is easier than to be sad, less painful. It is comforting to  think of revenge. "Don't talk like that," I said. "It's no good. It's stupid.  And what would be the point?" He had had those lists before, when grief  became too painful and he had tried to escape from it. Anger had been  the easiest way of escape. I had had, before this, to persuade him back  into the harder path of grief. 'It's stupid to talk like that," I repeated, and  I led him away through the ghastly labyrinth of tombs, where death  seemed more terrible even than it is.   By the time we had left the cemetery, and were walking down from  San Miniato towards the Piazzale Michelangelo below, he had become  calmer. His anger had subsided again into the sorrow from which it had  derived all its strength and its bitterness. In the Piazzale we halted for a  moment to look down at the city in the valley below us. It was a day of  floating clouds great shapes, white, golden, and gray; and between them  patches of a thin, transparent blue. Its lantern level, almost, with our eyes,  the dome of the cathedral revealed itself in all its grandiose lightness, its  vastness and aerial strength. On the innumerable brown and rosy roofs of  the city the afternoon sunlight lay softly, sumptuously, and the towers  were as though varnished and enameled with an old gold. I thought of all  the Men who had lived here and left the visible traces of their spirit and  conceived extraordinary things. I thought of the dead child.     COMMENTARY ON   Mr. Fortune     rr^ HE Reverend Timothy Fortune had been a bank clerk but his heart  1 was set neither on riches nor advancement. When, at middle age, a  small sum was left to him by an aunt, he went to a training college  was ordained a deacon and quitted England to become a missionary at  St Fabien, a port on an island of the fictional Raritongan Archipelago in  the Pacific. After a time he felt the call to go to Fanua, a small, remote  island, to make Christians of its peaceful, childlike natives. Mr. Fortune  was a humble man and easygoing. "Even as a young man he had learnt  that to jump in first doesn't make the bus start any sooner; and his  favorite psalm was the one which begins: My soul truly waitest still upon  God." He intended no pressure to convert the islanders. He knew they  were a happy people; after he had dwelt among them, he thought, they  would come to him and he would teach them "how they might be as  happy in another life as they were in this."   Three years Mr. Fortune spent on Fanua; he made not a single convert.  At first he thought he had converted a beautiful native boy named Lueli;  he loved the boy and was loved by him. But one day he discovered that  Lueli had only feigned to be a Christian so as not to offend Mr. Fortune;  "in secret, in the reality of secretness," he continued to worship an idol.  Mr. Fortune was angry, then puzzled, and finally ashamed of his failure. It  was clear that he himself was unworthy and this failure his punishment.  His tormenting reflections were interrupted by a terrific earthquake that  suddenly struck the island. The hut he occupied collapsed and but for  Luelf s efforts, at the risk of his life, Mr. Fortune would have perished.  The earthquake had awful consequences for both the boy and the priest.  The fire in the hut had destroyed Lueli's idol which he might have saved  had he not thought first of his friend's safety; the hideous shaking of the  earth, "the flames, that had burst roaring and devouring from the moun  tain top" had also destroyed Mr. Fortune's belief in God. He had "de  parted in clouds of smoke, He had gone up and was lost in space."   Lueli felt the loss of the idol more acutely than Mr. Fortune the evapo  ration of his faith. The boy was listless and utterly miserable. His friends  teased him for having lost his God. Mr. Fortune knew he must find ways  to draw Lueli from his despair. "After three years of such familiarity it  would not be easy to reconstruct his first fascination as something rich and  strange. But it must be done if he were to compete successfully with his  rival in Lueli's affections. It must be done because that rival was death."  He tried to bring about a change in Lueli's mood by introducing him to     2250     Mr. Fortune 2251   games: ping-pong, spellikins, dicing, skittles. He caught a baby flying-fox  and reared it for Lueli as a pet. He introduced him, with the aid of a mag  nifying glass, to the wonderful details of natural history. Nothing worked.  Lueli got hit in the nose playing ping-pong, stoutly resisted spellikins, was  bored by dicing and was regularly scratched and bitten by the fox. Then  one morning Mr. Fortune remembered mathematics. The sequel to this  inspiration is recounted in the excerpt below, taken from Sylvia Townsend  Warner's gentle satire, Mr. Fortune's Maggot. It is a witty, enchanting  episode of modern literature.     He knew what's what, and thafs as high   As metaphysic wit can fly. SAMUEL BUTLER (fludibras)     3 Geometry in the South Pacific   By SYLVIA TOWNSEND WARNER   [EXCERPT FROM "MR. FORTUNE'S MAGGOT"]     AND then one morning when they had been living in the new hut for about  six weeks he [Mr. Fortune] woke up inspired. Why had he wasted so much  time displaying his most trivial and uncompelling charms, opposing to the  magnetism of death such fripperies and titbits of this world, such gew  gaws of civilization as a path serpentining to a parrot-cote (a parrot-cote  which hadn't even allured the parrots), or a pocket magnifying glass,  while all the time he carried within him the inestimable treasures of intel  lectual enjoyment? Now he would pipe Lueli a tune worth dancing to,  now he would open for him a new world. He would teach him mathe  matics.   He sprang up from bed, full of enthusiasm. At the thought of all those  stretches of white beach he was like a bridegroom. There they were, hard  and smooth from the tread of the sea, waiting for that noble consumma  tion of blank surfaces, to show forth a truth; waiting, in this particular  instance, to show forth the elements of plane geometry.   At breakfast Mr. Fortune was so glorified and gay that Lueli caught a  reflection of his high spirits and began to look more life-like than he had  done for weeks. On their way down to the beach they met a party of  islanders who were off on a picnic. Mr. Fortune with delight heard Lueli  answering their greetings with something like his former sociability, and  even plucking up heart enough for a repartee. His delight gave a momen  tary stagger when Lueli decided to go a-picnicking too. But, after all, it  didn't matter a pin. The beach would be as smooth again to-morrow, the  air as sweet and nimble; Lueli would be in better trim for learning after a  spree, and, now he came to think of it, he himself wouldn't teach any the  worse for a little private rubbing-up beforehand.   It must be going on for forty years since he had done any mathematics;  for he had gone into the Bank the same year that his father died, leaving  Rugby at seventeen because, in the state that things were then in, the Bank  was too good an opening to be missed. He had once got a prize The  Poetical Works of Longfellowfor Algebra, and he had scrambled along  well enough in other branches of mathematics; but he had not learnt with   2252     Geometry in the South Pacific 2253   any particular thrill or realized that thrill there might be until he was in  the Bank, and learning a thing of the past.   Then, perhaps because of that never-ending entering and adding up and  striking balances, and turning on to the next page to enter, add up and  strike balances again, a mental occupation minute, immediate and yet, so  to speak, wool-gathering, as he imagined knitting to be, the absolute  quality of mathematics began to take on for him an inexpressibly ro  mantic air. "Pure Mathematics." He used to speak of them to his fellow  clerks as though he were hinting at some kind of transcendental de  bauchery of which he had been made free and indeed there does seem  to be a kind of unnatural vice in being so completely pure. After a spell  of this holy boasting he would grow a little uneasy; and going to the Free  Library he took out mathematical treatises, just to make sure that he could  follow step by step as well as soar. For twenty pages perhaps, he read  slowly, carefully, dutifully, with pauses for self-examination and working  out the examples. Then, just as it was working up and the pauses should  have been more scrupulous than ever, a kind of swoon and ecstasy would  fall on him, and he read ravening on, sitting up till dawn to finish the  book, as though it were a novel. After that his passion was stayed; the  book went back to the Library and he was done with mathematics till the  next bout. Not much remained with him after these orgies, but something  remained: a sensation in the mind, a worshipping acknowledgment of  something isolated and unassailable, or a remembered mental joy at the  Tightness of thoughts coming together to a conclusion, accurate thoughts,  thoughts in just intonation, coming together like unaccompanied voices  coming to a close.   But often his pleasure flowered from quite simple things that any fool  could grasp. For instance he would look out of the bank windows, which  had green shades in their lower halves; and rising above the green shades  he would see a row of triangles, equilateral, isosceles, acute-angled, right-  angled, obtuse-angled. These triangles were a range of dazzling mountain  peaks, eternally snowy, eternally untrodden; and he could feel the keen  wind which blew from their summits. Yet they were also a row of tri  angles, equilateral, isosceles, acute-angled, right-angled, obtuse-angled.   This was the sort of thing he designed for Lueli's comfort. Geometry  would be much better than algebra, though he had not the same certificate  from Longfellow for teaching it. Algebra is always dancing over the pit  of the unknown, and he had no wish to direct Lueli's thoughts to that  quarter. Geometry would be best to begin with, plain plane geometry,  immutably plane. Surely if anything could minister to the mind diseased  it would be the steadfast contemplation of a right angle, an existence that  no mist of human tears could blur, no blow of fate deflect.   Walking up and down the beach, admiring the surface which to-morrow     Sylvia Townsend Warner   with so much epiphany and glory was going to reveal the first axioms of  Euclid, Mr. Fortune began to think of himself as possessing an universal  elixir and charm, A wave of missionary ardour swept him along and he  seemed to view, not Lueli only, but all the islanders rejoicing in this new  dispensation. There was beach-board enough for all and to spare. The  picture grew in his mind's eye, somewhat indebted to Raphael's Cartoon  of the School of Athens. Here a group bent over an equation, there they  pointed out to each other with admiration that the square on the hypote  nuse equalled the sum of the squares on the sides containing the right  angle; here was one delighting in a rhomboid and another in conic sections,  that enraptured figure had secured the twelfth root of two, while the chil  dren might be filling up the foreground with a little long division.   By the morrow he had slept off most of his fervour. Calm, methodical,  with a mind prepared for the onset, he guided Lueli down to the beach  and with a stick prodded a small hole in it.   "What is this?"   "A hole."   "No, Lueli, it may seem like a hole, but it is a point."   Perhaps he had prodded a little too emphatically. Lueii's mistake was  quite natural. Anyhow, there were bound to be a few misunderstandings  at the start.   "He took out his pocket knife and whittled the end of the stick. Then  he tried again.   "What is this?"   "A smaller hole."   "Point," said Mr. Fortune suggestively.   "Yes, I mean a smaller point."   "No, not quite. It is a point, but it is not smaller. Holes may be of dif  ferent sizes, but no point is larger or smaller than another point."   Lueli looked from the first point to the second. He seemed to be about  to speak, but to think better of it. He removed his gaze to the sea.   Meanwhile, Mr. Fortune had moved about, prodding more points. It  was rather awkward that he should have to walk on the beach-board,  for his footmarks distracted the eye from the demonstration.   "Look, Lueli!"   Lueli turned his gaze inland.   "Where?" said he.   "At all these. Here; and here; and here. But don't tread on them."   Lueli stepped back hastily. When he was well out of the danger-zone  he stood looking at Mr. Fortune with great attention and some uneasiness.   "These are all points."   Lueli recoiled a step further. Standing on one leg he furtively inspected  the sole of his foot.     Geometry in the South Pacific 2255   "As you see, Lueli, these points are in different places. This one is to  the west of that and consequently that one is to the east of this. Here is  one to the south. Here are two close together, and there is one quite  apart from all the others. Now look at them, remember what I have said,  think carefully and tell me what you think."   Inclining his head and screwing up his eyes Lueli inspected the demon  stration with an air of painstaking connoisseurship. At length he ventured  the opinion that the hole lying apart from the others was perhaps the  neatest. But if Mr. Fortune would give him the knife he would whittle the  stick even finer.   "Now what did I tell you? Have you forgotten that points cannot be  larger or smaller? If they were holes it would be a different matter. But  these are points. Will you remember that?"   Lueli nodded. He parted his lips, he was about to ask a question.  Mr. Fortune went on hastily.   "Now suppose I were to cover the whole beach with these: what then?"   A look of dismay came over Lueli's countenance. Mr. Fortune with  drew the hypothesis.   "I don't intend to. I only ask you to imagine what it would be like if  I did."   The look of dismay deepened.   "They would all be points,'* said Mr. Fortune, impressively. "All in  different places. And none larger or smaller than another.   "What I have explained to you is summed up in the axiom: a point has  position but not magnitude. In other words if a given point were not in  a given place it would not be there at all."   Whilst allowing time for this to sink in he began to muse about those  other words. Were they quite what he meant? Did they indeed mean any  thing? Perhaps it would have been better not to try to supplement Euclid.  He turned to his pupil. The last words had sunk in at any rate, had been  received without scruple and acted upon. Lueli was out of sight.   Compared with his intentions actuality had been a little quelling. It  became more quelling as time went on. Lueli did not again remove him  self without leave; he soon discovered that Mr. Fortune was extremely  in earnest, and was resigned to regular instruction every morning and a  good deal of rubbing-in and evocation during the rest of the day. No one  ever had a finer capacity for listening than he, or a more docile and  obliging temperament. But whereas in the old days these good gifts had  flowed from him spontaneously and pleasurably he now seemed to be ex  hibiting them by rote and in a manner almost desperate, as though he  were listening and obliging as a circus animal does its tricks. Humane  visitors to circuses often point out with what alacrity the beasts run into  the ring to perform their turn. They do not understand that in the choice     Sylvia Townsend Warner  2256   of two evils most animals would rather flourish round a spacious ring  than be shut up in a cage. The activity and the task is a distraction from  their unnatural lot, and they tear through paper hoops all the better be  cause so much of their time is spent behind iron bars.   It had been a very different affair when Lueli was learning Bible history  and the Church Catechism, The King of Love my Shepherd is and The  Old Hundredth. Then there had been no call for this blatant submission;  lessons had been an easy-going conversation, with Lueli keeping his end  up as an intelligent pupil should and Mr. Fortune feeling like a cross be  tween wise old Chiron and good Mr. Barlow. Now they were a succession  of harangues, and rather strained harangues to boot. Theology, Mr. For  tune found, is a more accommodating subject than mathematics; its tech  nique of exposition allows greater latitude. For instance when you are  gravelled for matter there is always the moral to fall back upon. Com  parisons too may be drawn, leading cases cited, types and antetypes  analysed and anecdotes introduced. Except for Archimedes mathematics is  singularly naked of anecdotes.   Not that he thought any the worse of it for this. On the contrary he  compared its austere and integral beauty to theology decked out in her  flaunting charms and wielding all her bribes and spiritual bonuses; and  like Dante at the rebuke of Beatrice he blushed that he should ever have  followed aught but the noblest. No, there was nothing lacking in mathe  matics. The deficiency was in him. He added line to line, precept to pre  cept; he exhausted himself and his pupil by hours of demonstration and  exposition; leagues of sand were scarred, and smoothed again by the tide,  and scarred afresh: never an answering spark rewarded him. He might as  well have made the sands into a rope-walk.   Sometimes he thought that he was taxing Lueli too heavily, and desisted.  But if he desisted for pity's sake, pity soon drove him to work again, for  if it were bad to see Lueli sighing over the properties of parallel lines, it  was worse to see him moping and pining for his god. Teioa's words,  uttered so matter-of-factly, haunted his mind. "I expect he will die soon."  Mr. Fortune was thinking so too. Lueli grew steadily more lacklustre, his  eyes were dull, his voice was flat; he appeared to be retreating behind a  film that thickened and toughened and would soon obliterate him.   "If only, if only I could teach him to enjoy an abstract notion! If he  could once grasp how it all hangs together, and is everlasting and har  monious, he would be saved. Nothing else can save him, nothing that I  or his fellows can offer him. For it must be new to excite him and it must  be true to hold him, and what else is there that is both new and true?"   There were women, of course, a race of beings neither new nor true,  yet much vaunted by some as a cure for melancholy and a tether for the     Geometry in the South Pacific 2257   soul. Mr. Fortune would have cheerfully procured a damsel (not that  they were likely to need much of that), dressed her hair, hung the whistle  and the Parnell medal round her neck, dowered her with the nineteen  counters and the tape measure and settled her in Lueli's bed if he had sup  posed that this would avail. But he feared that Lueli was past the comfort  of women, and in any case that sort of thing is best arranged by the  parties concerned.   So he resorted to geometry again, and once more Lueli was hurling  himself with frantic docility through the paper hoops. It was really rather  astonishing, how dense he could be! Once out of twenty, perhaps, he  would make the right answer. Mr. Fortune, too anxious to be lightly  elated, would probe a little into his reasons for making it. Either they  were the wrong reasons or he had no reasons at all. Mr. Fortune was often  horribly tempted to let a mistake pass. He was not impatient: he was far  more patient than in the palmiest days of theology but he found it almost  unendurable to be for ever saying with various inflexions of kindness:  "No, Lueli. Try again," or: "Well, no, not exactly," or: "I fear you have  not quite understood," or: "Let me try to make that clearer." He with  stood the temptation. His easy acceptance (though in good faith) of a  sham had brought them to this pass, and tenderness over a false currency  was not likely to help them out of it. No, he would not be caught that way  twice. Similarly he pruned and repressed Lueli's talent for leaking away  down side-issues, though this was hard too, for it involved snubbing him  almost every time he spoke on his own initiative.   Just as he had been so mistaken about the nature of points, confound  ing them with holes and agitating himself at the prospect of a beach pitted  all over, Lueli contrived to apply the same sort of well-meaning misconcep  tions to every stage of his progress if progress be the word to apply to  one who is hauled along in a state of semiconsciousness by the scruff of  his neck. When the points seemed to be tolerably well-established in his  mind Mr. Fortune led him on to lines, and by joining up points he illus  trated such simple figures as the square, the triangle and the parallelogram.  Lueli perked up, seemed interested, borrowed the stick and began joining  up points too. At first he copied Mr. Fortune, glancing up after each  stroke to see if it had been properly directed. Then growing rather more  confident, and pleased as who is not? with the act of drawing on sand,  he launched out into a more complicated design.   "This is a man," he said.   Mr. Fortune was compelled to reply coldly:   "A man is not a geometrical figure."   At length Mr. Fortune decided that he had better take in sail. Pure  mathematics were obviously beyond Lueli; perhaps applied mathematics     Sylvia Townsend Warner  2258   would work better. Mr. Fortune, as it happened, had never applied any,  but he knew that other people did so, and though he considered it a  rather lower line of business he was prepared to try it.   "If I were to ask you to find out the height of that tree, how would  you set about it?"   Lueli replied with disconcerting readiness:   "I should climb up to the top and let down a string."   "But suppose you couldn't climb up it?"   "Then I should cut it down."   "That would be very wasteful: and the other might be dangerous. I can  show you a better plan than either of those,"   The first thing was to select a tree, an upright tree, because in all ele  mentary demonstrations it is best to keep things as clear as possible. He  would never have credited the rarity of upright trees had he not been  pressed to find one. Coco-palms, of course, were hopeless: they all had a  curve or a list. At length he remembered a tree near the bathing-pool, a  perfect specimen of everything a tree should be, tall, straight as a die,  growing by itself; set apart, as it were, for purposes of demonstration.   He marched Lueli thither, and when he saw him rambling towards the  pool he recalled him with a cough.   "Now I will show you how to discover the height of that tree. Attend.  You will find it very interesting. The first thing to do is to lie down."   Mr. Fortune lay down on his back and Lueli followed his example.   Many people find that they can think more clearly in a recumbent posi  tion. Mr. Fortune found it so too. No sooner was he on his back than  he remembered that he had no measuring stick. But the sun was delicious  and the grass soft; he might well spare a few minutes in exposing the  theory.   "It is all a question of measurements. Now my height is six foot two  inches, but for the sake of argument we will assume it to be six foot ex  actly. The distance from my eye to the base of the tree is so far an  unknown quantity. My six feet however are already known to you."   Now Lueli had sat up, and was looking him up and down with an in  tense and curious scrutiny, as though he were something utterly un  familiar. This was confusing, it made him lose the thread of his explana  tion. He felt a little uncertain as to how it should proceed.   Long ago on dark January mornings, when a septic thumb (bestowed  on him by a cat which he had rescued from a fierce poodle) obliged him  to stay away from the Bank, he had observed young men with woollen  comforters and raw-looking wind-bitten hands practising surveying under  the snarling elms and whimpering poplars of Finsbury Park. They had  tapes and tripods, and the girls in charge of perambulators dawdled on the"  asphalt paths to watch their proceedings. It was odd how vividly frag-     Geometry in the South Pacific 2259   ments of his old life had been coming back to him during these last few  months.   He resumed:   "In order to ascertain the height of the tree I must be in such a position  that the top of the tree is exactly in a line with the top of a measuring-  stick or any straight object would do, such as an umbrella which I  shall secure in an upright position between my feet. Knowing then that  the ratio that the height of the tree bears to the length of the measuring-  stick must equal the ratio that the distance from my eye to the base of the  tree bears to my height, and knowing (or being able to find out) my  height, the length of the measuring stick and the distance from my eye  to the base of the tree, I can, therefore, calculate the height of the tree."   "What is an umbrella?"   Again the past flowed back, insurgent and actual. He was at the Oval,  and out of an overcharged sky it had begun to rain again. In a moment  the insignificant tapestry of lightish faces was exchanged for a noble pat  tern of domes, blackish, blueish and greenish domes, sprouting like a crop  of miraculous and religious mushrooms. The rain fell harder and harder,  presently the little white figures were gone from the field and, as with an  abnegation of humanity, the green plain, so much smaller for their de  parture, lay empty and forsaken, ringed round with tier upon tier of  blackly glistening umbrellas.   He longed to describe it all to Lueli, it seemed to him at the moment  that he could talk with the tongues of angels about umbrellas. But this was  a lesson in mathematics: applied mathematics, moreover, a compromise,  so that all further compromises must be sternly nipped. Unbending to no  red herrings he replied:   "An umbrella, Lueli, when in use resembles the the shell that would  be formed by rotating an arc of curve about its axis of symmetry, attached  to a cylinder of small radius whose axis is the same as the axis of sym  metry of the generating curve of the shell. When not in use it is properly  an elongated cone, but it is more usually helicoidal in form."   Lueli made no answer. He lay down again, this time face downward.   Mr. Fortune continued: "An umbrella, however, is not essential. A stick  will do just as well, so find me one, and we will go on to the actual  measurement."   Lueli was very slow in finding a stick. He looked for it rather languidly  and stupidly, but Mr. Fortune tried to hope that this was because his  mind was engaged on what he had just learnt.   Holding the stick between his feet, Mr. Fortune wriggled about on his  back trying to get into the proper position. He knew he was making a  fool of himself. The young men in Finsbury Park had never wriggled  about on their backs. Obviously there must be some more dignified way of     2260 Sylvia Townsend Warner   getting the top of the stick in line with the top of the tree and his eye,  but just then it was not obvious to him. Lueli made it worse by standing  about and looking miserably on. When he had placed himself properly he  remembered that he had not measured the stick. It measured (he had had  the forethought to bring the tape with him) three foot seven, very tire  some: those odd inches would only serve to make it seem harder to his  pupil. So he broke it again, drove it into the ground, and wriggled on his  stomach till his eye was in the right place, which was a slight improvement  in method, at any rate. He then handed the tape to Lueli, and lay strictly  motionless, admonishing and directing while Lueli did the measuring of  the ground. In the interests of accuracy he did it thrice, each time with a  different result. A few minutes before noon the height of the tree was  discovered to be fifty-seven foot, nine inches.   Mr. Fortune now had leisure for compassion. He thought Lueli was  looking hot and fagged, so he said:   "Why don't you have a bathe? It will freshen you up."   Lueli raised his head and looked at him with a long dubious look, as  though he had heard the words but without understanding what they  meant. Then he turned his eyes to the tree and looked at that. A sort of  shadowy wrinkle, like the blurring on the surface of milk before it boils,  crossed his face.   "Don't worry any more about that tree. If you hate all this so much  we won't do any more of it, I will never speak of geometry again. Put it  all out of your head and go and bathe."     COMMENTARY ON   Statistics as a Literary Stimulus     YOU would not, perhaps, think statistics a subject likely to inspire the  literary imagination; yet offhand I can recall at least half a dozen  fables based on the theory of probability, among them Clerk Maxwell's  celebrated conjecture about the demon who could reverse the second law  of thermodynamics (making heat flow the wrong way) and one or two  remarkable anecdotes by Augustus de Morgan. Charles Dickens issued an  interesting tribute to theoretical statistics by refusing, one day late in  December, to travel by train, on the ground that the average annual quota  of railroad accidents in Britain had not been filled and therefore further  disasters were obviously imminent.   All of us, I suppose, are a little afraid of statistics. Like Atropos, the  sister who cut the thread, they are inexorable; like her too, they are not  only impersonal but terribly personal. One dreams of flouting them. A  modern Prometheus would not waste his time showing up the gods by  stuffing a sacrificial bull with bones; he would flaunt his artfulness and  independence by juggling the law of large numbers. Neither heaven nor  earth could be straightened out thereafter. That bit of mischief is essen  tially what the next two fables are about.   Inflexible Logic by Russell Maloney is a widely known and admired  story built around a famous statistical whimsy. Eddington gave currency  to it in one of his lectures but I am far from certain that he made it up.  Maloney was a writer of short stories, sketches, profiles, anecdotes, many  of which appeared in The New Yorker magazine between the years 1934  and 1950. He conducted for several years the magazine's popular depart  ment, "Talk of the Town," and claimed to have written for it "something  like 2600 perfect anecdotes." He died in New York, September 5, 1948,  at the age of thirty-eight.   The Law is a fascinating, and, in a way, terrifying story of a sudden,  mysterious failure of the "law of averages." To be sure there is no such  law, but when it fails the consequences are much worse than if death had  taken a holiday. If men cannot be depended on to behave like a herd or  like the molecules of a gas the entire social order falls to ruin. Robert  Coates, the author of this and other equally entrancing tales, is a writer  and art critic. He too contributes frequently to The New Yorker. His  books include Wisteria Cottage (1948), The Bitter Season (1946), The  Outlaw Years (1930), The Eater of Darkness (1929).     2261     How often might a man, after he had fumbled a set of letters in a bag,  fling them out upon the ground before they would fall into an exact poem,  yea, or so much as make a good discourse in prose. And may not a little  book be as easily made by chance as this great volume of the world.   ARCHBISHOP TILLOTSON     4 Inflexible Logic   By RUSSELL MALONEY     WHEN the six chimpanzees came into his life, Mr. Bainbridge was thirty-  eight years old. He was a bachelor and lived comfortably in a remote part  of Connecticut, in a large old house with a carnage drive, a conservatory,  a tennis court, and a well-selected library. His income was derived from  impeccably situated real estate in New York City, and he spent it soberly,  in a manner which could give offence to nobody. Once a year, late in  April, his tennis court was resurfaced, and after that anybody in the  neighborhood was welcome to use it; his monthly statement from Bren-  tano's seldom ran below seventy-five dollars; every third year, in Novem  ber, he turned in his old Cadillac coupe for a new one; he ordered his  cigars, which were mild and rather moderately priced, in shipments of one  thousand, from a tobacconist in Havana; because of the international situ  ation he had cancelled arrangements to travel abroad, and after due  thought had decided to spend his travelling allowance on wines, which  seemed likely to get scarcer and more expensive if the war lasted. On the  whole, Mr. Bainbridge's life was deliberately, and not too unsuccessfully,  modelled after that of an English country gentleman of the late eighteenth  century, a gentleman interested in the arts and in the expansion of science,  and so sure of himself that he didn't care if some people thought him  eccentric.   Mr. Bainbridge had many friends in New York, and he spent several  days of the month in the city, staying at his club and looking around.  Sometimes he called up a girl and took her out to a theatre and a night  club. Sometimes he and a couple of classmates got a little tight and went  to a prizefight. Mr. Bainbridge also looked in now and then at some of  the conservative art galleries, and liked occasionally to go to a concert.  And he liked cocktail parties, too, because of the fine footling conversa  tion and the extraordinary number of pretty girls who had nothing else  to do with the rest of their evening. It was at a New York cocktail party,  however, that Mr. Bainbridge kept his preliminary appointment with  doom. At one of the parties given by Hobie Packard, the stockbroker, he  learned about the theory of the six chimpanzees.     2262     Inflexible Logic &&   It was almost six-forty. The people who had intended to have one drink  and go had already gone, and the people who intended to stay were  fortifying themselves with slightly dried canapes and talking animatedly.  A group of stage and radio people had coagulated in one corner, near  Packard's Capehart, and were wrangling about various methods of cheat  ing the Collector of Internal Revenue. In another corner was a group of  stockbrokers, talking about the greatest stockbroker of them all, Gauguin.  Little Marcia Lupton was sitting with a young man, saying earnestly, "Do  you really want to know what my greatest ambition is? I want to be my  self," and Mr. Bainbridge smiled gently, thinking of the time Marcia had  said that to him. Then he heard the voice of Bernard Weiss, the critic,  saying, "Of course he wrote one good novel. It's not surprising. After all,  we know that if six chimpanzees were set to work pounding six type  writers at random, they would, in a million years, write all the books in  the British Museum."   Mr. Bainbridge drifted over to Weiss and was introduced to Weiss's  companion, a Mr. Noble. "What's this about a million chimpanzees,  Weiss?" he asked.   "Six chimpanzees," Mr. Weiss said. "It's an old cliche of the mathe  maticians. I thought everybody was told about it in school. Law of aver  ages, you know, or maybe it's permutation and combination. The six  chimps, just pounding away at the typewriter keys, would be bound to  copy out all the books ever written by man. There are only so many  possible combinations of letters and numerals, and they'd produce all of  them see? Of course they'd also turn out a mountain of gibberish, but  they'd work the books in, too. All the books in the British Museum."   Mr. Bainbridge was delighted; this was the sort of talk he liked to hear  when he came to New York. "Well, but look here," he said, just to keep  up his part in the foolish conversation, "what if one of the chimpanzees  finally did duplicate a book, right down to the last period, but left that  off? Would that count?"   "I suppose not. Probably the chimpanzee would get around to doing  the book again, and put the period in."   "What nonsense!" Mr. Noble cried.   "It may be nonsense, but Sir James Jeans believes it," Mr. Weiss said,  huffily. "Jeans or Lancelot Hogben. I know I ran across it quite recently."   Mr. Bainbridge was impressed. He read quite a bit of popular science,  and both Jeans and Hogben were in his library. "Is that so?" he mur  mured, no longer feeling frivolous. "Wonder if it has ever actually been  tried? I mean, has anybody ever put six chimpanzees in a room with six  typewriters and a lot of paper?"   Mr. Weiss glanced at Mr. Bainbridge's empty cocktail glass and said  drily, "Probably not."     Russell Maloney     Nine weeks later, on a winter evening, Mr. Bainbridge was sitting in his  study with his friend James Mallard, an assistant professor of mathematics  at New Haven. He was plainly nervous as he poured himself a drink and  said, "Mallard, I've asked you to come here Brandy? Cigar? for a  particular reason. You remember that I wrote you some time ago, asking  your opinion of ... of a certain mathematical hypothesis or supposi   tion."   "Yes," Professor Mallard said, briskly. "I remember perfectly. About  the six chimpanzees and the British Museum. And I told you it was a  perfectly sound popularization of a principle known to every schoolboy  who had studied the science of probabilities."   "Precisely," Mr. Bainbridge said, "Well, Mallard, I made up my mind.  ... It was not difficult for me, because I have, in spite of that fellow in  the White House, been able to give something every year to the Museum  of Natural History, and they were naturally glad to oblige me. . . . And  after all, the only contribution a layman can make to the progress of  science is to assist with the drudgery of experiment. ... In short, I "   "I suppose you're trying to tell me that you have procured six chimpan  zees and set them to work at typewriters in order to see whether they will  eventually write all the books in the British Museum. Is that it?"   "Yes, that's it," Mr. Bainbridge said. "What a mind you have, Mallard.  Six fine young males, in perfect condition. I had a I suppose you'd call  it a dormitory built out in back of the stable. The typewriters are in the  conservatory. It's light and airy in there, and I moved most of the plants  out. Mr. North, the man who owns the circus, very obligingly let me  engage one of his best animal men. Really, it was no trouble at all."   Professor Mallard smiled indulgently. "After all, such a thing is not  unheard of," he said. "I seem to remember that a man at some university  put his graduate students to work flipping coins, to see if heads and tails  came up an equal number of times. Of course they did."   Mr. Bainbridge looked at his friend very queerly. "Then you believe  that any such principle of the science of probabilities will stand up under  an actual test?"  "Certainly."   "You had better see for yourself." Mr. Bainbridge led Professor Mal  lard downstairs, along a corridor, through a disused music room, and into  a large conservatory. The middle of the floor had been cleared of plants  and was occupied by a row of six typewriter tables, each one supporting a  hooded machine. At the left of each typewriter was a neat stack of yellow  copy paper. Empty wastebaskets were under each table. The chairs were  the unpadded, spring-backed kind favored by experienced stenographers.  A large bunch of ripe bananas was hanging in one corner, and in another  stood a Great Bear water-cooler and a rack of Lily cups. Six piles of     Inflexible Logic 2265   typescript, each about a foot high, were ranged along the wall on an  improvised shelf. Mr. Bainbridge picked up one of the piles, which he  could just conveniently lift, and set it on a table before Professor Mallard.  "The output to date of Chimpanzee A, known as Bill,' 1 he said simply.   " * "Oliver Twist," by Charles Dickens,' " Professor Mallard read out.  He read the first and second pages of the manuscript, then feverishly  leafed through to the end. "You mean to tell me," he said, "that this  chimpanzee has written "   "Word for word and comma for comma," said Mr. Bainbridge. "Young,  my butler, and I took turns comparing it with the edition I own. Having  finished 'Oliver Twist,' Bill is, as you see, starting the sociological works  of Vilfredo Pareto, in Italian, At the rate he has been going, it should  keep him busy for the rest of the month/'   "And all the chimpanzees" Professor Mallard was pale, and enun  ciated with -difficulty "they aren't all "   "Oh, yes, all writing books which I have every reason to believe are in  the British Museum. The prose of John Donne, some Anatole France,  Conan Doyle, Galen, the collected plays of Somerset Maugham, Marcel  Proust, the memoirs of the late Marie of Rumania, and a monograph by  a Dr. Wiley on the marsh grasses of Maine and Massachusetts. I can sum  it up for you, Mallard, by telling you that since I started this experiment,  four weeks and some days ago, none of the chimpanzees has spoiled a  single sheet of paper."   Professor Mallard straightened up, passed his handkerchief across his  brow, and took a deep breath. tk l apologize for my weakness," he said.  "It was simply the sudden shock. No, looking at the thing scientifically  and I hope I am at least as capable of that as the next man there is  nothing marvellous about the situation. These chimpanzees, or a succes  sion of similar teams of chimpanzees, would in a million years write all  the books in the British Museum. I told you some time ago that I believed  that statement. Why should my belief be altered by the fact that they  produced some of the books at the very outset? After all, I should not be  very much surprised if I tossed a coin a hundred times and It came up  heads every time. I know that if I kept at it long enough, the ratio would  reduce itself to an exact fifty per cent. Rest assured, these chimpanzees  will begin to compose gibberish quite soon. It is bound to happen. Science  tells us so. Meanwhile, I advise you to keep this experiment secret.  Uninformed people might create a sensation if they knew."   "I will, indeed," Mr. Bainbridge said. "And I'm very grateful for your  rational analysis. It reassures me. And now, before you go, you must hear  the new Schnabel records that arrived today."   During the succeeding three months, Professor Mallard got into the  habit of telephoning Mr. Bainbridge every Friday afternoon at five-thirty,     Russell Maloney  226o   immediately after leaving his seminar room. The Professor would say,  "Well?," and Mr. Bainbridge would reply, "They're still at it, Mallard.  Haven't spoiled a sheet of paper yet." If Mr. Bainbridge had to go out  on Friday afternoon, he would leave a written message with his butler,  who would read it to Professor Mallard: u Mr. Bainbridge says we now  have Trevelyan's 'Life of Macauiay,' the Confessions of St. Augustine,  'Vanity Fair/ part of Irving's 'Life of George Washington,' the Book of  the Dead, and some speeches delivered in Parliament in opposition to the  Corn Laws, sir." Professor Mallard would reply, with a hint of a snarl  in his voice, "Tell him to remember what I predicted," and hang up with   a clash.   The eleventh Friday that Professor Mallard telephoned, Mr. Bainbridge  said, "No change. I have had to store the bulk of the manuscript in the  cellar. I would have burned it, except that it probably has some scientific  value."   "How dare you talk of scientific value?" The voice from New Haven  roared faintly in the receiver. "Scientific value! You you chimpanzee!"  There were further inarticulate sputterings, and Mr. Bainbridge hung up  with a disturbed expression. "I am afraid Mallard is overtaxing himself,"  he murmured.   Next day, however, he was pleasantly surprised. He was leafing through  a manuscript that had been completed the previous day by Chimpanzee D,  Corky. It was the complete diary of Samuel Pepys, and Mr. Bainbridge  was chuckling over the naughty passages, which were omitted in his own  edition, when Professor Mallard was shown into the room. "I have come  to apologize for my outrageous conduct on the telephone yesterday," the  Professor said.   "Please don't think of it any more. I know you have many things on  your mind," Mr. Bainbridge said. "Would you like a drink?"   "A large whiskey, straight, please," Professor Mallard said. "I got  rather cold driving down. No change, I presume?"   "No, none. Chimpanzee F, Dinty, is just finishing John Florio's trans  lation of Montaigne's essays, but there is no other news of interest."   Professor Mallard squared his shoulders and tossed off his drink in one  astonishing gulp. "I should like to see them at work," he said. "Would I  disturb them, do you think?"   "Not at all. As a matter of fact, I usually look in on them around this  time of day. Dinty may have finished his Montaigne by now, and it is  always interesting to see them start a new work. I would have thought  that they would continue on the same sheet of paper, but they don't, you  know. Always a fresh sheet, and the title in capitals."   Professor Mallard, without apology, poured another drink and slugged  it down. "Lead on," he said.     Inflexible Logic 2267   It was dusk in the conservatory, and the chimpanzees were typing by  the light of student lamps clamped to their desks. The keeper lounged in  a corner, eating a banana and reading Billboard. "You might as well take  an hour or so off," Mr. Bainbridge said. The man left.   Professor Mallard, who had not taken off his overcoat, stood with his  hands in his pockets, looking at the busy chimpanzees. "I wonder if you  know, Bainbridge, that the science of probabilities takes everything into  account," he said, in a queer, tight voice. "It is certainly almost beyond  the bounds of credibility that these chimpanzees should write books with  out a single error, but that abnormality may be corrected by thesel"  He took his hands from his pockets, and each one held a .38 revolver.  "Stand back out of harm's way!" he shouted.   "Mallard! Stop it!" The revolvers barked, first the right hand, then the  left, then the right. Two chimpanzees fell, and a third reeled into a  corner. Mr. Bainbridge seized his friend's arm and wrested one of the  weapons from him.   "Now I am armed, too, Mallard, and I advise you to stop!" he cried.  Professor Mallard's answer was to draw a bead on Chimpanzee E and  shoot him dead. Mr. Bainbridge made a rush, and Professor Mallard fired  at him. Mr. Bainbridge, in his quick death agony, tightened his finger on  the trigger of his revolver. It went off, and Professor Mallard went down.  On his hands and knees he fired at the two chimpanzees which were still  unhurt, and then collapsed.   There was nobody to hear his last words. "The human equation . . .  always the enemy of science . . ." he panted. "This time . . . vice versa  ... I, a mere mortal . . . savior of science . . . deserve a Nobel . . ."   When the old butler came running into the conservatory to investigate  the noises, his eyes were met by a truly appalling sight. The student lamps  were shattered, but a newly risen moon shone in through the conservatory  windows on the corpses of the two gentlemen, each clutching a smoking  revolver. Five of the chimpanzees were dead. The sixth was Chimpanzee  F. His right arm disabled, obviously bleeding to death, he was slumped  before his typewriter. Painfully, with his left hand, he took from the  machine the completed last page of Florio's Montaigne. Groping for a  fresh sheet, he inserted it, and typed with one finger, "UNCLE TOM'S CABIN,  by Harriet Beecher Stowe. Chapte . . ." Then he, too, was dead.

COATES     THE first intimation that things were getting out of hand came one early-  fall evening in the late nineteen-forties. What happened, simply, was that  between seven and nine o'clock on that evening the Triborough Bridge  had the heaviest concentration of outbound traffic in its entire history.   This was odd, for it was a weekday evening (to be precise, a Wednes  day), and though the weather was agreeably mild and clear, with a moon  that was close enough to being full to lure a certain number of motorists  out of the city, these facts alone were not enough to explain the phenom  enon. No other bridge or main highway was affected, and though the two  preceding nights had been equally balmy and moonlit, on both of these  the bridge traffic had run close to normal.   The bridge personnel, at any rate, was caught entirely unprepared. A  main artery of traffic, like the Triborough, operates under fairly predict  able conditions. Motor travel, like most other large-scale human activities,  obeys the Law of Averages that great, ancient rule that states that the  actions of people in the mass will always follow consistent patterns and  on the basis of past experience it had always been possible to foretell,  almost to the last digit, the number of cars that would cross the bridge at  any given hour of the day or night. In this case, though, all rules were  broken.   The hours from seven till nearly midnight are normally quiet ones on  the bridge. But on that night it was as if all the motorists in the city, or  at any rate a staggering proportion of them, had conspired together to  upset tradition. Beginning almost exactly at seven o'clock, cars poured  onto the bridge in such numbers and with such rapidity that the staff at  the toll booths was overwhelmed almost from the start. It was soon     The Law 2269   apparent that this was no momentary congestion, and as it became more  and more obvious that the traffic jam promised to be one of truly monu  mental proportions, added details of police were rushed to the scene to  help handle it.   Cars streamed in from all directions from the Bronx approach and  the Manhattan one, from 125th Street and the East River Drive. (At the  peak of the crush, about eight-fifteen, observers on the bridge reported  that the drive was a solid line of car headlights as far south as the bend  at Eighty-ninth Street, while the congestion crosstown in Manhattan dis  rupted traffic as far west as Amsterdam Avenue.) And perhaps the most  confusing thing about the whole manifestation was that there seemed to  be no reason for it.   Now and then, as the harried toll-booth attendants made change for  the seemingly endless stream of cars, they would question the occupants,  and it soon became clear that the very participants in the monstrous tieup  were as ignorant of its cause as anyone else was. A report made by  Sergeant Alfonse OToole, who commanded the detail in charge of the  Bronx approach, is typical. "I kept askin' them," he said, " 'Is there night  football somewhere that we don't know about? Is it the races you're goin*  to?' But the funny thing was half the time they'd be askin' me. What's  the crowd for, Mac?' they would say. And I'd just look at them. There  was one guy I mind, in a Ford convertible with a girl in the seat beside  him, and when he asked me, I said to him, 'Hell, you're in the crowd,  ain't you?' I said. What brings you here?' And the dummy just looked at  me. 'Me?' he says. *I just come out for a drive in the moonlight. But if  I'd known there'd be a crowd like this . . .' he says. And then he asks  me, 'Is there any place I can turn around and get out of this?* " As the  Herald Tribune summed things up in its story next morning, it "just  looked as if everybody in Manhattan who owned a motorcar had decided  to drive out on Long Island that evening."   The incident was unusual enough to make all the front pages next  morning, and because of this, many similar events, which might otherwise  have gone unnoticed, received attention. The proprietor of the Aramis  Theatre, on Eighth Avenue, reported that on several nights in the recent  past his auditorium had been practically empty, while on others it had  been jammed to suffocation. Luncheon owners noted that increasingly  their patrons were developing a habit of making runs on specific items;  one day it would be the roast shoulder of veal with pan gravy that was  ordered almost exclusively, while the next everyone would be taking the  Vienna loaf, and the roast veal went begging. A man who ran a small  notions store in Bayside revealed that over a period of four days two  hundred and seventy-four successive customers had entered his shop and  asked for a spool of pink thread.     Robert M. Coates   These were news items that would ordinarily have gone into the papers  as fillers or in the sections reserved for oddities. Now, however, they  seemed to have a more serious significance. It was apparent at last that  something decidedly strange was happening to people's habits, and it was  as unsettling as those occasional moments on excursion boats when the  passengers are moved, all at once, to rush to one side or the other of the  vessel. It was not till one day in December when, almost incredibly,  the Twentieth Century Limited left New York for Chicago with just three  passengers aboard that business leaders discovered how disastrous the new  trend could be, too.   Until then, the New York Central, for instance, could operate confi  dently on the assumption that although there might be several thousand  men in New York who had business relations in Chicago, on any single  day no more and no less than some hundreds of them would have  occasion to go there. The play producer could be sure that his patronage  would sort itself out and that roughly as many persons would want to see  the performance on Thursday as there had been on Tuesday or Wednes  day. Now they couldn't be sure of anything. The Law of Averages had  gone by the board, and if the effect on business promised to be cata  strophic, it was also singularly unnerving for the general customer.   The lady starting downtown for a day of shopping, for example, could  never be sure whether she would find Macy's department store a seething  mob of other shoppers or a wilderness of empty, echoing aisles and un  occupied salesgirls. And the uncertainty produced a strange sort of jitter-  iness in the individual when faced with any impulse to action. "Shall we  do it or shan't we?" people kept asking themselves, knowing that if they  did it, it might turn out that thousands of other individuals had decided  similarly; knowing, too, that if they didn't, they might miss the one glori  ous chance of all chances to have Jones Beach, say, practically to them  selves. Business languished, and a sort of desperate uncertainty rode  everyone.   At this juncture, it was inevitable that Congress should be called on for  action. In fact, Congress called on itself, and it must be said that it rose  nobly to the occasion. A committee was appointed, drawn from both  Houses and headed by Senator J. Wing Slooper (R.), of Indiana, and  though after considerable investigation the committee was forced reluc  tantly to conclude that there was no evidence of Communist instigation,  the unconscious subversiveness of the people's present conduct was obvious  at a glance. The problem was what to do about it, You can't indict a whole  nation, particularly on such vague grounds as these were. But, as Senator  Slooper boldly pointed out, "You can control it," and in the end a system  of reeducation and reform was decided upon, designed to lead people     The Law 2271   back to again we quote Senator Slooper "the basic regularities, the  homely averageness of the American way of life."   In the course of the committee's investigations, it had been discovered,  to everyone's dismay, that the Law of Averages had never been incor  porated into the body of federal jurisprudence, and though the upholders  of States' Rights rebelled violently, the oversight was at once corrected,  both by Constitutional amendment and by a law the Hills-Slooper Act  implementing it. According to the Act, people were required to be aver  age, and, as the simplest way of assuring it, they were divided alphabeti  cally and their permissible activities catalogued accordingly. Thus, by the  plan, a person whose name began with "G," "N," or "U," for example,  could attend the theatre only on Tuesdays, and he could go to baseball  games only on Thursdays, whereas his visits to a haberdashery were  confined to the hours between ten o'clock and noon on Mondays.   The law, of course, had its disadvantages. It had a crippling effect on  theatre parties, among other social functions, and the cost of enforcing it  was unbelievably heavy. In the end, too, so many amendments had to be  added to it such as the one permitting gentlemen to take their fiancees  (if accredited) along with them to various events and functions no matter  what letter the said fiancees' names began with that the courts were  frequently at a loss to interpret it when confronted with violations.   In its way, though, the law did serve its purpose, for it did induce  rather mechanically, it is true, but still adequately a return to that aver  age existence that Senator Slooper desired. All, indeed, would have been  well if a year or so later disquieting reports had not begun to seep in from  the backwoods. It seemed that there, in what had hitherto been considered  to be marginal areas, a strange wave of prosperity was making itself felt.  Tennessee mountaineers were buying Packard convertibles, and Sears,  Roebuck reported that in the Ozarks their sales of luxury items had gone  up nine hundred per cent. In the scrub sections of Vermont, men who  formerly had barely been able to scratch a living from their rock-strewn  acres were now sending their daughters to Europe and ordering expensive  cigars from New York. It appeared that the Law of Diminishing Returns  was going haywire, too.     PART XXIV   Mathematics and Music   1. Mathematics of Music by SIR JAMES JEANS     COMMENTARY ON   SIR JAMES JEANS   CUR JAMES JEANS was a mathematical physicist whose writings were  b much admired by Talluiah Bankhead. I do not know that Miss Bank-  head was especially moved by Jeans' contributions to the theory of gases  or to the study of the equilibrium of rotating fluid masses, but it is re  corded that she described the best known of his works, The Mysterious  Universe, as a book every girl should read. 1   Jeans had a productive and varied career which divides more or less  into two periods. He was born in 1877 in Ormskirk, Lancashire, to parents  in comfortable circumstances. His father was a journalist attached to the  press gallery of the House of Commons but with interests a good deal  broader than the chicaneries and trivia of daily politics. He published  two popular books on science,* which reflected not only his admiration  for scientific knowledge but his conviction that students of the subject  have a duty to follow the example of men like Tyndall, Huxley and  Clifford in kindling "a love of science among the masses." 3 His outlook,  a strange compound of strict Victorian religious orthodoxy and free think  ing, must have been confusing to his son. Jeans was a precocious child,  inclined to melancholy. He amused himself by memorizing seven-place  logarithms and by dissecting and studying the mechanism of clocks; he  was also trained at an early age to read the first leader of the Times each  morning to his parents. One of his biographers, J. G. Crowther, remarks  that "there are cases of the balance of infants' minds having been dis  turbed by this practice." 4   At nineteen Jeans entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read  mathematics and soon gave evidence of exceptional powers. One envies  him his undergraduate days in a college whose faculty included J. W. L.  Glaisher, W. W. Rouse Ball, Alfred North Whitehead and Edmund  T. Whittaker. He finished second in the stiff competitive examination  known as the tripos, two places above his classmate G. H. Hardy,  who later became the foremost British mathematician of his genera  tion.   Jeans first applied his imagination and formidable mathematical tech  nique to problems concerned with the distribution of energy among the  molecules in a gas. Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann had invented  theories which treated gas molecules as if they were tiny billiard balls   1 J. G. Crowther, British Scientists of (he Twentieth Century, London, 1952, p. 95,   2 The Creators of the Age of Steel (1884); Lives of the Electricians (1887),   3 Crowther, op. cit., p. 96.   4 Crowther, op, cit,, p. 97.     2274     Sir James Jeans 2275   "rigid and geometrically perfect spheres." While these theories fitted the  observed facts fairly well, they produced serious dilemmas connected with  the law of the conservation of energy and the second law of thermo  dynamics. In Jeans' first treatise, Dynamical Theory of Gases (1904), he  refined the older theories and overcame some of the principal difficulties  to which they gave rise.   What is generally regarded as Jeans' masterwork, his Problems of  Cosmogony and Stellar Dynamics (1917), also has to do with the be  havior of gases. This book discusses the cosmogonic problems involving  "incompressible masses acted on by their own gravitation." 5 What hap  pens to a mass of liquid "spinning about an axis and isolated in space"?  What are the changes of form assumed by masses of gas (like the sun)  under rotation, and as the masses shrink? What is the bearing of these  matters on the evolution of planets and of our solar system? Questions of  this kind had attracted the greatest scientists from Newton and Laplace  to Poincare and Sir George Darwin. Jeans' treatise, while claiming no  finality for its conclusions, is acknowledged to be a landmark in the  history of astronomy, a contribution to the solution of the underlying  mathematical problems which must be ranked a "permanent achievement,  come what may in the future development of cosmogony." 6   Some men turn to religion as they grow old; Jeans turned to a mixture  of religion and popular science. At the age of fifty-two, when he was  knighted, he could look back upon his research and teaching career with  unmixed satisfaction. He had been elected to a fellowship in Trinity in  1901, had served (1905-1910) as professor of applied mathematics at  Princeton, as Stokes Lecturer at Cambridge, and as one of the joint secre  taries of the Royal Society (to which he had been elected when he was  only twenty-eight) from 1919 to 1929. Marriage to a wealthy American  girl it was a very happy union had given him financial independence;  Jeans was not compelled to assume teaching duties which might interfere  with his research. By 1928 he had published seven books and seventy-six  original papers and had earned a reputation as an outstanding mathe  matician. At this point, perhaps because he felt, as Milne reports, that his  powers as a mathematician were declining, he abandoned pure science  for popularization. 7   The conversion was a tremendous success. His first book in a non  technical vein was The Universe Around Us (1929); it was followed by  The Mysterious Universe (1930) and by half a dozen similar volumes,  the last appearing in 1947. Jeans' style was "transparent, trenchant, and  dignified. His scientific narrative flowed like a grand river under complete   3 E. A. Milne, Sir James Jeans, Cambridge, 1952, p. 110.  6 E. A. Milne, op. cit., p. 114 passim.   7 Milne, op. cit., p. 73. Milne gives this on the authority of Jeans' second wife,  whom he married after the death of the first Lady Jeans in 1934.     Editor's Comment     control." 8 His images were vivid, often breathtaking. Their object was to  make the reader goggle at immensities and smallnesses, excellent items for  conversational gambits. Because he was primarily a mathematician, Jeans  expatiated less on physical ideas than on startling numerical contrasts.  The scale of matter, he noted, ranges "from electrons of a fraction of a  millionth of a millionth of an inch in diameter, to nebulae whose diam  eters are measured in hundreds of thousands of millions of miles"; a  model of the universe in which the sun was represented "by a speck of  dust 1/3400 of an inch in diameter" would have to extend four million  miles in every direction to encompass a few of our island-universe neigh  bors; "Empty Waterloo Station of everything except six specks of dust,  and it is still far more crowded with dust than space is with stars"; the  molecules in a pint of water "placed end to end . . . would form a chain  capable of encircling the earth over 200 million times"; the energy in a  thimble of water would drive a large vessel back and forth across the  ocean twenty times; a pinhead heated to a temperature equal to that at  the center of the sun would "emit enough heat to kill anyone who ven  tured within a thousand miles of it"; the sun loses daily by radiation  360,000 million tons of its weight, the earth only ninety pounds. Most of  us were brought up on these images and have never shaken off their  emotional impact, though it is true that the facts of the atomic age make  some of Jeans' best flesh-creepers sound commonplace.   The public took Jeans' excitements to its heart, but scientists and philos  ophers were able to restrain their enthusiasm. As, more and more, a reli  gious, emotional and mystical note crept into his books, they came under  sharp attack. In her biting Philosophy and the Physicists, Susan Stebbing  let fly at both Jeans and Eddington for their philosophical interpretation  of physical theories. 9 "Both of these writers approach their task through  an emotional fog; they present their views with an amount of personifi  cation and metaphor that reduces them to the level of revivalist preach  ers." Many of Jeans' "devices," wrote Miss Stebbing, "are used appar  ently for no other purpose than to reduce the reader to a state of abject  terror." Other critics were kinder (and less witty) but raised essentially  the same objections. It is hard to escape the feeling that Jeans capitalized  increasingly on his charm and virtuosity as a popular expositor, that he  yielded to an inner need to write more even as his ideas were petering  out. 10  Jeans died of a heart attack on September 16, 1946. He was reading   8 Crov, ther, op. cit., p. 93.   Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, 1944; Chapters 1-3 passim.   10 "The Mysterious Urmerse received fierce criticism when it was published.  Rutherford was heard to say that Jeans had told him that 'that fellow Eddington has  written a book which has sold 50,000 copies; I will write one that will sell 100,000.'  And Rutherford added: *He did.' " Crowther, op. cit., p. 136.     Sir James Jeans 2277   proofs of his last book, The Growth of Physical Science, only a few days  before his death.   In this biographical sketch, brief though it is, I have said a good deal  more about Jeans' work as a popularizer than as an original investigator.  This seemed desirable because of his real contribution, now disparaged,  to scientific education. He was a first-rate mathematical physicist and  for that he will be remembered. It would be unjust, however, to over  look the impetus he gave to scientific understanding in much broader  circles, even though some of his ideas were muddled and grossly mis  leading; even though, in later years, he came close to being a hack. On  the whole, I think more persons got a glimpse of the meaning of science,  a taste of its excitement, integrity and beauty from Jeans' vivid primers  than were led astray by his misty philosophy.   The selection below is from Jeans' Science and Music. This is an excel  lent account of the science of sound, written in a lucid and straightforward  style, without theological dissonances; it is expert in discussions of both  the experimental and mathematical sides of the subject. I have chosen  excerpts which illustrate the remarkable contribution that mathematicians  have made to the analysis of musical structure, from the profound discov  ery made by Pythagoras through the magnificent labors of Helmholtz and  his successors. Jeans deeply loved music all his life; he often played the  organ for three or four hours a day, and thought in musical images even  in his scientific work. 11 His second wife was a brilliant organist and their  mutual interest in music led to the writing of this book.   11 Crowther, op. cit., p. 93.     Discoursed with Mr. Hooke about the nature of sounds, and he did make  me understand the nature of musicall sounds made by strings, mighty  prettily; and he told me that having come to a certain number of vibrations  proper to make any tone, he is able to tell ho* many strokes a fly makes  with her wings (those flies that hum in their flying) by the^ note that it  answers to in musique, during their flying.

ALFRED NORTH WHITEHEAD     1 Mathematics of Music   By SIR JAMES JEANS   TUNING-FORKS AND PURE TONES   WE have seen that every sound, and every succession of sounds, can be  represented by a curve, and our first problem must obviously be to find  the relation between such a curve and the sound or sequence of sounds it  represents in brief, we must learn to interpret a sound-curve.   PURE TONES   Let us start by taking an ordinary tuning-fork as our source of sound.  We begin with this rather than, let us say, a violin or an organ-pipe,  because it gives a perfectly pure musical note, as we shall shortly see. If  we strike its prongs on something hard, or draw a violin-bow across them,  they are set into vibration. We can see that they are in vibration from  their fuzzy outline. Or we can feel that they are in vibration by touching  them with our fingers, when we shall experience a trembling or a buzzing  sensation. Or, without trusting our senses at all, we may gently touch one  prong with a light pith ball suspended from a thread, and shall find that  the ball is knocked away with some violence.   When the prongs of the fork vibrate, they communicate their vibrations  to the air surrounding them, and this in turn transmits the agitation to  our ear-drums, with the result that we hear a sound. We can verify that  the air is necessary to the hearing of the sound by standing the vibrating  fork inside an air-pump and extracting the air. The fuzzy appearance of  the prongs shews that the fork is still in vibration, but we can no longer  hear the sound, because the air no longer provides a path by which the  vibrations can travel to our ears.     2278     Mathematics of Music     2279      FIGURE 1 The vibrations of a tuning-fork give a fuzzy appearance to the prongs aod cause them  to repel a light pith ball with some violence.      FIGURE 2 The trace of a vibrating fork can be obtained by drawing a piece of paper or smoked  glass under it.   To study these vibrations in detail, we may attach a stiff bristle or a  light gramophone needle to the end of one prong of the fork, and while  the fork is in vibration, run a piece of smoked glass under it as shewn in  Figure 2, taking care that it moves in a perfectly straight line and at a  perfectly steady speed. If the fork were not vibrating, the point of the  needle would naturally cut a straight furrow through the smoky deposit  on the glass; if we held the glass up to the light, it would look like Figure  3. In actual fact, we shall find it looks like Figure 4, which is a copy of  an actual photograph; the vibrations have left their record in the smoke,  so that the needle has not cut a straight but a wavy furrow. Each complete  wave obviously corresponds to a single to-and-fro motion of the needle  point, and so to a complete vibration of the prong of the tuning-fork.     2280     Sir James Jeans      FIGURE 3 The trace of a non-vibrating fork.      FIGURE 4 Tfae trace of a vibrating fork. The waves are produced by the vibrations of the fork,   one complete wave by one complete vibration.   This wavy curve must clearly be the sound-curve of the sound emitted  by the vibrating fork. For if we reverse the motion and compel the  needle to follow the furrow, the sideways motions of the needle will set  up similar motions in the prong to which it is attached, and these will  produce exactly the same sound as was produced when the fork vibrated  freely of itself. In fact, the whole process is like that of listening to a  gramophone record, except that the tuning-fork, instead of a mica dia  phragm, transmits the sound-vibrations to the air.   This simple experiment has disclosed the relation between the musical  sound produced by a tuning-fork and its curve, which we now find to  consist of a succession of similar waves.   The extreme regularity of these waves is striking; they are all of pre  cisely the same shape, so that their lengths are all exactly the same, and  they recur at perfectly regular intervals. Indeed, it is this regularity which  distinguishes music from mere noise. So long as a gramophone needle is  moving regularly to-and-fro in its groove we hear music; the moment  it comes upon an accidental scratch on the record, so that its motion  experiences a sudden irregular jerk, we hear mere noise. In such ways as  this, we discover that regularity is the essential of a musical sound-curve.     Mathematics oi Music 2281   Yet the regularity can be overdone, and absolute unending regularity  produces mere unpleasing monotony. The problem of designing a curve  which shall give pleasure to the ear is not altogether unlike that of design  ing a building which shall give pleasure to the eye. A mere collection of  random oddments thrown together anyhow is not satisfying; our aesthetic  sense calls for a certain amount of regularity, rhythm and balance. Yet  these qualities carried to excess produce monotony and lifelessness the  barracks in architecture and the dull flat hum of the tuning-fork in music.     PERIOD, FREQUENCY AND PITCH   When a tuning-fork is first set into vibration, we hear a fairly loud note,  but this gradually weakens in intensity as the vibrations transfer their  energy to the surrounding air. Unless the fork was struck very violently in  the first instance, we notice that the pitch of this note remains the same  throughout; if the fork sounded middle C when it was first struck, it will  continue to sound this same note until its sound dies away into silence. 1  On taking a trace of the whole motion, in the manner shewn in Figure 2,  we find that the waves slowly decrease in height as the sound diminishes  in strength, but they remain always of the same length.   If we measure the speed at which the fork is drawn over the smoked  glass in taking this trace, we can easily calculate the amount of time the  needle takes to make each wave. This is, of course, the time of a single  vibration of the fork, and is only a minute fraction of a second; we call  it the "period" of the vibration. The number of complete vibrations which  occur in a second is called the "frequency" of the vibration. Actual experi  ment shews that a tuning-fork which is tuned to middle C of the piano  forte executes 261 vibrations in a second, regardless of whether the sound  is loud or soft.   This frequency of 261 is associated with the pitch of middle C not only  for the sound of a tuning-fork, but also for all musical sounds, no matter  how they are produced. For instance, a siren which runs at such a rate  that 261 blasts of air escape in a second will sound middle C. Or we may  hold the edge of a card against a rotating toothed wheel; if 261 teeth  strike the card every second we again hear middle C. If a steam-saw runs  at such a rate that 261 teeth cut into the wood every second, it is again  middle C that we hear. The hum of a dynamo is middle C when the  current alternates at the rate of 261 cycles a second, and this is true of  all electric machinery. There are electric organs on the market in which  the sound of a middle C pipe is copied, sometimes very faithfully, by an   1 If the fork was struck very violently in the first Instance, there may be a very  slight sharpening of pitch as the vibrations become of more usual intensity.     electric current which is made to alternate at the rate of 261 cycles a  second. Again, when a motor-car is running at such a rate that the pistons  make 261 strokes a second, a vibration of frequency 261 is set up, and  we hear a note of pitch middle C in the noise of the engine.   All this shews that the pitch of a sound depends only on the fre  quency of the vibration by which it is produced. It does not depend on  the nature of the vibration. Thus we may say that it is the frequency of  vibration that determines the pitch of a sound. If there is no clearly  defined frequency, there is no clearly defined pitch, because the sound is  no longer musical.   When a siren or steam-saw or dynamo is increasing its speed, the sound  we hear rises in pitch, and conversely. Thus we learn to associate high  pitch with high frequency, and vice versa. If we experiment with a series  of forks tuned to all the notes in the middle octave of the piano, we shall  find the following frequencies:     c 261-0  c# 276-5  d 293-0  d# 310-4  e 328-8    f 348-4  f# 369-1  g 391-1  g# 414-3    a 438-9  a# 465-0  b 492-7  c' 522-0     . . . These frequencies might at first sight be thought to be a mere  random collection of numbers, but a little study shews that they are  not.   We notice at once that the first number 261 is just half of the last  number 522. Thus our experiments have shewn that in this particular case  the interval of an octave corresponds to a 2 to 1 ratio of frequencies,  and other experiments shew that this is universally true doubling the  frequency invariably raises the pitch by an octave. The octave interval  is fundamental in the music of all ages and of all countries; we now see  its physical significance.   We may further notice that the interval from c to c# represents a rise  in frequency of just about 6 per cent., and a little arithmetic will shew  that the same is true for every other interval of a semitone. The rise can  not be precisely 6 per cent, for each semitone, since if it were, the rise in  the whole octave, consisting of twelve such intervals, would be equal to  1 -06 X 1 -06 X 1 -06 X ... etc., there being twelve factors in all, each  equal to 1 06. This is the quantity which the mathematician describes  as (1 -06) 12 , and it is equal to 2-0122, and not to exactly 2.   In an instrument such as the piano or organ, which is tuned to "equal  temperament" the exact interval of 2 is spread equally over the twelve  semitone intervals which make the octave. Each step accordingly repre  sents a frequency ratio of 1 * 05946, since this is the exact twelfth root  of 2. ...     Mathematics of Music 2283   SIMPLE HARMONIC CURVES   Having learned all we can from the regularity and length of the waves  in Figure 4, let us next examine their form. The extreme simplicity of  their shape is very noticeable, although it must be said at once that this  is not a property of all sound-curves; these particular curves are simple  because they are produced by the simplest of all musical instruments  the tuning-fork. Exact measurement shews that the curve has a shape with  which the mathematician is very well acquainted. It is called a "sine"  curve, or a "simple harmonic" curve, while the motion of the needle  which produces it is described as "simple harmonic motion."   These simple harmonic curves and the simple harmonic motion by  which they are produced are of fundamental importance in all depart  ments of mechanics and physics, as well as in many other branches of  science. They are particularly important in the theory of vibrations, and  this makes them of especial interest in the study of music, since musical  sound is almost invariably produced by the vibrations of some mechanical  structure a stretched string, a column of air, a drum-skin, or some  metallic object such as a cymbal, triangle, tube or bell. For this reason,  we shall discuss vibrations in some detail.     GENERAL THEORY OF VIBRATIONS   Generally speaking, every material structure can find at least one posi  tion in which it can remain at rest otherwise it would be a perpetual  motion machine. Such a position is called a "position of equilibrium."  When a structure is in such a position, the forces on each particle of it  as for instance the weight of the particle, and the pushes and pulls from  neighbouring particles are exactly balanced. Any slight disturbance, such  as a push, pull or knock from outside, will cause the structure to move  out of this position of equilibrium to some new position, in which the  forces on a particle are no longer evenly^ balanced; each particle then  experiences a "restoring force" which tends to pull it back to the position  it originally occupied.   This force starts by dragging the particle back towards its original  position of equilibrium. In time it regains this position, but as it is now  moving with a certain amount of speed, it overshoots the position and  travels a certain distance on the other side before coming to rest. Here  it experiences a new force tending to pull it back; again it yields to this  force, gets up speed, overshoots the mark, and so on, the motion repeat  ing itself time after time. Clearly the trace of the motion of any particle  will be a succession of waves, like those we have already obtained from  the tuning-fork in Figure 4 (p. 2280).     2284     Str James Jeans     Motion of this kind is described by the general term "oscillation." In  the special case in which each particle only moves through a very small  distance, the motion is called a "vibration." Thus a vibration is a special  kind of oscillation, and, as it happens, possesses certain very simple  properties which are not possessed by oscillations in general. It is usually  true of oscillations that the farther a particle moves from its position of  equilibrium, the greater is the restoring force pulling it back. But in a  vibration the restoring force is exactly proportional to the distance the  particle has moved from its position of equilibrium; draw it twice as far  from this position, and we double the force pulling it back.   A simple mathematical investigation shews that when this relation  holds, the motion of every particle will be of the same kind, whatever the  structure to which it belongs. Motion of this kind is defined to be "simple  harmonic motion."   We have already found a concrete instance of this kind of motion in  the tuning-fork. Another is provided by what is perhaps the simplest  mechanical structure we can imagine a weight suspended by a fine  thread. The position of equilibrium is one in which the weight lies at a      FIGURE 5 A position of equilibrium. The weight can rest in equilibrium at C but nowhere else.  If we pull jt aside to B, it tends to return to C.   point C exactly under the point of suspension. When the weight is drawn  a short distance aside to an adjacent position B, there is no longer equilib  rium, and the weight tends to fall back to C. In technical language, a  restoring force acts on the weight, tending to draw it back to its position  of equilibrium C, and it is a simple problem in dynamics to find its  amount. So long as the displacement of the weight is not too large, we  find that the restoring force is exactly proportional to the extent of the  displacement BC, so that the condition for simple harmonic motion is     Mathematics of Music 2285   fulfilled. Indeed, If we take a trace by attaching a needle to the weight  and running a piece of paper horizontally under it, as in Figure 6, we  shall find that this trace is a simple harmonic curve exactly like that made  by our tuning-fork.   If we set our suspended weight swinging more violently, and again  take a trace of its motion, we shall again obtain a simple harmonic curve.  The waves will, of course, be greater in size, but their period will be  exactly the same as before. We find that the swinging weight makes just  as many swings per second, no matter what the extent of these swings  may be, provided always that they are small enough to qualify as vibra  tions. This illustrates the well-known fact that the period of vibration of      FIGURE 6 Taking the trace of a swinging pendulum. The trace is found to be a simple harmonic  curve, exactly similar to that given by a vibrating tuning-fork (Figure 2).   a pendulum depends only on its length, and not on the extent of its swing;  it is because of this that our pendulum clocks keep time.   We found a similar property in the tuning-fork, the period of its vibra  tions being the same whether we struck it fairly hard or only very softly.  And all true vibrations possess the same property the period is inde  pendent of the extent and energy of the swing. This is a most important  fact for the musician. It means that every musical instrument in which  the sound is produced by vibrations will "keep time" like a pendulum  clock, and so will give a note of the same frequency, and therefore of the  same pitch, whether it is played soft or loud. Without this property it  may almost be said that music, as we know it, would be impossible. We  can hardly imagine an orchestra acquitting itself with credit if every note  was out of tune unless it was played with exactly the right degree of force.  Crescendos and diminuendos could only be produced by adding and sub-     22S6     Sir James Jeans     tractmg instruments. As the note of a piano or any percussion instrument  decreased in strength it would also change in pitch, and every piece would  inevitably begin with a howl and end with a wail.   At the same time, every musician is familiar with cases in which the  pitch of an instrument is changed appreciably by playing it softer or  louder. The flautist can always pull his instrument a bit out of tune by  blowing strong or weak, while the organist knows only too well the dismal  wail of flattened notes which is heard when his wind gives out. We shall  discuss the theory of such sounds as these later, and shall find that they  are not produced by absolutely simple vibrations like those of the tuning-  fork or pendulum.   SIMULTANEOUS VIBRATIONS   Many structures are capable of vibrating in more than one way, and so  may often be performing several different vibrations at the same time.  There is a very general principle in mechanics, which asserts that when  any structure whatever is set into vibration^rovided only that the dis  placement of each particle is small the motion of every particle is either  a simple harmonic motion or else is a more complicated motion which  results from superposing a number of simple harmonic motions, one for  each vibration which is in progress.   A simple illustration will shew how this can be. Let us suppose that  while our tuning-fork is in vibration we hit it on the top of one of the  prongs with a hammer. We shall hear a sharp metallic click, which is       FIGURE 7 The superposition of two vibrations. The two wavy curves in (a) have periods which  stand in the ratio of 6V4 to 1. On superposing them we obtain the curve <&>, which  represents very closely the sound-curve of a tuning-fork which is sounding its clang tone.     Mathematics of Music 2287   known as the "clang tone" of the fork. A good musical ear may perhaps  recognise that its pitch lies about 2 1 A octaves above the ordinary note of  the fork. Clearly the blow of the hammer has started new vibrations in the  fork, of much higher frequency than the original vibration. If we had  taken a trace of the motion when the original vibration was acting alone  we should have obtained a curve like that shewn in Figure 8. This Is  reproduced as the long-waved curve in Figure l(a). If we take a trace of  the clang tone alone, it will be like the short-waved curve in Figure 7  (a), this representing a simple harmonic motion having 6*/i times the  frequency of the main vibration.   Now suppose we take a trace when the two vibrations are going on  together. At the instant of time represented at the point P, the particle  under consideration is displaced through a distance PQ by the main vibra  tion, and through a distance PR by the vibration which produces the  clang tone. Thus the operation of the two vibrations together displaces it  through a distance PQ 4- PR, and this is equal to PS if we make QS equal  to PR. By adding together displacements in this way all along the curve,  we obtain the curve shewn in Figure 7(b) as the trace to be expected  when both vibrations are in action together. The photograph of an actual  trace is shewn in Figure 9.   In addition to the clang tone just mentioned, we may often hear a  second clang tone about four octaves higher than the fundamental note  of the fork. Indeed, it is difficult to start the fork sounding in such a way  that the pure tone of the fork is heard without any admixture of these  higher tones. We more usually obtain a mixture of all three tones, but  this does not interfere with the utility of the tuning-fork as a source of  pure musical tone, since the sounds of higher frequency die away quite  rapidly, and the ear soon hears nothing but the fundamental tone of the  fork.      FIGURE 8 The sound-curve of the simple tone from a tuning-fork. The note is of frequency 256  (middle C), and the dots indicate intervals of J^oo second.     2288     Sir James Jeans     A second example of simultaneous vibrations can be made to teach us  something new. If we return to our weight suspended by a string and  knock it sideways, it will swing from side to side pendulum-wise through     FIGURE 9 The sound-curve of the note from a tuning-fork when the clang tone is sounding. The  clang tone superposes small waves onto the longer waves, shewn in Figure 8 above,   which represent the main tone of the fork.     SOUND-CURVES OF A TUNING-FORK.   some such path as AB in Figure 5 (p. 2284), and its motion, as we have  already seen, will be simple harmonic motion. Suppose, however, that  when the weight is at B, we give it another slight knock in the direction  at right angles to AB, i.e., through the paper of our page in Figure 5.  This sets up a new vibration in a direction at right angles to AB, and  the motion in this direction also must be simple harmonic motion. As  we have seen that the period of a pendulum depends only on its length,     A     B A     Vl/      FIGURE 10 FIGURE 11 FIGURE 12   FIGURES 10, II and 12 Three^different types qf motion which can be executed by the bob of a  conical pendulum.   the new motion will have the same period as the original motion. The  whole motion is accordingly obtained from the superposition of two  simple harmonic motions whose periods are equal.     Mathematics of Music 2289   If we watch the weight from a point directly above it, we shall see it  moving in a curved path round its central position C. If the second knock  was violent, its path will be an elongated ellipse such as AA'BB' in Figure  10. If the knock was gentle, its path will be an ellipse elongated in the  other direction such as AA'BB' in Figure 11. But if the knock was of  precisely the same strength as that which originally set the pendulum in  motion along AB, then the weight will move in the circle AA'BB' in  Figure 12, forming the arrangement which is generally described as a  conical pendulum. It must move with the same speed at each point of its  journey, for it is moving in a perfectly level path, so that there is no reason  why it should move faster at any one point than at any other.   Thus we learn that each of the motions illustrated in Figures 10, 11  and 12 can be regarded as the superposition of two simple harmonic  motions of equal periods. The last of the three is by far the most interest-      FIGURE 13 A geometrical interpretation of simple harmonic motion. As the point P moves  steadily around the circle, the point N moves backwards and forwards along AB, and  its motion is simple harmonic motion.   ing, because it shews us that a simple circular motion performed at uni  form speed can be regarded as made up of two simple harmonic motions  in directions at right angles to one another. To put this more definitely,  let us imagine that the point P in Figure 13 moves round the circle  AA'BB' with uniform speed, like the hand of a clock. Wherever P is, let  us draw perpendiculars PN, PM on to the lines AB, A f B f . Then, as P  moves steadily round the circle, N moves backwards and forwards along  AB, while M moves backwards and forwards along A'B\ We have learnt  that the motion of each of these points will be simple harmonic motion.   This gives us a simple geometrical explanation of simple harmonic  motion as P moves steadily round in a circle, the point N moves in  simple harmonic motion. It is easy to see from this definition that the  motion of the piston in the cylinder of a locomotive or a motor-car must  be approximately simple harmonic motion.   Or we may look at the problem from the other end, and see that as the  point N moves to-and-fro in simple harmonic motion along AB, the point     Sir James Jeans   P moves steadily round the circle AA'BW. This circle is called the "circle  of reference" of the simple harmonic motion. Its diameter AB is called  the "extent" of the motion, while its radius CA or CB is called the "ampli  tude" of the motion.   ENERGY   The amplitude of a vibration gives an indication of its energy, for it is  a general law that the energy of a vibration is proportional to the square  of the amplitude. For instance, a vibration which has twice the amplitude  of another has four times the energy of the other; in other words, the  vibrating structure to which it belongs has four times as much capacity  for doing work stored up within itself, and it must get rid of this in some  way or other before it can come to rest. The energy stored up in a musical  instrument is usually expended in setting the air around it into vibration;  indeed it is only through its steady outpouring of energy into the surround  ing air that we hear the instrument at all.   It follows that if we want to maintain a vibration at the same level of  energy we must continually supply energy to it as we do with an organ-  pipe or a violin-string. If energy is not supplied the vibration will die away  as with a piano-string or a bell or a cymbal. The amplitude of the  vibration then slowly decreases, and the circle of reference shrinks in size.   When a structure is performing several vibrations at the same time,  energy does not usually pass from one vibration to another. The vibrations  are independent, each possessing its own private store of energy which  it preserves intact, except for what it may pass on to other outside struc  tures as for instance, the air around it. Thus the energy of a number  of simultaneous vibrations may be thought of as the sum of the energies of  the separate vibrations.   SIMULTANEOUS SOUNDS   When a tuning-fork is sounding, every particle of its substance moves in  simple harmonic motion, and those particles which form its surface trans  mit their motion to the surrounding air. The final result is that every  particle of air which is at all near to the tuning-fork is set into motion  and moves with a simple harmonic motion, which will naturally have  the same period as the tuning-fork. This period is still preserved when the  vibration is passed on to the ear-drum of a listener that is why the note  heard by the ear has the same pitch as the fork,   A more complicated situation arises when two tuning-forks are standing  side by side. Each then imposes a simple harmonic motion on to the  particle of air, so that this has a motion which is obtained by superposing  the two motions.   We must study motions of this kind in some detail, because they are of     Mathematics of Music     2291     great importance in the practical problems of music. We begin with the  simplest problem of all the superposition of two motions which have the  same period. The resulting motion is that which would be forced on a  particle of air by the simultaneous vibrations of two forks of the same  pitch standing side by side.   SUPERPOSING VIBRATIONS OF THE SAME PERIOD   The two simple harmonic motions can be represented by two simple  harmonic curves, such as those which pass through X and Y in Figure 14.  These particular curves have been drawn with their amplitudes in the  ratio of 5 to 2, so that YN %XN, and the same relation holds all along      FIGURE 14 The superposition of two simple harmonic motions of equal period. Here the vibra  tory motions (represented by the thin curves) are "in the same phase" crest over  crest and trough over trough. The vibrations now reinforce one another, and their  resultant (represented by the thick curve) has an amplitude which is equal to the  sum of the amplitudes of the two constituents.   the curves. At the instant of time represented at the point N, the first  harmonic motion produces a displacement through a distance XN, while  the second produces a displacement through a distance YN which is %  times XN. Thus the combined effect of the two motions is a displacement  through a distance equal to 1% times XN. This is represented by ZN in  Figure 14.   The thick curve through Z is drawn so that its distance above or below  the central line is everywhere exactly 1% times that of the thin curve  through X. This curve must then represent the motion of which we are  in search. It is simply the thin curve through X magnified 1% times verti  cally, while its horizontal dimensions remain unchanged. Thus the new  motion is a simple harmonic motion having an amplitude equal to the  sum of the amplitudes of the constituent motions, and the same period  as both.   The foregoing instance is only a very special case of the general prob  lem, for the thin curves in Figure 14 are drawn in a very special way. The  crests of the waves of the two curves occur at the same instants, as also     2292     Sir James Jeans      FIGURE I5-The superposition of two simple harmonic motions of equal period. Here the vibra  tory motions (represented by the thin curves) are "in opposite phase" crest over  trough and trough over crest. The constituent vibrations now pull in opposite direc  tions, and so partially neutralise one another, the amplitude of their resultant (repre  sented by the thick curve) being equal to the difference of the amplitudes of the two  constituents.   the troughs; in the diagram, crest lies directly over crest and trough over  trough. Vibrations in which this relation holds are said to be "in the same  phase."   The curves might equally well have been drawn as in Figure 15, the  crests of one set of waves occurring at the same instants as the troughs  of the other set. Vibrations in which this relation holds are said to be "in  opposite phase." Crest lies over trough and vice versa, so that the two  constituents produce displacements in opposite directions. The resultant  motion is again that shewn in the thick curve, but its amplitude is no  longer (1 + %) times the amplitude of the larger constituent, but only  (!?) times.   We must not, however, expect as a matter of course that two motions  which occur simultaneously will be either in the same, or in opposite,  phase. Such simplicity is unusual, and it is far more likely that the crests          FIGURE 16 The superposition of two simple harmonic motions of equal period. Here there is no  simple phase relation between the two constituent vibratory motions (represented by  the thin curves), but their resultant is still a simple harmonic motion (represented by  the thick curve).     Mathematics of Music     2293     of one set of waves will be neither over the crests nor over the troughs of  the other set, but somewhere in between, as shewn in Figure 16. If we  add together the displacements represented by the two thin curves here,  using the method illustrated in Figure 14 (i.e., making ZN = XN + YN,  and so on), we shall find that the resultant motion is represented by the  thick curve shewn in the figure. We may judge by eye that this is yet  another simple harmonic curve, as in actual fact it is, but we can only  prove this by a new method of attack on the problem, to which we now  turn.   We have seen that any simple harmonic motion can be derived from  the steady motion of a point round a circle. For instance, as the point P  moves round the circle in Figure 13, the point N moves backwards and  forwards along the line AB in simple harmonic motion. The two simple  harmonic motions which we now want to superpose can of course be  derived from the motions of two points, each moving steadily round a  circle of its own. Let the two points be P and Q in Figure 17, so that the      FIGURE 17 The superposition of two simple harmonic motions. As P and Q move round their  respective circles, N and O execute simple harmonic motions. The resultant motion  is that executed by 5, because CO -f CN = CS.   points N t O immediately beneath them execute the simple harmonic  motions with which we are concerned.   At the instant to which Figure 17 refers, the motion of P has produced  a displacement CN, while that of Q has produced a displacement CO,  so that the total displacement, being the sum of the two, is equal to  CO + CN.     Sir James Jeans  2294   To represent this in Figure 17, we start from Q, and draw the Une QR  inl d ection paraUel to CP and of length equal to CP. Then, became  OK and CP are parallel and equal, the length OS which lies directly  under QR must be exactly equal to the length CN which lies directly Bunder  CP. Hence the sum we need, namely CO + CN, must be equal to  /"V) -4~ f) ^ 3j"id so to CS*   Thus as P and Q move round their respective circles, the points N and  O execute the two constituent simple harmonic motions, and the point S  executes the motion which results from their superposition.   We are at present supposing the two simple harmonic motions per  formed by N and O to be of the same frequency, so that the radii CP  and CQ rotate at exactly the same rate and the angle PCQ remains al  ways the same. Indeed, we can visualise the whole motion by imagining  that we cut the parallelogram CPRQ out of cardboard, and then make it  rotate round C at the same rate as P and Q. We see that R will move in a  circle at uniform speed, so that S will move backwards and forwards along  AB in simple harmonic motion. This shews that when two simple har  monic motions have the same frequency, the result of superposing them  is a third simple harmonic motion of the same frequency as both. In terms  of music, the simultaneous sounding of two pure tones of the same pitch  produces' a pure tone which is still of the same pitch. . . .   THE VIBRATIONS OF STRINGS AND HARMONICS   We began our study of sound-curves by examining the curve produced   by a tuning-fork. A tuning-fork was chosen, because it emits a perfectly   pure tone. But, as every musician knows, its sound is not only perfectly   pure, but is also perfectly uninteresting to a musical ear just because it   is so pure.   The artistic eye does not find pleasure in the simple figures of the geom  eterthe straight line, the triangle or the circle but rather in a subtle  blend of these in which the separate ingredients can hardly be distin  guished. In the same way, the painter finds but little interest in the pure  colours of his paint-box; his real interest lies in creating subtle, rich or  delicate blends of these. It is the same in music; our ears do not find  pleasure in the simple tones we have so far been studying but in intricate  blends of these. The various musical instruments provide us with ready-  made blends, which we can combine still further at our discretion.   In the present chapter we shall consider the sounds which are emitted  by stretched strings such as, for instance, are employed in the piano,  violin, harp, zither and guitar and we shall find how to interpret  these as blends of the pure tones we have already had under consider  ation.     Mathematics of Music     2295     EXPERIMENTS WITH THE MONOCHORD   Our source of sound will no longer be a tuning-fork but an instrument  which was known to the ancient Greek mathematicians, Pythagoras in  particular, and is still to be found in every acoustical laboratory the  monochord.   Its essentials are shewn in Figure 18. A wire, with one end A fastened  rigidly to a solid framework of wood, passes over a fixed bridge B and      FIGURE 18 The monochord. The string is kept in a state of tension by the suspended weight W,  while "bridges" like those of a violin limit the vibration to a range BC. The instru  ment is arranged so that both range and tension are under control.   a movable bridge C, after which it passes over a freely turning wheel D,  its other end supporting a weight W. This weight of course keeps the wire  in a state of tension, and we can make the tension as large or small as we  please by altering the weight. Only the piece BC of the string is set into  vibration, and as the bridge C can be moved backwards and forwards, this  can be made of any length we please. It can be set in vibration in a  variety of ways by striking it, as in the piano; by stroking it with a bow,  as in the violin; by plucking it, as in the harp; possibly even by blowing  over it as in the Aeolian harp, or as the wind makes the telegraph wires  whistle on a cold windy day.   On setting the string vibrating in any of these ways, we hear a musical  note of definite pitch. While this is still sounding, let us press with our  hand on the weight W. We shall find that the note rises in pitch, and the  harder we press on the weight, the greater the rise will be. The pressure  of our hand has of course increased the tension in the string, so that we  learn that increasing the tension of a string raises the pitch of the note it  emits. This is the way in which the violinist and piano-tuner tune their  strings and wires; when one of these is too low in pitch, they screw up the  tuning-key.   A series of experiments will disclose the exact relation between the  pitch and the tension of a string. Suppose that the string originally sounds  c' (middle C), the tension being 10 Ib. To raise the note an octave, to c",     Sir fames Jeans  2296   we shall find we must increase the tension to 40 lb.; to raise it yet another  octave to c'", we need a total tension of 160 lb., and so on. In each case a  fourfold increase in the tension is needed to double the frequency of the  note sounded, and we shall find that this is always the case. It is a general  law that the frequency is proportional to the square root of the tension.   We can also experiment on the effect of changing the length of our  string, repeating experiments such as were performed by Pythagoras some  2500 years ago. Sliding the bridge C in Figure 18 to the right shortens  the effective length EC of the string, but leaves the tension the same that  necessary to support the weight W. When we shorten the string, we find  that the pitch of the sound rises. If we halve its length, the pitch rises  exactly aa octave, shewing that the period of vibration has also been  halved. By experimenting with the bridge C in all sorts of positions, we  discover the general law that the period is exactly proportional to the  length of the string, so that the frequency of vibration varies inversely as  the length of the string. This law is exemplified in all stringed instruments.  In the violin, the same string is made to give out different notes by altering  its effective length by touching it with the finger. In the pianoforte differ  ent notes are obtained from wires of different lengths.   We may experiment in the same way on the effect of changing the  thickness or the material of our wire.      FIGURE 19      FIGURE 20     FIGURE 21   FIGURES 19, 20 and 21 Characteristic vibrations of a stretched string. The string vibrates in one,  two and three equal parts respectively, and emits its fundamental tone,  the octave and the twelfth of this in so doing.   MERSENNE'S LAWS   The knowledge gained from all these experiments can be summed up  in the following laws, which were first formulated by the French mathe  matician Mersenne (Harmonie Universelle, 1636):     Mathematics of Music 2297   I. When a string and its tension remain unaltered, but the length is  varied, the period of vibration is proportional to the length. (The law of  Pythagoras.)   II. When a string and its length remain unaltered, but the tension is  varied, the frequency of vibration is proportional to the square root of  the tension.   III. For different strings of the same length and tension, the period of  vibration is proportional to the square root of the weight of the string.   The operation of all these laws is illustrated in the ordinary pianoforte.  The piano-maker could obtain any range of frequencies he wanted by  using strings of different lengths but similar structure, the material and  tension being the same in all. But the IVi octaves range of the modern  pianoforte contains notes whose frequencies range from 27 to 4096. If  the piano-maker relied on the law of Pythagoras alone, his longest string  would have to be more than 150 times the length of his shortest, so that  either the former would be inconveniently long, or the latter incon  veniently short. He accordingly avails himself of the two other laws of  Mersenne. He avoids undue length of his bass strings by increasing their  weight usually by twisting thinner copper wire spirally round them. He  avoids inconvenient shortness of his treble strings by increasing their  tension. This had to be done with caution in the old wooden-frame piano,  since the combined tension of more than 200 stretched strings imposed a  great strain on a wooden structure. The modern steel frame can, however,  support a total tension of about 30 tons with safety, so that piano-wires  can now be screwed up to tensions which were formerly quite impracti  cable. . . .   HARMONIC ANALYSIS   Several times already we have superposed two simple harmonic curves,  and studied the new curves resulting from the superposition. The essence  of the process of superposition has already been illustrated in Figure 7 (a)  on p. 2286, and Figure 14 on p. 2291. In each of these cases the number  of superposed curves is only two; when a greater number of such curves  is superposed, the resultant curve may be of a highly complicated form.   There is a branch of mathematics known as "harmonic analysis" which  deals with the converse problem of sorting out the resultant curve into its  constituents. Superposing a number of curves is as simple as mixing chemi  cals in a test-tube; anyone can do it. But to take the final mixture and  discover what ingredients have gone into its composition may require  great skill.   Fortunately the problem is easier for the mathematician than for the  analytical chemist. There is a very simple technique for analysing any  curve, no matter how complicated it may be, into its constituent simple     Sir James Jeans  2298   harmonic curves. It is based on a mathematical theorem known as  Fourier's theorem, after its discoverer, the famous French mathematician  J. B. J. Fourier (1768-1830).   The theorem tells us that every curve, no matter what its nature may be,  or in what way it was originally obtained, can be exactly reproduced  by superposing a sufficient number of simple harmonic curves in brief,  every curve can be built up by piling up waves.   The theorem further tells us that we need only use waves of certain  specified lengths. If, for instance, the original curve repeats itself regularly  at intervals of one foot, we need only employ curves which repeat them  selves regularly 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. times every foot i.e., waves of lengths  12, 6, 4, 3, etc. inches. This is almost obvious, for waves of other lengths,  such 'as' 18 or 5 inches, would prevent the composite curve repeating  regularly every foot. If the original curve does not repeat regularly, we  treat its whole length as the first half-period 2 of a curve which does  repeat, and obtain the theorem in its more usual form. It tells us that the  original curve can be built up out of simple harmonic constituents such  that the first has one complete half-wave within the range of the original  curve, the second has two complete half-waves, the third has three, and  so on; constituents which contain fractional parts of half-waves need not  be employed at all. There is a fairly simple rule for calculating the ampli  tudes of the various constituents, but this lies beyond the scope of the  present book.   We obtain a first glimpse into the way of using this theorem if we sup  pose our original curve to be the curve assumed by a stretched string at  any instant of its vibration. Figures 19, 20 and 21 on p. 2296 shew groups  of simple harmonic curves which contain one, two and three complete  half-waves respectively within the range of the string. Let us imagine this  series of diagrams extended indefinitely so as to exhibit further simple  hannonic curves containing 4, 5, 6, 7 and all other numbers of complete  half-waves. Then the series of curves obtained in this way is precisely the  series of constituent curves required by the theorem. We take one curve  out of each diagram, and superpose them all; the theorem tells us that  by a suitable choice of these curves, the final resultant curve can be made  to agree with any curve we happen to have before us. Or, to state it the  other way round, any curve we please can be analysed into constituent  curves, one of which will be taken from Figure 19, one from Figure 20,  one from Figure 21, and so on.   This is not, of course, the only way in which a curve can be decom  posed into a number of other curves. Indeed, the number of ways is  infinite, just as there is an infinite number of ways hi which a piece of   2 It might seem simpler to treat the original curve as a whole period of a repeating  curve, but there are mathematical reasons against this.     Mathematics of Music 2299   paper can be torn into smaller pieces. But the way just mentioned is  unique in one respect, and this makes it of the utmost importance in the  theory of music. For when we decompose the curve of a vibrating string  into simple harmonic curves in this particular way, we are in effect decom  posing the motion of the string into its separate free vibrations, and these  represent the constituent tones in the note sounded by the vibration. As  the vibratory motion proceeds, each of these free vibrations persists with  out any change of strength, apart from the gradual dying away already  explained. If, on the other hand, we had decomposed the vibration in any  other way, the strength of the constituent vibrations would be continually  changing probably hundreds of times a second and so would have no  reference to the musical quality of the sound produced by the main  vibration.   So general a theory as this may well seem confused and highly compli  cated, but a single detailed illustration will bring it into sharp focus and  shew its importance.   STRING PLUCKED AT ITS MIDDLE POINT   Let us displace the middle point of a stretched string AB to C 9 so that  the string forms a flat triangle ACB as in Figure 22. The shape of the  string ACB may still be regarded as a curve, although a somewhat unusual  one, and our theorem tells us that this "curve" can be obtained from the  superposition of a number of simple harmonic curves. In actual fact,  Figure 23 shews how the curve ACB can be resolved into its constituent  curves; if we superpose all the curves shewn in this latter figure, we shall  find we have restored our original broken line ACB, except for a differ  ence in scale; the vertical scale in Figure 23 has been made ten times the  horizontal in order that the fluctuations of the higher harmonics may be  the more clearly seen.   Suppose we now let go of the point C, and allow the natural motion of  the string to proceed. We may imagine each of the curves shewn in Figure  23 to decrease and increase rhythmically in its own proper period, and  the superposition of the curves at any instant will give us the shape of the  string at that instant. These curves correspond to the various harmonics  that are sounded on plucking a string at its middle point.   We notice that the second, fourth and sixth harmonics are absent. This  is not a general property of harmonics, but is peculiar to the special case  we have chosen. We have plucked the string in such a way 4hat its two  halves are bound to move in similar fashion, and as a consequence the  second, fourth and sixth harmonics, which necessarily imply dissimilarity  in the two halves, cannot possibly appear. If we had plucked it anywhere  else than at its middle point, some at least of these harmonics would  have been present.     2300     Sir James Jeans      FIGURE 22      First harmonic  Second harmonic  Third harmonic  Fourth harmonic  Fifth harmonic  Sixth harmonic  Seventh harmonic     FIGURE 23   FIGURES 22 and 23 The string is displaced to form the triangle ACB. This "curve" can be ana  lysed into the simple harmonic curves shewn in Figure 20. On superposing  these we restore the "curve" ACB of Figure 19. (The vertical scales in  Figure 23 are all magnified ten-fold.)   ANALYSIS OF A SOUND-CURVE   Let us next apply Fourier's theorem to a piece of a sound-curve. The  theorem tells us that any sound-curve whatever can be reproduced by the  superposition of suitably chosen simple harmonic waves. Consequently  any sound, no matter how complex whether the voice of a singer or a  motor-bus changing gear can be analysed into pure tones and reproduced  exactly by a battery of tuning-forks, or other sources of pure tone. Pro  fessor Dayton Miller has built up groups of organ-pipes, which produce  the various vowels when sounded in unison; other groups say papa and  mama.   The sound-curve of a musical sound is periodic; it recurs at perfectly  regular intervals. Indeed, we have seen that this is the quality which distin  guishes music from noise. Fourier's theorem tells us that such a sound-     Mathematics of Music 2301   curve can be made up by the superposition of simple harmonic curves  such that 1, 2, 3, or some other integral number of complete waves occur  within each period of the original curve. If, for instance, the sound-curve  has a frequency of 100, it can be reproduced by the superposition of  simple harmonic curves of frequencies 100, 200, 300, etc.   Each of these curves represents a pure tone, whence we see that any  musical sound of frequency 100 is made up of pure tones having respec  tively 1, 2, 3, etc. times the frequency of the original sound. These tones  are called the "natural harmonics" of the note in question.   NATURAL HARMONICS AND RESONANCE   Vibrations are often set up in a vibrating structure by a force or disturb  ance which continually varies hi strength; such a force may be periodic in  the sense that the variations repeat themselves at regular intervals.  Fourier's theorem now tells us that a variable force of this kind can be  resolved into a number of constituent forces each of which varies in a  simple harmonic manner, and that the frequencies of these forces will be  1, 2, 3 . . . times that of the total force. For instance, if the force repeats  itself 100 times a second, the simple harmonic constituents of the force  will repeat themselves 100, 200, 300, etc., tunes a second.   If the structure has free vibrations of frequencies 100, 200, 300, etc.,  these will be set vibrating strongly by resonance, while any vibrations of  other frequencies that the structure may possess will not be set going in  any appreciable strength. In other words, a disturbing force only excites  by resonance the "natural harmonics" of a tone of the same period as  itself.   This is a result of great importance to music in general. Amongst other  things, it explains why the stretched string has such outstanding musical  qualities; the reason is simply that its free vibrations coincide exactly in  frequency with the natural harmonics of its fundamental tone, so that  when the fundamental tone is set going, the harmonics are set going as  well. . . .   HEARING   We have now considered the generation of sound and its transmission  through the air to the ear; we must finally consider its reception by the  ear, and transmission to the brain.   When the air is being traversed by sound-waves, we have seen that the  pressure at every point changes rhythmically, being now above and now  below the average steady pressure of the atmosphere just as, when  ripples pass over the surface of a pond, the height of water in the pond  changes rhythmically at every point, being now above and now below the  average steady height when the water is at rest. The same is of course     Sir James Jeans  2502     true of the small layer of air which lies in contact with ^^^  Si changes of pressure in this layer which cause the sensation of hearing.  ? greafer the changes of pressure, the more intense the sound, for we  Sve ien that the energy of a sound-wave is proportional to the square  of the range through which the pressure vanes.   ^pressure changes with which we are most familiar are those shewn  on o Jr barometers -half an inch of mercury, for instance. The pressure  changes which enter into the propagation of sound are far smaller; indeed  they are so much smaller that a new unit is needed for measuring them-  the "bar." For exact scientific purposes, this is defined as a pressure of a  dyne per square centimetre, but for our present purpose it is enough to  know that a bar is very approximately a millionth part of the whole pres  sure of the atmosphere. When we change the height of our ears above the  earth's surface by about a third of an inch, the pressure on our ear-drums  changes by a bar; when we hear a fairly loud musical sound, the pressure  on our ear-drums again changes about a bar.   THE THRESHOLD OF HEARING   Suppose that we gradually walk away from a spot where a musical note  is being continuously sounded. The amount of energy received by our ears  gradually diminishes, and we might perhaps expect that the intensity of  the sound heard by our brains would dimmish in the same proportion.  We shall, however, find that this is not so; the sound diminishes for a  time, and then quite suddenly becomes inaudible. This shews that the  loudLess of the sound we hear is not proportional to the energy which  falls on our ears; if the energy is below a certain amount we hear nothing  at all. The smallest intensity of sound which we can hear is said to be at  "the threshold of hearing."   We obtain direct evidence that such a threshold exists if we strike a  tuning-fork and let its vibrations gradually die away. A point is soon  reached at which we hear nothing. Yet the fork is still vibrating, and emit  ting sound, as can be proved by pressing its handle against any large hard  surface, such as a table-top. This, acting as a sound-board, amplifies the  sound so much that we can hear it again. Without this amplification the  sound lay below the threshold of hearing; the amplification has raised it  above the threshold.   In possessing a threshold of this kind, hearing is exactly in line with all  the other senses; with each our brains are conscious of nothing at all until  the stimulus reaches a certain "threshold" degree of intensity. The thresh  old of seeing, for instance, is of special importance in astronomy; our  eyes see stars down to a certain limit of faintness, roughly about 6-5  magnitudes, and beyond this see nothing at all. Just as a sound-board may     Mathematics of Music 23OT   raise the sound of a tuning-fork above the threshold of hearing, so a  telescope raises the light of a faint star above the threshold of seeing.   We naturally enquire what is the smallest amount of energy that must  fall on our ears in order to make an impression on our brains? In other  words, how much energy do our ears receive at their threshold of hearing?   The answer depends enormously on the pitch of the sound we are trying  to hear, Somewhere in the top octave of the pianoforte there is a pitch at  which the sensitivity of the ear is a maximum, and here a very small  amount of sound energy can make itself heard, but when we pass to  tones of either higher or lower pitch, the ear is less sensitive, so that more  energy is needed to produce the same impression of hearing. Beyond these  tones we come to others of very high and very low pitch, which we cannot  hear at all unless a large amount of energy falls on our ears, and finally,  still beyond these, tones which no amount of energy can make us hear,  because they lie beyond the limits of hearing.   The following table contains results which have been obtained by  Fletcher and Munson, 3 The first two columns give the pitch and frequency  of the tone under discussion, the next column gives the pressure variation  at which the tone first becomes audible, while the last column gives the  amount of energy needed at this pitch in terms of that needed at f T , at  which the energy required is least:     Tone    Frequency    Pressure  variation at  which note  is first  heard    Energy required in  terms of minimum    CCCC (32-ft pipe of    16    100 bars    1,500,000,000,000    organ; close to lower          limit of hearing)  AAA (bottom note of    27    1 bar    150,000,000    piano)  CCC (lowest C on    32    % "    25,000,000    piano)  CC    64    %o "    100,000    c    128    %>o ;;    3,800    c' (middle C)  c"    256  512    %000  ^500    150  25    c'"    1,024    %ooo ;;    6    C^    2,048    Moooo " t    1.5    f lv (maximum sensitiv    2,734    %2500    1.0    ity)  c v (top of piano)  c vl    4,096  8,192    -if ii   rioooo  %ooo "    1.5   38    c vii   Close to upper limit of    16,384  20,000    Woo "  500 bars    15,000  38,000,000,000,000    hearing           3 Many other investigators have worked at the problem, their results generally  agreeing fairly closely, although not always exactly, with those stated in the table.  Investigations, by Andrade and Parker (1937), yield results which are in very close  agreement with those of Fletcher and Munson.     2304     Sir James Jeans     We see that the ear can respond to a very small variation of pressure  when the tone is of suitable pitch. Throughout the top octave of the piano,  less than a ten-thousand-miliionth part of an atmosphere suffices; as  already mentioned, this is produced by an air-displacement of less than  a ten-thousand-millionth part of an inch, which again is only about a  hundredth part of the diameter of a molecule.   We also notice the immense range of figures in the last column. Our  ears are acutely sensitive to sound within the top two octaves of the piano,  and quite deaf, at least by comparison, to tones which are far below or  above this range; to make a pure tone of pitch CCCC audible needs a  million million times more energy than is needed for one seven octaves  higher.   The structure of an ordinary organ provides visual confirmation of this.  The pipe of pitch CCCC is a huge 32-foot monster, with a foot opening  which absorbs an enormous amount of wind, and yet it hardly sounds  louder than a tiny metal pipe perhaps three inches long taken from the  treble. A child can blow the latter pipe quite easily from its mouth, but  the whole force of a man's lungs will not make the 32-foot pipe sound  audibly. . . .     THE SCALE OF SOUND INTENSITY   The change in the intensity of a sound which results from a tenfold in  crease in the energy causing this sound is called a "bel." The word has  nothing to do with beauty or charm, but is merely three-quarters of the  surname of Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone.   We have already thought of this tenfold increase as produced by ten  equal steps of approximately 25 per cent. each. More exactly, each of  these must represent an increase by a factor of \/(10), of which the value  is 1 2589. Each of these steps of a tenth of a bel is known as a "decibel";  as we have seen, it represents just about the smallest change in sound in  tensity which our ears notice under ordinary conditions.   The intensity at the threshold of hearing is usually taken as zero  point, so that, if we take the smallest amount of energy we can hear  as unit;     1 ur  1-26  1-58  2  4   10  100  1000    lit c   u    >f ene   t <    rgy giv    es a sou    nd intei    isity c    f dec  1 dec  2 dec  3  6  9  10  20  30 '    ibels  tbel  bels   *    I  i    '      U I   tt I  (( I   U (   t< <             Mathematics of Music 2305   THE SCALE OF LOUDNESS   The scale of sound intensity had its zero fixed at the threshold of hear  ing, but as the position of this depends enormously on the pitch of the  sound under discussion, this scale is only useful in comparing the relative  loudnesses of two sounds of the same pitch. It is of no use for the com  parison of two sounds of different pitches. For this latter purpose we must  introduce a new scale, the scale of loudness.   The zero point of this scale is taken to be the loudness, as heard by the  average normal hearer, of a sound-wave in air, which has a frequency of  1000 and a pressure range of %ooo bar or, more precisely, 0-0002 dynes  at the ear of the listener. This, as we have already seen, is just about  the threshold of hearing for a sound of this particular frequency.   The unit on this scale is called a "phon." So long as we limit ourselves  to sounds of frequency 1000, the phon is taken to be the same thing as  the decibel, both as regards its amount and its zero point. Thus if a sound  of frequency 1000 has an intensity of x decibels on the scale of sound  intensity, it has a loudness of x phons on the new scale of loudness. But  the phon and decibel diverge when the frequency of the sound is different  from 1000. Two sounds of different pitch are said to have the same num  ber of phons of loudness when they sound equally loud to the ear. Thus  we say that a sound has a loudness of x phons when it sounds as loud to  the ear as a sound of frequency 1000 and an intensity of x decibels. Such  a sound lies at x decibels above the threshold of hearing for a sound of  frequency 1000, not above that for a sound of its own pitch. 4     THE THRESHOLD OF PAIN   We have already considered what is the smallest amount of sound we  can hear; we consider next what is the largest amount. This is not a mean  ingless problem. For, if we continually supply more and more energy to  a source of sound as for instance by beating a gong harder and harder  the sound will get louder and louder and, in time, we shall find it becom  ing too loud for pleasure. At first it is merely disagreeable, but from being  disagreeable it soon passes to being uncomfortable. Finally the vibrations  set up in our ear-drums and inner ear may become so violent as to give  us acute pain, and possibly injure our ears.   If we note the number of bels our ears can endure without discomfort,  we shall find that this again, like the position of the threshold of hearing,   4 This defines the British standard phon. The Americans use the same phon as the  British, but frequently describe it as a decibel. The Germans use a different zero point,  0-0003 dyne in place of 0-0002.     Sir James Jeans  2306   depends on the pitch of the sound. At the bass end of the pianoforte it is  about six bels; it has risen to eleven bels by middle C; it rises further to  twelve bels in the top octave of the pianoforte, after which it probably   falls rapidly.   The intensity of sound at the threshold of hearing, and also the range  above the threshold which we can endure without undue discomfort, both  vary greatly with the pitch of the sound, but their sum, which fixes a sort  of threshold of pain, varies much less. Throughout the greater part of the  range used in music, the intensity at this threshold is given by a pressure      FIGURE 24 The limits of the area of hearing, as determined by Fletcher and Munson. Each  point in this diagram represents a sound of a certain specified frequency (as shewn  on the scale at the bottom) and of a certain specified intensity (as shewn by the scale  on the left). If the point lies within the shaded area, the sound can be heard with  comfort. If the point lies above the shaded area, the hearing of the sound is painful.  If the point lies below the shaded area, the sound lies below the threshold of hear  ing, and so cannot be heard at all.   variation of about 600 bars, except that it falls to about 200 bars in the  region of maximum sensitivity.   We can represent this in a diagram as in Figure 24, and the shaded area  which is the area of hearing can be divided up further by curves of equiva  lent loudness as shewn in Figure 25. Both the limits of the area of hearing  and the curves of equal loudness have been determined by Fletcher and  Munson.   We see at a glance how the ear is both most sensitive to faint sound,  and also least tolerant to excessive sound, in the range of the upper half  of the piano. To be heard at a moderate comfortable loudness of say 50     Mathematics of Music     2307      20     6192     16384     in^fhorts     FIGURE 25 The loudness of sounds which lie within ihe area of hearing, as determined by  Fletcher and Munson. As in Figure 24, each point of the diagram represents a sound  of specified frequency (as shewn on the scale at the bottom) and of specified in  tensity in decibels (as shewn on the scale on the left), the zero point being the  faintest sound of frequency 1000 which can be heard at alL The loudness of the  sound in phons is the number written on the curved line which passes through the  point; thus these curves are curves of equal loudness.   or 60 phons, treble music needs but little energy, while bass music needs a  great deal. This is confirmed by exact measurements of the energy em  ployed in playing various instruments. The following table gives the results  of experiments made at the Bell Telephone Laboratories:     ORIGIN OF SOUND   Orchestra of seventy-five performers, at loudest . .

A fair-sized pipe organ may need a 10,000-watt motor to blow it;  of this energy only 13 watts reappears as sound, while the other 9987  watts is wasted in friction and heat. A strong man soon tires of playing a  piano at its loudest, his energy output being perhaps 200 watts; of this  only 0-4 watts goes into sound. A thousand basses singing fortissimo only  give out enough energy to keep one 30-watt lamp alight; if they turned  dynamos with equal vigour, 6000 such lamps could be kept alight.   The first and last entries in the table above represent the extreme range  of sounds heard in a concert room, and we notice that the former is more  than eighteen million times the latter. Yet this range, large though it is, is  only one of 7% bels, and so is not much more than half of the range of  12 bels which the ear can tolerate in treble sounds.   For a person well away from the instruments, we may perhaps estimate  the violin at its softest as being about 1 bel above the threshold of hearing  for the note it is playing, so that the full orchestra is about 8 3 bels, or  83 decibels. This may be compared with the intensities of various other  sounds, as shewn in the following table:   Threshold of hearing decibels   Gentle rustle of leaves 10 "   Quiet London garden 20   Whisper at 4 feet 20   Quiet suburban street, London 30 "   Quietest time at night, Central New York 40   Conversation at 12 feet 50   Busy traffic, London 60   Busy traffic, New York 68   Very heavy traffic, New York 82 "   Lion roaring at 18 feet 88   Subway station with express passing, New York 95 "   Boiler factory 98 "   Steel plate hammered by four men, 2 feet away . . 112 "   Owing to the different thresholds of hearing, the sounds in the above  tables are not strictly comparable, unless they happen to be of the same  pitch. The following table shews the differences of subjective loudness for  a few common sounds:   Threshold of hearing phons   Ticking of a watch at 3 feet 20   Sounds in a quiet residential street 40   Quiet conversation 60   Sounds in a busy main street 75   Sounds in a tube train 90   Sounds in a busy machine shop 100   Proximity of aeroplane engine 120   Experiments shew that a faint sound will not be heard at all through a  louder sound of the same pitch, if the difference in intensity is more than     Mathematics of Music 2309   about 1 - 2 bels, but the difference in loudness may be greater if the sounds  are of very different pitch. Conversation at 12 feet should just be heard  against busy traffic in London, because the difference in intensity only  amounts to 1 bels; it will not, however, be heard against busy traffic in  New York, because the difference here is 1 8 bels. In the same way a  roaring lion would only just be heard in a boiler factory, although he  might hope to attract considerable attention in a New York subway  station. . . .     PART XXV   Mathematics as  a Culture Clue     1 . Meaning of Numbers by OSWALD SPENGLER   2. The Locus of Mathematical Reality: An Anthropological  Footnote by LESLIE A. WHITE     COMMENTARY ON   OSWALD SPENGLER     kSWALD SPENGLER (1880-1936) was a sickly German high-school  teacher of apocalyptic inclination who at the age of thirty-one re  tired from his post to write an immense and sensational book on the phi  losophy of history. The book which brought fame to this obscure scholar  was The Decline of the West', it was conceived in 1911 and completed in  1917. Exempt from military service because of a weak heart and defective  eyesight, Spengler had ample time during the war years to elaborate his  theme; but throughout he was harassed by poverty and other adversities,  and only a sense of mission based on the conviction that he had discov  ered a great truth about "history and the philosophy of destiny" sustained  him. 1 In 1918 a reluctant Viennese publisher was persuaded to take the  book. It appeared in a small edition but in a few weeks began to sell. In  Germany, where its gloomy tone suited the post-war mood, the book pro  voked vehement controversy; abroad "it won the admiration of the half-  educated and the scorn of the judicious." 2 Now in another post-war period,  the issues raised by Spengler are again at the focus of attention. His theory  has found few adherents, yet it has impelled many thoughtful men to  sober reflection. "It is easy," as one critic has observed, "to criticize  Spengler, but not so easy to get rid of him." 3   Spengler's main thesis is that the patterns of history are cyclical, not  linear. Man does not improve. He experiences the inexorable biological  progression of "birth, growth, maturity and decay"; he accommodates  himself to circumstance, changing his ways in order to survive; but his  basic attitudes remain unchanged. The same principle applies to the several  cultures man has produced over the centuries. Like living organisms cul  tures flourish, decline and die. They do not progress; they merely recur.  Their course is as predestined as the course of their creators. In the history  of every culture there is discernible a "master pattern" 4 "a characteristic  cast of the human spirit working itself out." This master pattern shapes  each of the activities which compose the culture. While the master patterns  differ, and thus distinguish one culture from another, they pass inevitably   1 The words in quotation marks are Spengler's and are taken from the preface to  the English translation of his book, by Charles Francis Atkinson: The Decline of the  West: Form and Actuality, New York, 1926, p.

Stuart Hughes, Oswald Spengler, A Critical Estimate,  New York, 1952.   2 Hughes, op. cit., p. 1.   3 The Times Literary Supplement, October 3, 1952, p. 637.   4 This is A. L.

Spengler has epitomized his am  bitious program in these words:   "I hope to show that without exception all great creations and forms in  religion, art, politics, social life, economy and science appear, fulfill  themselves and die down contemporaneously in all the Cultures; that the  inner structure of one corresponds strictly with that of all the others; that  there is not a single phenomenon of deep physiognomic importance in the  record of one for which we could not find a counterpart in the record of  every other; and that this counterpart is to be found under a characteristic  form and in a perfectly definite chronological position." 5   Even in two massive volumes Spengler was unable to persuade men of  insight and dispassionate judgment that he had fulfilled his promise. Both  his arguments and his presentation were vulnerable. Scholars hacked at his  blunders, scientists at his pseudo-scientific reasoning, philosophers at his  conclusions, literary critics at his swollen, unlovely style. It was pointed  out that the cyclical view of history was a "hoary commonplace"; that  Spengler had borrowed his main ideas from his betters; that he was anti-  rational, pompously prophetic, crude and melodramatic. None of these  charges were altogether baseless; some, indeed, were painfully true. Yet  The Decline of the West contains elements of great originality, flashes of  extraordinary insight. Spengler exaggerated but he also brilliantly illumi  nated corners of history which less passionate philosophers had over  looked; his expression was pretentious but it was powerful. Above all, as  H. Stuart Hughes said in his recent excellent study: ". . . The Decline of  the West offers the nearest thing we have to a key to our times. It  formulates more comprehensively than any other single book the modern  malaise that so many feel and so few can express." 6     Spengler was convinced that mathematics is no exception to his prin  ciple of cultural parallelism. There are no eternal verities even in this most  abstract, seemingly disembodied intellectual activity. "There is not, and  cannot be, number as such. There are several number-worlds as there are  several Cultures." 7 Mathematics, like art or religion or politics, expresses  man's basic attitudes, his conception of himself; like the other elements  in a culture it exemplifies "the way in which a soul seeks to actualrtize  itself in the picture of its outer world." 8 The first selection below is taken  from the chapter "Meaning of Numbers," one of the most remarkable  discussions in The Decline of the West. It is unnecessary to agree with  Spengler's thesis to be stimulated by this performance. No one else has   5 Spengler, op. cit. y p. 112.   6 Hughes, op. cit. y p. 165.   7 Spengler, op. cit., p. 59.   8 Ibid., p. 56.     2314 Editor's Comment   made even a comparable attempt to cast a synoptic eye over the evolving  concept of number. A good deal of what Spengler has to say on this sub  ject strikes one as far-fetched and misty. But he was a capable mathema  tician; his ideas cannot be dismissed as hollow; and I think you will find  this a disturbing and exciting essay.   The second selection is less disturbing but no less exciting. It attacks  the question "Do mathematical truths reside in the external world, or are  they man-made inventions?" There are very few sensible discussions of  this problem. Leslie White's approach is that of a cultural anthropologist.  What he has to say is balanced and persuasive. It is worth comparing both  with Spengler's vehement opinions and with the moderate, lucidly reason  able views of Richard von Mises (see pp. 1723-1754). Dr. White is chair  man of the department of anthropology at the University of Michigan.  He has taught at the University of Chicago, Yale, Columbia and Yenching  University, Peiping, China. He has had extensive experience as a field  investigator among the Pueblo Indians. His best known book The Science  of Culture, was published in 1948.     In the study of ideas, it is necessary to remember that insistence on hard-  headed clarity issues from sentimental feeling, as it were a mist, cloaking  the perplexities of fact. Insistence on clarity at all costs is based on sheer  superstition as to the mode in which human intelligence functions. Our  reasonings grasp at straws for premises and float on gossamers for deduc  tions. ALFRED NORTH WHITEHEAD (Adventures in Ideas)     1 Meaning of Numbers   By OSWALD SPENGLER     IN order to exemplify the way in which a soul seeks to actualize itself in  the picture of its outer world to show, that is, in how far Culture in the  "become" state can express or portray an idea of human existence I have  chosen number, the primary element on which all mathematics rests. I  have done so because mathematics, accessible in its full depth only to the  very few, holds a quite peculiar position amongst the creations of the  mind. It is a science of the most rigorous kind, like logic but more com  prehensive and very much fuller; it is a true art, along with sculpture and  music, as needing the guidance of inspiration and as developing under  great conventions of form; it is, lastly, a metaphysic of the highest rank,  as Plato and above all Leibniz show us. Every philosophy has hitherto  grown up in conjunction with a mathematic belonging to it. Number is  the symbol of causal necessity. Like the conception of God, it contains  the ultimate meaning of the world-as-nature. The existence of numbers  may therefore be called a mystery, and the religious thought of every  Culture has felt their impress.   Just as all becoming possesses the original property of direction (irre~  versibility) , all things-become possess the property of extension. But these  two words seem unsatisfactory in that only -an artificial distinction can be  made between them. The real secret of all things-become, which are ipso  facto things extended (spatially and materially), is embodied in mathe  matical number as contrasted with chronological number. Mathematical  number contains in its very essence the notion of a mechanical demarca  tion, number being in that respect akin to word, which, in the very fact  of its comprising and denoting, fences off world-impressions. The deepest  depths, it is true, are here both incomprehensible and inexpressible. But  the actual number with which the mathematician works, the figure, for  mula, sign, diagram, in short the number-sign which he thinks, speaks or  writes exactly, is (like the exactly-used word) from the first a symbol of  these depths, something imaginable, communicable, comprehensible to  the inner and the outer eye, which can be accepted as representing the  demarcation. The origin of numbers resembles that of the myth. Primitive   2315     _,. , Oswald Spengter   2316   man elevates indefinable nature-impressions (the "alien," in our terminol  ogy) into deities, numina, at the same time capturing and impounding  them by a name which limits them. So also numbers are something that  marks off and captures nature-impressions, and it is by means of names  and numbers that the human understanding obtains power over the world.  In the last analysis, the number-language of a mathematic and the gram  mar of a tongue are structurally alike. Logic is always a kind of mathe  matic and vice versa. Consequently, in all acts of the intellect germane to  mathematical number measuring, counting, drawing, weighing, arrang  ing and dividing l men strive to delimit the extended in words as well, i.e.,  to set it forth in the form of proofs, conclusions, theorems and systems;  and it is only through acts of this kind (which may be more or less un-  intentioned) that waking man begins to be able to use numbers, norma-  tively, to specify objects and properties, relations and differentiae, unities  and pluralities briefly, that structure of the world-picture which he feels  as necessary and unshakable, calls "Nature" and "cognizes." Nature is the  numerable, while History, on the other hand, is the aggregate of that  which has no relation to mathematics hence the mathematical certainty  of the laws of Nature, the astounding Tightness of Galileo's saying that  Nature is "written in mathematical language," and the fact, emphasized  by Kant, that exact natural science reaches just as far as the possibilities  of applied mathematics allow it to reach. In number, then, as the sign of  completed demarcation, lies the essence of everything actual, which is  cognized, is delimited, and has become all at once as Pythagoras and  certain others have been able to see with complete inward certitude by a  mighty and truly religious intuition. Nevertheless, mathematics meaning  thereby the capacity to think practically in figures must not be confused  with the far narrower scientific mathematics, that is, the theory of num  bers as developed in lecture and treatise. The mathematical vision and  thought that a Culture possesses, within itself is as inadequately represented  by its written mathematic as its philosophical vision and thought by its  philosophical treatises. Number springs from a source that has also quite  other outlets. Thus at the beginning of every Culture we find an archaic  style, which might fairly have been called geometrical in other cases as  well as the Early Hellenic. There is a common factor which is expressly  mathematical in this early Classical style of the 10th Century B.C., in the  temple style of the Egyptian Fourth Dynasty with its absolutism of  straight line and right angle, in the Early Christian sarcophagus-relief,  and in Romanesque construction and ornament. Here every line, every  deliberately non-imitative figure of man and beast, reveals a mystic  number-thought in direct connexion with the mystery of death (the hard-  set).  1 Also "thinking in money."     Meaning of Numbers 2317   Gothic cathedrals and Doric temples are mathematics in stone. Doubt  less Pythagoras was the first in the Classical Culture to conceive number  scientifically as the principle of a world-order of comprehensible things  as standard and as magnitude but even before him it had found expres  sion, as a noble arraying of sensuous-material units, in the strict canon  of the statue and the Doric order of columns. The great arts are, one and  all, modes of interpretation by means of limits based on number (consider,  for example, the problem of space-representation in oil painting). A high  mathematical endowment may, without any mathematical science what  soever, come to fruition and full self-knowledge in technical spheres.   In the presence of so powerful a number-sense as that evidenced, even  in the Old Kingdom, 2 in the dimensioning of pyramid temples and in the  technique of building, water-control and public administration (not to  mention the calendar), no one surely would maintain that the valueless  arithmetic of Ahmes belonging to the New Empire represents the level of  Egyptian mathematics. The Australian natives, who rank intellectually as  thorough primitives, possess a mathematical instinct (or, what comes to  the same thing, a power of thinking in numbers which is not yet commu  nicable by signs or words) that as regards the interpretation of pure space  is far superior to that of the Greeks. Their discovery of the boomerang  can only be attributed to their having a sure feeling for numbers of a  class that we should refer to the higher geometry. Accordingly we shall  justify the adverb later they possess an extraordinarily complicated cere  monial and, for expressing degrees of affinity, such fine shades of language  as not even the higher Cultures themselves can show.   There is analogy, again, between the Euclidean mathematic and the  absence, in the Greek of the mature Periclean age, of any feeling either  for ceremonial public life or for loneliness, while the Baroque, differing  sharply from the Classical, presents us with a mathematic of spatial analy  sis, a court of Versailles and a state system resting on dynastic relations.   It is the style of a Soul that comes out in the world of numbers, and  the world of numbers includes something more than the science thereof.     From this there follows a fact of decisive importance which has hitherto  been hidden from the mathematicians themselves.   There is not, and cannot be, number as such. There are several number-  worlds as there are several Cultures. We find an Indian, an Arabian, a  Classical, a Western type of mathematical thought and, corresponding  with each, a type of number each type fundamentally peculiar and   3 Dynasties I-VIII, or, effectively, I-VL The Pyramid period coincides with Dynas  ties IV-VI. Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus belong to the IV dynasty, under which  also great water-control works were carried out between Abydos and the Fayum. Tr.     231g Oswald Spengler   unique, an expression of a specific world-feeling, a symbol having a spe  cific validity which is even capable of scientific definition, a principle of  ordering the Become which reflects the central essence of one and only  one soul, viz., the soul of that particular Culture. Consequently, there are  more mathematics than one. For indubitably the inner structure of the  Euclidean geometry is something quite different from that of the Carte  sian, the analysis of Archimedes is something other than the analysis of  Gauss, and not merely in matters of form, intuition and method but above  all in essence, in the intrinsic and obligatory meaning of number which  they respectively develop and set forth. This number, the horizon within  which it has been able to make phenomena self-explanatory, and therefore  the whole of the "nature" or world-extended that is confined in the given  limits and amenable to its particular sort of mathematic, are not common  to all mankind, but specific in each case to one definite sort of mankind.   The style of any mathematic which comes into being, then, depends  wholly on the Culture in which it is rooted, the sort of mankind it is that  ponders it. The soul can bring its inherent possibilities to scientific devel  opment, can manage them practically, can attain the highest levels in its  treatment of them but is quite impotent to alter them. The idea of the  Euclidean geometry is actualized in the earliest forms of Classical orna  ment, and that of the Infinitestimal Calculus in the earliest forms of  Gothic architecture, centuries before the first learned mathematicians of  the respective Cultures were born.   A deep inward experience, the genuine awakening of the ego^ which  turns the child into the higher man and initiates him into community of  his Culture, marks the beginning of number-sense as it does that of  language-sense. It is only after this that objects come to exist for the  waking consciousness as things limitable and distinguishable as to number  and kind; only after this that properties, concepts, causal necessity, system  in the world-around, a form of the world, and world laws (for that which  is set and settled is ipso facto bounded, hardened, number-governed) are  susceptible of exact definition. And therewith comes too a sudden, almost  metaphysical, feeling of anxiety and awe regarding the deeper meaning of  measuring and counting, drawing and form.   Now, Kant has classified the sum of human knowledge according to  syntheses a priori (necessary and universally valid) and a posteriori  (experiential and variable from case to case) and in the former class has  included mathematical knowledge. Thereby, doubtless, he was enabled to  reduce a strong inward feeling to abstract form. But, quite apart from the  fact (amply evidenced in modern mathematics and mechanics) that there  is no such sharp distinction between the two as is originally and uncondi  tionally implied in the principle, the a priori itself, though certainly one     Meaning of Numbers 2319   of the most inspired conceptions of philosophy, is a notion that seems to  involve enormous difficulties. With it Kant postulates without attempt  ing to prove what is quite incapable of proof both unalterableness of  form in all intellectual activity and identity of form for all men in the  same. And, in consequence, a factor of incalculable importance is thanks  to the intellectual prepossessions of his period, not to mention his own  simply ignored. This factor is the varying degree of this alleged "universal  validity." There are doubtless certain characters of very wide-ranging  validity which are (seemingly at any rate) independent of the Culture  and century to which the cognizing individual may belong, but along with  these there is a quite particular necessity of form which underlies all his  thought as axiomatic and to which he is subject by virtue of belonging to  his own Culture and no other. Here, then, we have two very different  kinds of a priori thought-content, and the definition of a frontier between  them, or even the demonstration that such exists, is a problem that lies  beyond all possibilities of knowing and will never be solved. So far, no  one has dared to assume that the supposed constant structure of the intel  lect is an illusion and that the history spread out before us contains more  than one style of knowing. But we must not forget that unanimity about  things that have not yet become problems may just as well imply universal  error as universal truth. True, there has always been a certain sense of  doubt and obscurity so much so, that the correct guess might have been  made from that non-agreement of the philosophers which every glance  at the history of philosophy shows us. But that this non-agreement is not  due to imperfections of the human intellect or present gaps in a perfectible  knowledge, in a word, is not due to defect, but to destiny and historical  necessity this is a discovery. Conclusions on the deep and final things  are to be reached not by predicating constants but by studying differentiae  and developing the organic logic of differences. The comparative mor  phology of knowledge forms is a domain which Western thought has still  to attack.     If mathematics were a mere science like astronomy or mineralogy, it  would be possible to define their object. This man is not and never has  been able to do. We West-Europeans may put our own scientific notion  of number to perform the same tasks as those with which the mathemati  cians of Athens and Baghdad busied themselves, but the fact remains that  the theme, the intention and the methods of the like-named science in  Athens and in Baghdad were quite different from those of our own. There   ^'im <31&W*   is no mathematic but only mathematics. What we call "the history of  mathematics" implying merely the progressive actualizing of a single   k.. c* /< C " >     232Q Oswald Spengler   invariable ideal is in fact, below the deceptive surface of history, a com  plex of self-contained and independent developments, an ever-repeated  process of bringing to birth new form-worlds and appropriating, trans  forming and sloughing alien form-worlds, a purely organic story of blos  soming, ripening, wilting and dying within the set period. The student  must not let himself be deceived. The mathematic of the Classical soul  sprouted almost out of nothingness, the historically-constituted Western  soul, already possessing the Classical science (not inwardly, but outwardly  as a thing learnt), had to win its own by apparently altering and perfect  ing, but in reality destroying the essentially alien Euclidean system. In the  first case, the agent was Pythagoras, in the second Descartes. In both cases  the act is, at bottom, the same.   The relationship between the form-language of a mathematic and that  of the cognate major arts, 3 is in this way put beyond doubt. The tempera  ment of the thinker and that of the artist differ widely indeed, but the  expression-methods of the waking consciousness are inwardly the same for  each. The sense of form of the sculptor, the painter, the composer is  essentially mathematical in its nature. The same inspired ordering of an  infinite world which manifested itself in the geometrical analysis and  projective geometry of the 17th Century, could vivify, energize, and suf  fuse contemporary music with the harmony that it developed out of the  art of thoroughbass, (which is the geometry of the sound-world) and  contemporary painting with the principle of perspective (the felt geometry  of the space-world that only the West knows). This inspired ordering is  that which Goethe called "The Idea, of which the form is immediately  apprehended in the domain of intuition, whereas pure science does not  apprehend but observes and dissects." The Mathematic goes beyond obser  vation and dissection, and in its highest moments finds the way by vision,  not abstraction. To Goethe again we owe the profound saying: "the  mathematician is only complete in so far as he feels within himself the  beauty of the true." Here we feel how nearly the secret of number is  related to the secret of artistic creation. And so the born mathematician  takes his place by the side of the great masters of the fugue, the chisel and  the brush; he and they alike strive, and must strive, to actualize the grand  order of all things by clothing it in symbol and so to communicate it to  the plain fellow-man who hears that order within himself but cannot  effectively possess it; the domain of number, like the domains of tone,  line and colour, becomes an image of the world-form. For this reason  the word "creative" means more in the mathematical sphere than it does  in the pure sciences Newton, Gauss, and Riemann were artist-natures,  and we know with what suddenness their great conceptions came upon  3 As also those of law and of money     Meaning of Numbers 2321   them. 4 "A mathematician," said old Weierstrass, "who is not at the same  time a bit of a poet will never be a full mathematician,"   The mathematic, then, is an art. As such it has its styles and style-  periods. It is not, as the layman and the philosopher (who is in this matter  a layman too) imagine, substantially unalterable, but subject like every  art to unnoticed changes from epoch to epoch. The development of the  great arts ought never to be treated without an (assuredly not unprofit  able) side-glance at contemporary mathematics. In the very deep relation  between changes of musical theory and the analysis of the infinite, the  details have never yet been investigated, although aesthetics might have  learned a great deal more from these than from all so-called "psychology."  Still more revealing would be a history of musical instruments written,  not (as it always is) from the technical standpoint of tone-production,  but as a study of the deep spiritual bases of the tone-colours and tone-  effects aimed at. For it was the wish, intensified to the point of a longing,  to fill a spatial infinity with sound which produced in contrast to the  Classical lyre and reed (lyra, kithara; aulos, syrinx) and the Arabian lute  the two great families of keyboard instruments (organ, pianoforte, etc.)  and bow instruments, and that as early as the Gothic time. The develop  ment of both these families belongs spiritually (and possibly also in point  of technical origin) to the Celtic-Germanic North lying between Ireland,  the Weser and the Seine. The organ and clavichord belong certainly to  England, the bow instruments reached their definite forms in Upper Italy  between 1480 and 1530, while it was principally in Germany that the  organ was developed into the space-commanding giant that we know, an  instrument the like of which does not exist in all musical history. The free  organ-playing of Bach and his time was nothing if it was not analysis  analysis of a strange and vast tone-world. And, similarly, it is in con  formity with the Western number-thinking, and in opposition to the  Classical, that our string and wind instruments have been developed not  singly but in great groups (strings, woodwind, brass), ordered within  themselves according to the compass of the four human voices; the history  of the modern orchestra, with all its discoveries of new and modification  of old instruments, is in reality the self-contained history of one tone-  world a world, moreover, that is quite capable of being expressed in the  forms of the higher analysis.   4 Poincare", in his Science et Methode (Ch. Ill), searchingly analyses the "becom  ing" of one of his own mathematical discoveries. Each decisive stage in it bears  "les memes caracteres de brievete, de oudainete et de certitude absolue" and in most  cases this "certitude" was such that he merely registered the discovery and put off  its working-out to any convenient season. Tr.     232 2 Oswald Spengter   When, about 540 B.C., the circle of the Pythagoreans arrived at the idea  that number is the essence of all things, it was not "a step in the develop  ment of mathematics" that was made, but a wholly new mathematic that  was born. Long heralded by metaphysical problem-posings and artistic  form-tendencies, now it came forth from the depths of the Classical soul  as a formulated theory, a mathematic born in one act at one great histor  ical moment just as the mathematic of the Egyptians had been, and the  algebra-astronomy of the Babylonian Culture with its ecliptic co-ordinate  system and new for these older mathematics had long been extin  guished and the Egyptian was never written down. Fulfilled by the 2nd  century A.D., the Classical mathematic vanished in its turn (for though it  seemingly exists even to-day, it is only as a convenience of notation that  it does so), and gave place to the Arabian. From what we know of the  Alexandrian mathematic, it is a necessary presumption that there was a  great movement within the Middle East, of which the centre of gravity  must have lain in the Persian-Babylonian schools (such as Edessa, Gundi-  sapora and Ctesiphon) and of which only details found their way into  the regions of Classical speech. In spite of their Greek names, the Alexan  drian mathematicians Zenodorus who dealt with figures of equal perim  eter, Serenus who worked on the properties of a harmonic pencil in space,  Hypsicles who introduced the Chaldean circle-division, Diophantus above  all W ere all without doubt Aramaeans, and their works only a small part  of a literature which was written principally in Syriac. This mathematic  found its completion in the investigations of the Arabian-Islamic thinkers,  and after these there was again a long interval. And then a perfectly new  mathematic was born, the Western, our own, which in our infatuation  we regard as "Mathematics," as the culmination and the implicit purpose  of two thousand years* evolution, though in reality its centuries are  (strictly) numbered and to-day almost spent.   The most valuable thing in the Classical mathematic is its proposition  that number is the essence of all things perceptible to the senses. Defining  number as a measure, it contains the whole world-feeling of a soul pas  sionately devoted to the "here" and the "now," Measurement in this  sense means the measurement of something near and corporeal. Consider  the content of the Classical art-work, say the free-standing statue of a  naked man; here every essential and important element of Being, its  whole rhythm, is exhaustively rendered by surfaces, dimensions and the  sensuous relations of the parts. The Pythagorean notion of the harmony  of numbers, although it was probably deduced from music a music, be  it noted, that knew not polyphony or harmony, and formed its instruments  to render single plump, almost fleshy, tones seems to be the very mould  for a sculpture that has this ideal. The worked stone is only a something  in so far as it has considered limits and measured form; what it is is     Meaning of Numbers 2323   what it has become under the sculptor's chisel. Apart from this it is a  chaos, something not yet actualized, in fact for the time being a null. The  same feeling transferred to the grander stage produces, as an opposite to  the state of chaos, that of cosmos, which for the Classical soul implies a  cleared-up situation of the external world, a harmonic order which in  cludes each separate thing as a well-defined, comprehensible and present  entity. The sum of such things constitutes neither more nor less than the  whole world, and the interspaces between them, which for us are filled  with the impressive symbol of the Universe of Space, are for the  nonent (TO /M) ov) .   Extension means, for Classical mankind body, and for us space, and it  is as a function of space that, to us, things "appear." And, looking back  ward from this standpoint, we may perhaps see into the deepest concept  of the Classical metaphysics, Anaximander's air^ipov a word that is quite  untranslatable into any Western tongue. It is that which possesses no  "number" in the Pythagorean sense of the word, no measurable dimen  sions or definable limits, and therefore no being; the measureless, the  negation of form, the statue not yet carved out of the block; the apxri  optically boundless and formless, which only becomes a something  (namely, the world) after being split up by the senses. It is the underlying  form a priori of Classical cognition, bodiliness as such, which is replaced  exactly in the Kantian world-picture by that Space out of which Kant  maintained that all things could be "thought forth."   We can now understand what it is that divides one mathematic from  another, and in particular the Classical from the Western. The whole  world-feeling of the matured Classical world led it to see mathematics  only as the theory of relations of magnitude, dimension and form between  bodies. When, from out of this feeling, Pythagoras evolved and expressed  the decisive formula, number had come, for him, to be an optical symbol  not a measure of form generally, an abstract relation, but a frontier-post  of the domain of the Become, or rather of that part of it which the senses  were able to split up and pass under review. By the whole Classical world  without exception numbers are conceived as units of measure, as magni  tude, lengths, or surfaces, and for it no other sort of extension is imag  inable. The whole Classical mathematic is at bottom Stereometry (solid  geometry) . To Euclid, who rounded off its system in the third century,  the triangle is of deep necessity the bounding surface of a body, never a  system of three intersecting straight lines or a group of three points in  three-dimensional space. He defines a line as "length without breadth"  (firjKo? airXares). In our mouths such a definition would be pitiful in the  Classical mathematic it was brilliant.   The Western number, too, is not, as Kant and even Helmholtz thought,  something proceeding out of Time as an a priori form of conception, but     Oswald Spengler  2324   is something specifically spatial in that it is an order (or ordering) of like  units. Actual time (as we shall see more and more clearly m the sequel)  has not the slightest relation with mathematical things. Numbers belong  exclusively to the domain of extension. But there are precisely as many  possibilities-and therefore necessities-of ordered presentation of the  extended as there are Cultures. Classical number is a thought-process deal  ing not with spatial relations but with visibly limitable and tangible units,  and it follows naturally and necessarily that the Classical knows only  the "natural 1 ' (positive and whole) numbers, which on the contrary  play in our Western mathematics a quite undistinguished part in the  midst of complex, hypercomplex, non-Archimedean and other number-  systems.   On this account, the idea of irrational numbers the unending decimal  fractions of our notation was unrealizable within the Greek spirit. Euclid  says and he ought to have been better understood that incommensur  able lines are "not related to one another like numbers." In fact, it is the  idea of irrational number that, once achieved, separates the notion of  number from that of magnitude, for the magnitude of such a number  (, for example) can never be defined or exactly represented by any  straight line. Moreover, it follows from this that in considering the rela  tion, say, between diagonal and side in a square the Greek would be  brought up suddenly against a quite other sort of number, which was  fundamentally alien to the Classical soul, and was consequently feared as  a secret of its proper existence too dangerous to be unveiled. There is a  singular and significant late-Greek legend, according to which the man  who first published the hidden mystery of the irrational perished by ship  wreck, "for the unspeakable and the formless must be left hidden for   ever." 5   The fear that underlies this legend is the selfsame notion that prevented  even the ripest Greeks from extending their tiny city-states so as to organ  ize the country-side politically, from laying out their streets to end in  prospects and their alleys to give vistas, that made them recoil time and  again from the Babylonian astronomy with its penetration of endless   5 One may be permitted to add that according to legend, both Hippasus who took  to himself public credit for the discovery of a sphere of twelve pentagons, viz., the  regular dodecahedron (regarded by the Pythagoreans as the quintessence or aether  of a world of real tetrahedrons, octahedrons, icosahedrons and cubes), and Archytas  the eighth successor of the Founder are reputed to have been drowned at sea. The  pentagon from which this dodecahedron is derived, itself involves incommensurable  numbers. The "pentagram** was the recognition badge of Pythagoreans and the a\oyov  (incommensurable) their special secret. It would be noted, too, that Pythagoreanism  was popular till its initiates were found to be dealing in these alarming and subversive  doctrines, and then they were suppressed and lynched a persecution which suggests  more than one deep analogy with certain heresy-suppressions of Western history.  The English student may be referred to G. J. Allman, Greek Geometry from Thales  to Euclid (Cambridge, 1889), and to his articles "Pythagoras," "Philolaus" and  "Archytas" in the Ency.

It is the  deep metaphysical fear that the sense-comprehensible and present in  which the Classical existence had entrenched itself would collapse and  precipitate its cosmos (largely created and sustained by art) into unknown  primitive abysses. And to understand this fear is to understand the final  significance of Classical number that is, measure in contrast to the im  measurable and to grasp the high ethical significance of its limitation.  Goethe too, as a nature-student, felt it hence his almost terrified aversion  to mathematics, which as we can now see was really an involuntary re  action against the non-Classical mathematic, the Infinitesimal Calculus  which underlay the natural philosophy of his time.   Religious feeling in Classical man focused itself ever more and more  intensely upon physical present, localized cults which alone expressed a  college of Euclidean deities. Abstractions, dogmas floating homeless in  the space of thought, were ever alien to it. A cult of this kind has as  much in common with a Roman Catholic dogma as the statue has with  the cathedral organ. There is no doubt that something of cult was com  prised in the Euclidean mathematic consider, for instance, the secret  doctrines of the Pythagoreans and the Theorems of regular polyhedrons  with their esoteric significance in the circle of Plato. Just so, there is a  deep relation between Descartes' analysis of the infinite and contemporary  dogmatic theology as it progressed from the final decisions of the Refor  mation and the Counter-Reformation to entirely desensualized deism.  Descartes and Pascal were mathematicians and Jansenists, Leibniz a  mathematician and pietist. Voltaire, Lagrange and D'Alembert were con  temporaries. Now, the Classical soul felt the principle of the irrational,  which overturned the statuesquely-ordered array of whole numbers and  the complete and self-sufficing world-order for which these stood, as an  impiety against the Divine itself. In Plato's "Timaeus" this feeling is  unmistakable. For the transformation of a series of discrete numbers into  a continuum challenged not merely the Classical notion of number but  the Classical world-idea itself, and so it is understandable that even nega  tive numbers, which to us offer no conceptual difficulty, were impossible  in the Classical mathematic, let alone zero as a number, that refined  creation of a wonderful abstractive power which, for the Indian soul that  conceived it as base for a positional numeration, was nothing more nor  less than the key to the meaning of existence. Negative magnitudes have  no existence. The expression (2) X (3) = +6 is neither something  perceivable nor a representation of magnitude. The series of magnitudes   6 Horace's words (Odes I xi): "Tu ne quaesieris, scire nefas, quern mihi quern tibi  finem di dederint, Leuconoe, nee Babylonios temptaris numeros . . . carpe diem,  quam minimum credula postero" Tr.     _,.. Oswald Spengler   Z325   ends with -hi, and in graphic representation of negative numbers  ( _j>3 4.2 -H 1 2 3) we have suddenly, from zero onwards, posi     tive "symbols of something negative; they mean something, but they no  longer are. But the fulfilment of this act did not lie within the direction  of Classical number-thinking.   Every product of the waking consciousness of the Classical world, then,  is elevated to the rank of actuality by way of sculptural definition. That  which cannot be drawn is not "number." Archytas and Eudoxus use the  terms surface- and volume-numbers to mean what we call second and  third powers, and it is easy to understand that the notion of higher integral  powers did not exist for them, for a fourth power would predicate at once,  for the mind based on the plastic feeling, an extension in four dimensions,  and four material dimensions into the bargain, "which is absurd." Expres  sions like e ijr which we constantly use, or even the fractional index (e.g.,  5 W ) which is employed in the Western . mathematics as early as Oresme  (14th Century), would have been to them utter nonsense. Euclid calls the  factors of a product its sides TrXtvpai and fractions (finite of course) were  treated as whole-number relationships between two lines. Clearly, out of  this no conception of zero as a number could possibly come, for from the  point of view of a draughtsman it is meaningless. We, having minds differ  ently constituted, must not argue from our habits to theirs and treat their  mathematic as a "first stage" in the development of "Mathematics."  Within and for the purpose of the world that Classical man evolved for  himself, the Classical mathematic was a complete thing it is merely not  so for us. Babylonian and Indian mathematics had long contained, as  essential elements of their number-worlds, things which the Classical num  ber-feeling regarded as nonsense and not from ignorance either, since  many a Greek thinker was acquainted with them. It must be repeated,  "Mathematics" is an illusion. A mathematical, and, generally, a scientific  way of thinking is right, convincing, a "necessity of thought," when it  completely expresses the life-feeling proper to it. Otherwise it is either  impossible, futile and senseless, or else, as we in the arrogance of our  historical soul like to say, "primitive." The modern mathematic, though  "true" only for the Western spirit, is undeniably a master-work of that  spirit; and yet to Plato it would have seemed a ridiculous and painful  aberration from the path leading to the "true" to wit, the Classical  mathematic. And so with ourselves. Plainly, we have almost no notion  of the multiude of great ideas belonging to other Cultures that we have  suffered to lapse because our thought with its limitations has not per  mitted us to assimilate them, or (which comes to the same thing) has led  us to reject them as false, superfluous, and nonsensical.     Meaning of Numbers 2327   The Greek mathematic, as a science of perceivable magnitudes, delib  erately confines itself to facts of the comprehensibly present, and limits  its researches and their validity to the near and the small. As compared  with this impeccable consistency, the position of the Western mathematic  is seen to be, practically, somewhat illogical, though it is only since the  discovery of Non-Euclidean Geometry that the fact has been really recog  nized. Numbers are images of the perfectly desensualized understanding,  of pure thought, and contain their abstract validity within themselves.  Their exact application to the actuality of conscious experience is there  fore a problem in itself a problem which is always being posed anew  and never solved and the congruence of mathematical system with  empirical observation is at present anything but self-evident. Although the  lay idea as found in Schopenhauer is that mathematics rest upon the  direct evidences of the senses, Euclidean geometry, superficially identical  though it is with the popular geometry of all ages, is only in agreement  with the phenomenal world approximately and within very narrow limits  in fact, the limits of a drawing-board. Extend these limits, and what  becomes, for instance, of Euclidean parallels? They meet at the line of  the horizon a simple fact upon which all our art-perspective is grounded.   Now, it is unpardonable that Kant, a Western thinker, should have  evaded the mathematic of distance, and appealed to a set of figure-  examples that their mere pettiness excludes from treatment by the specifi  cally Western infinitesimal methods. But Euclid, as a thinker of the  Classical age, was entirely consistent with its spirit when he refrained  from proving the phenomenal truth of his axioms by referring to, say,  the triangle formed by an observer and two infinitely distant fixed stars.  For these can neither be drawn nor "intuitively apprehended" and his  feeling was precisely the feeling which shrank from the irrationals, which  did not dare to give nothingness a value as zero (i.e., a number) and  even in the contemplation of cosmic relations shut its eyes to the Infinite  and held to its symbol of Proportion."   Aristarchus of Samos, who in 288-277 belonged to a circle of astron  omers at Alexandria that doubtless had relations with Chaldaeo-Persian  schools, projected the elements of a heliocentric world-system. 7 Rediscov  ered by Copernicus, it was to shake the metaphysical passions of the West  to their foundations witness Giordano Bruno 8 to become the fulfil  ment of mighty premonitions, and to justify that Faustian, Gothic world-  feeling which had already professed its faith in infinity through the forms   7 In the only writing of his that survives, indeed, Aristarchus maintains the geo  centric view; it may be presumed therefore that it was only temporarily that he let  himself be captivated by a hypothesis of the Chaldaean learning.   8 Giordano Bruno (born 1548, burned for heresy 1600). His whole life might be  expressed as a crusade on behalf of God and the Copernican universe against a  degenerated orthodoxy and an Aristotelian world-idea long coagulated in death. Tr.     Oswald Spengler  2328   of its cathedrals. But the world of Aristarchus received his work with  entire indifference and in a brief space of time it was forgotten-design-  edly, we may surmise. His few followers were nearly all natives of Asia  Minor, his most prominent supporter Seleucus (about 150) being from  the Persian Seleucia on Tigris. In fact, the Aristarchian system had no  spiritual appeal to the Classical Culture and might indeed have become  dangerous to it. And yet it was differentiated from the Copermcan (a  point always missed) by something which made it perfectly comformable  to the Classical world-feeling, viz., the assumption that the cosmos is  contained in a materially finite and optically appreciable hollow sphere,  in the middle of which the planetary system, arranged as such on Coperm  can lines, moved. In the Classical astronomy, the earth and the heavenly  bodies are consistently regarded as entities of two different kinds, how  ever variously their movements in detail might be interpreted. Equally,  the opposite idea that the earth is only a star among stars 9 is not incon  sistent in itself with either the Ptolemaic or the Copernican systems and  in fact was pioneered by Nicolaus Cusanus and Leonardo da Vinci. But  by this device of a celestial sphere the principle of infinity which would  have endangered the sensuous-Classical notion of bounds was smothered.  One would have supposed that the infinity-conception was inevitably  implied by the system of Aristarchus long before his time, the Baby  lonian thinkers had reached it. But no such thought emerges. On the  contrary, in the famous treatise on the grains of sand 10 Archimedes [see  selection, The Sand Reckoner, p. 420. ED.] proves that the filling of this  stereometric body (for that is what Aristarchus's Cosmos is, after all) with  atoms of sand leads to very high, but not to infinite, figure-results. This  proposition, quoted though it may be, time and again, as being a first step  towards the Integral Calculus, amounts to a denial (implicit indeed in the  very title) of everything that we mean by the word analysis. Whereas in  our physics, the constantly-surging hypotheses of a material (i.e., directly  cognizable) <ether, break themselves one after the other against our refusal  to acknowledge material limitations of any kind, Eudoxus, Apollonius and  Archimedes, certainly the keenest and boldest of the Classical mathe  maticians, completely worked out, in the main with rule and compass, a  purely optical analysis of things-become on the basis of sculptural-Classical  bounds. They used deeply-thought-out (and for us hardly understandable)  methods of integration, but these possess only a superficial resemblance  even to Leibniz's definite-integral method. They employed geometrical loci  and co-ordinates, but these are always specified lengths and units of meas  urement and never, as in Fermat and above all in Descartes, unspecified   9 F. Strunz, Gesch. d. Natunviss. im Mittelalter (1910), p. 90.   10 In the "Psammites," or "Arenarius," Archimedes framed a numerical notation  which was to be capable of expressing the number of grains of sand in a sphere of  the size of our universe. Tr.     Meaning of Numbers 2329   spatial relations, values of points in terms of their positions in space. With  these methods also should be classed the exhaustion-method of Archi  medes, 11 given by him in his recently discovered letter to Eratosthenes on  such subjects as the quadrature of the parabola section by means of in  scribed rectangles (instead of through similar polygons). But the very  subtlety and extreme complication of his methods, which are grounded in  certain of Plato's geometrical ideas, make us realize, in spite of superficial  analogies, what an enormous difference separates him from Pascal. Apart  altogether from the idea of Riemann's integral, what sharper contrast could  there be to these ideas than the so-called quadratures of to-day? The name  itself is now no more than an unfortunate survival, the "surface" is indi  cated by a bounding function, and the drawing, as such, has vanished.  Nowhere else did the two mathematical minds approach each other more  closely than in this instance, and nowhere is it more evident that the gulf  between the two souls thus expressing themselves is impassable.   In the cubic style of their early architecture the Egyptians, so to say,  concealed pure numbers, fearful of stumbling upon their secret, and for  the Hellenes too they were the key to the meaning of the become, the  stiffened, the mortal. The stone statue and the scientific system deny life.  Mathematical number, the formal principle of an extension-world of which  the phenomenal existence is only the derivative and servant of waking  human consciousness, bears the hall-mark of causal necessity and so is  linked with death as chronological number is with becoming, with ///e,  with the necessity of destiny. This connexion of strict mathematical form  with the end of organic being, with the phenomenon of its organic re  mainder the corpse, we shall see more and more clearly to be the origin  of all great art. We have already noticed the development of early orna  ment on funerary equipments and receptacles. Numbers are symbols of  the mortal. Stiff forms are the negation of life, formulae and laws spread  rigidity over the face of nature, numbers make dead and the "Mothers"  of Faust II sit enthroned, majestic and withdrawn, in   The realms of Image unconfirmed.  . . .

Math. i.  Klass. Alter. [1912], p. 27).     Oswald Spengler  2330   mined by that spirituality. And so the number-thought and the world-idea  of a Culture are related, and by this relation, the former is elevated above  mere knowledge and experience and becomes a view of the universe, there  being consequently as many mathematics as many number-worlds as  there are higher Cultures. Only so can we understand, as something neces  sary, the fact that the greatest mathematical thinkers, the creative artists  of the realm of numbers, have been brought to the decisive mathematical  discoveries of their several Cultures by a deep religious intuition.   Classical, Apollinian number we must regard as the creation of Pythag  oras wfo founded a religion. It was an instinct that guided Nicolaus  Cusanus, the great Bishop of Brixen (about 1450), from the idea of  the unendingness of God in nature to the elements of the Infinitesimal  Calculus. Leibniz himself, who two centuries later definitely settled the  methods and notation of the Calculus, was led by purely metaphysical  speculations about the divine principle and its relation to infinite extent  to conceive and develop the notion of an analysis situs probably the most  inspired of all interpretations of pure and emancipated space the possi  bilities of which were to be developed later by Grassmann in his Ausdeh-  nungslehre and above all by Riemann, their real creator, in his symbolism  of two-sided planes representative of the nature of equations. And Kepler  and Newton, strictly religious natures both, were and remained convinced,  like Plato, that it was precisely through the medium of number that they  had been able to apprehend intuitively the essence of the divine world-  order.     The Classical arithmetic, we are always told, was first liberated from its  sense-bondage, widened and extended by Diophantus, who did not indeed  create algebra (the science of undefined magnitudes) but brought it to ex  pression within the framework of the Classical mathematic that we know  and so suddenly that we have to assume that there was a pre-existent  stock of ideas which he worked out. But this amounts, not to an enrich  ment of, but a complete victory over, the Classical world-feeling, and the  mere fact should have sufficed in itself to show that, inwardly, Diophantus  does not belong to the Classical Culture at all. What is active in him is a  new number-feeling, or let us say a new limit-feeling with respect to the  actual and become, and no longer that Hellenic feeling of sensuously-  present limits which had produced the Euclidean geometry, the nude statue  and the coin. Details of the formation of this new mathematic we do not  know Diophantus stands so completely by himself in the history of so-  called late-Classical mathematics that an Indian influence has been pre  sumed. But here also the influence must really have been that of those  early- Arabian schools whose studies (apart from the dogmatic) have     Meaning of Numbers 2331   hitherto been so imperfectly investigated. In Diophantus, unconscious  though he may be of his own essential antagonism to the Classical founda  tions on which he attempted to build, there emerges from under the  surface of Euclidean intention the new limit-feeling which I designate the  "Magian." He did not widen the idea of number as magnitude, but (un  wittingly) eliminated it. No Greek could have stated anything about an  undefined number a or an undenominated number 3 which are neither  magnitudes nor lines whereas the new limit-feeling sensibly expressed by  numbers of this sort at least underlay, if it did not constitute, Diophantine  treatment; and the letter-notation which we employ to clothe our own  (again transvalued) algebra was first introduced by Vieta in 1591, an un  mistakable, if unintended, protest against the classicizing tendency of  Renaissance mathematics.   Diophantus lived about 250 A.D., that is, in the third century of that  Arabian Culture whose organic history, till now smothered under the  surface-forms of the Roman Empire and the "Middle Ages," comprises  everything that happened after the beginning of our era in the region that  was later to be Islam's. It was precisely in the time of Diophantus that the  last shadow of the Attic statuary art paled before the new space-sense of  cupola, mosaic and sarcophagus-relief that we have in the Early-Christian-  Syrian style. In that time there was once more archaic art and strictly  geometrical ornament; and at that time too Diocletian completed the trans  formation of the now merely sham Empire into a Caliphate. The four  centuries that separate Euclid and Diophantus, separate also Plato and  Plotinus the last and conclusive thinker, the Kant, of a fulfilled Culture  and the first schoolman, the Duns Scotus, of a Culture just awakened.   It is here that we are made aware for the first time of the existence of  those higher individualities whose coming, growth and decay constitute  the real substance of history underlying the myriad colours and changes  of the surface. The Classical spirituality, which reached its final phase in  the cold intelligence of the Romans and of which the whole Classical Cul  ture with all its works, thoughts, deeds and ruins forms the "body," had  been born about 1100 B.C. in the country about the ^Egean Sea. The  Arabian Culture, which, under cover of the Classical Civilization, had  been germinating in the East since Augustus, came wholly out of the  region between Armenia and Southern Arabia, Alexandria and Ctesiphon,  and we have to consider as expressions of this new soul almost the whole  "late-Classical" art of the Empire, all the young ardent religions of the  East Mandaeanism, Manichaeism, Christianity, Neo-Platonism, and in  Rome itself, as well as the Imperial Fora, that Pantheon which is the first  of all mosques.   That Alexandria and Antioch still wrote in Greek and imagined that  they were thinking in Greek is a fact of no more importance than the     Oswald Spengler  2332   facts that Latin was the scientific language of the West right up to the  time of Kant and that Charlemagne "renewed" the Roman Empire.   In Diophantus, number has ceased to be the measure and essence of  plastic things. In the Ravennate mosaics man has ceased to be a body.  Unnoticed, Greek designations have lost their original connotations. We  have left the realm of Attic K <&o K *yadia the Stoic arapa^ia and 7 a\^.  Diophantus does not yet know zero and negative numbers, it is true, but  he has ceased to know Pythagorean numbers. And this Arabian indeter-  minateness of number is, in its turn, something quite different from the  controlled variability of the later Western mathematics, the variability of   the function.   The Magian mathematic we can see the outline, though we are igno  rant of the details advanced through Diophantus (who is obviously not  a starting-point) boldly and logically to a culmination in the Abbassid  period (9th century) that we can appreciate in Al-Khwarizmi and Al-  sidzshi. And as Euclidean geometry is to Attic statuary (the same expres  sion-form in a different medium) and the analysis of space to polyphonic  music, so this algebra is to the Magian art with its mosaic, its arabesque  (which the Sassanid Empire and later Byzantium produced with an ever-  increasing profusion and luxury of tangible-intangible organic motives)  and its Constantinian high-relief in which uncertain deep-darks divide the  freely-handled figures of the foreground. As algebra is to Classical arith  metic and Western analysis, so is the cupola-church to the Doric temple  and the Gothic cathedral. It is not as though Diophantus were one of the  great mathematicians. On the contrary, much of what we have been accus  tomed to associate with his name is not his work alone. His accidental  importance lies in the fact that, so far as our knowledge goes, he was the  first mathematician in whom the new number-feeling is unmistakably  present. In comparison with the masters who conclude the development of  a mathematic with Apollonius and Archimedes, with Gauss, Cauchy,  Riemann Diophantus has, in his form-language especially, something  primitive. This something, which till now we have been pleased to refer  to 'late-Classical" decadence, we shall presently learn to understand and  value, just as we are revising our ideas as to the despised "late-Classical"  art and beginning to see in it the tentative expression of the nascent Early  Arabian Culture. Similarly archaic, primitive, and groping was the mathe  matic of Nicolas Oresme, Bishop of Liseux (1323-1382), 12 who was the  first Western who used co-ordinates so to say elastically 13 and, more im  portant still, to employ fractional powers both of which presuppose a   12 Oresme was, equally, prelate, church reformer, scholar, scientist and economist  the very type of the philosopher-leader. Tr.   13 Oresme in his Latitudines Formarum used ordinate and abscissa, not indeed to  specify numerically, but certainly to describe, change, i.e., fundamentally, to express  functions. Tr.     Meaning of Numbers 2333   number-feeling, obscure it may be but quite unmistakable, which is com  pletely non-Classical and also non-Arabic. But if, further, we think of  Diophantus together with the early-Christian sarcophagi of the Roman  collections, and of Oresme together with the Gothic wall-statuary of the  German cathedrals, we see that the mathematicians as well as the artists  have something in common, which is, that they stand in their respective  Cultures at the same (viz., the primitive) level of abstract understanding.  In the world and age of Diophantus the stereometric sense of bounds,  which had long ago reached in Archimedes the last stages of refinement  and elegance proper to the megalopolitan intelligence, had passed away.  Throughout that world men were unclear, longing, mystic, and no longer  bright and free in the Attic way; they were men rooted in the earth of a  young country-side, not megalopolitans like Euclid and D'Alembert. They  no longer understood the deep and complicated forms of the Classical  thought, and their own were confused and new, far as yet from urban  clarity and tidiness. Their Culture was in the Gothic condition, as all Cul  tures have been in their youth as even the Classical was in the early  Doric period which is known to us now only by its Dipylon pottery. Only  in Baghdad and in the 9th and 10th Centuries were the young ideas of the  age of Diophantus carried through to completion by ripe masters of the  calibre of Plato and Gauss.     The decisive act of Descartes, whose geometry appeared in 1637, con  sisted not in the introduction of a new method or idea in the domain of  traditional geometry (as we are so frequently told), but in the definitive  conception of a new number-idea, which conception was expressed in the  emancipation of geometry from servitude to optically-realizable construc  tions and to measured and measurable lines generally. With that, the anal  ysis of the infinite became a fact. The rigid, so-called Cartesian, system  of co-ordinates a semi-Euclidean method of ideally representing meas  urable magnitudes had long been known (witness Oresme) and regarded  as of high importance, and when we get to the bottom of Descartes*  thought we find that what he did was not to round off the system but to  overcome it. Its last historic representative was Descartes' contemporary  Fermat.   In place of the sensuous element of concrete lines and planes the spe  cific character of the Classical feeling of bounds there emerged the  abstract, spatial, un-Classical element of the point which from then on was  regarded as a group of co-ordered pure numbers. The idea of magnitude  and of perceivable dimension derived from Classical texts and Arabian  traditions was destroyed and replaced by that of variable relation-values  between positions in space. It is not in general realized that this amounted     Oswald Spengter  2334   to the supersession of geometry, which thenceforward enjoyed only a  fictitious existence behind a f agade of Classical tradition. The word 'geom  etry" has an inextensible Apollinian meaning, and from the time of Des  cartes what is called the "new geometry" is made up in part of synthetic  work upon the position of points in a space which is no longer necessarily  three-dimensional (a "manifold of points"), and in part of analysis, m  which numbers are denned through point-positions in space. And this re  placement of lengths by positions carries with it a purely spatial, and no  longer a material, conception of extension.   The clearest example of this destruction of the inherited optical-finite  geometry seems to me to be the conversion of angular functions which  in the Indian mathematic had been numbers (in a sense of the word that  is hardly accessible to our minds) into periodic functions, and their  passage thence into an infinite number-realm, in which they become series  and not the smallest trace remains of the Euclidean figure. In all parts of  that realm the circle-number IT, like the Napierian base , generates rela  tions of all sorts which obliterate all the old distinctions of geometry,  trigonometry and algebra, which are neither arithmetical nor geometrical  in their nature, and in which no one any longer dreams of actually draw  ing circles or working out powers.     At the moment exactly corresponding to that at which (c. 540) the  Classical Soul in the person of Pythagoras discovered its own proper  Apollinian number, the measurable magnitude, the Western soul in the  persons of Descartes and his generation (Pascal, Fermat, Desargues) dis  covered a notion of number that was the child of a passionate Faustian  tendency towards the infinite. Number as pure magnitude inherent in the  material presentness of things is paralleled by numbers as pure relation,^  and if we may characterize the Classical "world," the cosmos, as being  based on a deep need of visible limits and composed accordingly as a sum  of material things, so we may say that our world-picture is an actualizing  of an infinite space in which things visible appear very nearly as realities  of a lower order, limited in the presence of the illimitable. The symbol  of the West is an idea of which no other Culture gives even a hint, the  idea of Function. The function is anything rather than an expansion of,  it is complete emancipation from, any pre-existent idea of number. With  the function, not only the Euclidean geometry (and with it the common  human geometry of children and laymen, based on everyday experience)  but also the Archimedean arithmetic, ceased to have any value for the  really significant mathematic of Western Europe. Henceforward, this con-   14 Similarly, coinage and double-entry book-keeping play analogous parts in the  noney-thinking of the Classical and the Western Cultures respectively.     Meaning of Numbers 2335   sisted solely in abstract analysis. For classical man geometry and arith  metic were self-contained and complete sciences of the highest rank, both  phenomenal and both concerned with magnitudes that could be drawn or  numbered. For us, on the contrary, those things are only practical auxili-  aries"bf daily life. Addition and multiplication, the two Classical methods  of reckoning magnitudes, have, like their sister geometrical-drawing,  utterly vanished in the infinity of functional processes. Even the power,  which in the beginning denotes numerically a set of multiplications (pro  ducts of equal magnitudes), is, through the exponential idea (logarithm)  and its employment in complex, negative and fractional forms, dissoci  ated from all connexion with magnitude and transferred to a transcendent  relational world which the Greeks, knowing only the two positive whole-  number powers that represent areas and volumes, were unable to ap-   i   proach. Think, for instance, of expressions like -', \/x~, <*> .   Every one of the significant creations which succeded one another so  rapidly from the Renaissance onward imaginary and complex numbers,  introduced by Cardanus as early as 1550; infinite series, established theo  retically by Newton's great discovery of the binomial theorem in 1666; the  differential geometry, the definite integral of Leibniz; the aggregate as a  new number-unit, hinted at even by Descartes; new processes like those of  general integrals; the expansion of functions into series and even into in  finite series of other functions is a victory over the popular and sensuous  number-feeling in us, a victory which the new mathematic had to win in  order to make the new world-feeling actual.   In all history, so far, there is no second example of one Culture paying  to another Culture long extinguished such reverence and submission in  matters of science as ours has paid to the Classical. It was very long  before we found courage to think our proper thought. But though the wish  to emulate the Classical was constantly present, every step of the attempt  took us in reality further away from the imagined ideal. The history of  Western knowledge is thus one of progressive emancipation from Classical  thought, an emancipation never willed but enforced in the depths of the  unconscious. And so the development of the new mathematic consists of  a long, secret and finally victorious battle against the notion of magnitude.     One result of this Classicizing tendency has been to prevent us from  finding the new notation proper to our Western number as such. The  present-day sign-language of mathematics perverts its real content. It is  principally owing to that tendency that the belief in numbers as magni  tudes still rules to-day even amongst mathematicians, for is it not the  base of all our written notation?     _ ., Oswald Spengler   ZJ5O   But it is not the separate signs (e.g., *, ?r, 5) serving to express the func  tions but the function itself as unit, as element, the variable relation no  longer capable of being optically defined, that constitutes the new number;  and this new number should have demanded a new notation built up with  entire disregard of Classical influences. Consider the difference between  two equations (if the same word can be used of two such dissimilar things)  such as 3 X -h 4 X = 5 J and x n -f y n = z n (the equation of Fermat's theorem) .  The first consists of several Classical numbers i.e., magnitudes but the  second is one number of a different sort, veiled by being written down ac  cording to Euclidean-Archimedean tradition in the identical form of the  first. In the first case, the sign = establishes a rigid connexion between  definite and tangible magnitudes, but in the second it states that within  a domain of variable images there exists a relation such that from certain  alterations certain other alterations necessarily follow. The first equation  has as its aim the specification by measurement of a concrete magnitude,  viz., a "result," while the second has, in general, no result but is simply the  picture and sign of a relation which for n > 2 (this is the famous Fermat  problem 15 ) can probably be shown to exclude integers. A Greek mathe  matician would have found it quite impossible to understand the purport  of an operation like this, which was not meant to be "worked out."   As applied to the letters in Fermat's equation, the notion of the un  known is completely misleading. In the first equation x is a magnitude,  defined and measurable, which it is our business to compute. In the second,  the word "defined" has no meaning at all for x, v, z, n, and consequently  we do not attempt to compute their "values." Hence they are not numbers  at all in the plastic sense but signs representing a connexion that is desti  tute of the hallmarks of magnitude, shape and unique meaning, an infinity  of possible positions of like character, an ensemble unified and so attain  ing existence as a number. The whole equation, though written in our  unfortunate notation as a plurality of terms, is actually one single number,  x, y, z being no more numbers than -f and = are.   In fact, directly the essentially anti-Hellenic idea of the irrationals is  introduced, the foundations of the idea of number as concrete and definite  collapse. Thenceforward, the series of such numbers is no longer a visible  row of increasing, discrete, numbers capable of plastic embodiment but a  unidimensional continuum in which each "cut" (in Dedekind's sense)  represents a number. Such a number is already difficult to reconcile with  Classical number, for the Classical mathematic knows only one number  between 1 and 3, whereas for the Western the totality of such numbers  is an infinite aggregate. But when we introduce further the imaginary   15 That is, "it is impossible to part a cube into two cubes, a biquadrate into two  biquadrates, and generally any power above the square into two powers having the  same exponent." Fermat claimed to possess a proof of the proposition, but this has  not been preserved, and no general proof has hitherto been obtained. Tr.     Meaning of Numbers 2337   (\/ 1 or /) and finally the complex numbers (general form a -f hi), the  linear continuum is broadened into the highly transcendent form of a  number-body, i.e., the content of an aggregate of homogeneous elements  in which a "cut" now stands for a number-surface containing an infinite  aggregate of numbers of a lower "potency" (for instance, all the real num  bers), and there remains not a trace of number in the Classical and popu  lar sense. These number-surfaces, which since Cauchy and Riemann have  played an important part in the theory of functions, are pure thought-  pictures. Even positive irrational number (e.g., \/2) could be conceived  in a sort of negative fashion by Classical minds; they had, in fact, enough  idea of it to ban it as app^ros and aXoyos. But expressions of the form  x 4- yi lie beyond every possibility of comprehension by Classical thought,  whereas it is on the extension of the mathematical laws over the whole  region of the complex numbers, within which these laws remain operative,  that we have built up the function theory which has at last exhibited the  Western mathematic in all purity and unity. Not until that point was  reached could this mathematic be unreservedly brought to bear in the  parallel sphere of our dynamic Western physics; for the Classical mathe  matic was fitted precisely to its own stereometric world of individual  objects and to static mechanics as developed from Leucippus to Archi  medes.   The brilliant period of the Baroque mathematic the counterpart of the  Ionian lies substantially in the 18th Century and extends from the de  cisive discoveries of Newton and Leibniz through Euler, Lagrange, La  place and D'Alembert to Gauss. Once this immense creation found wings,  its rise was miraculous. Men hardly dared believe their senses. The age of  refined scepticism witnessed the emergence of one seemingly impossible  truth after another. Regarding the theory of the differential coefficient,  D'Alembert had to say: "Go forward, and faith will come to you." Logic  itself seemed to raise objections and to prove foundations fallacious. But  the goal was reached.   This century was a very carnival of abstract and immaterial thinking,  in which the great masters of analysis and, with them, Bach, Gluck, Haydn  and Mozart a small group of rare and deep intellects revelled in the  most refined discoveries and speculations, from which Goethe and Kant  remained aloof; and in point of content it is exactly paralleled by the ripest  century of the Ionic, the century of Eudoxus and Archytas (440-350)  and, we may add, of Phidias, Polycletus, Alcamenes and the Acropolis  buildings in which the form-world of Classical mathematic and sculp  ture displayed the whole fullness of its possibilities, and so ended.   And now for the first time it is possible to comprehend in full the ele  mental opposition of the Classical and the Western souls. In the whole  panorama of history, innumerable and intense as historical relations are,     233g Oswald Spenglcr   we find no two things so fundamentally alien to one another as these.  And it is because extremes meet because it may be there is some deep  common origin behind their divergence- that we find in the Western  Faustian soul this yearning effort towards the Apollinian ideal, the only  alien ideal which we have loved and, for its power of intensely living in  the pure sensuous present, have envied.     To return to mathematics. In the Classical world the starting-point of  every formative act was, as we have seen, the ordering of the "become,"  in so far as this was present, visible, measurable and numerable. The  Western, Gothic, form-feeling on the contrary is that of an unrestrained,  strong-willed far-ranging soul, and its chosen badge is pure, imperceptible,  unlimited space. But we must not be led into regarding such symbols as  unconditional. On the contrary, they are strictly conditional, though apt  to be taken as having identical essence and validity. Our universe of infi  nite space, whose existence, for us, goes without saying, simply does not  exist for Classical man. It is not even capable of being presented to him.  On the other hand, the Hellenic cosmos, which is (as we might have dis  covered long ago) entirely foreign to our way of thinking, was for the  Hellene something self-evident. The fact is that the infinite space of our  physics is a form of very numerous and extremely complicated elements  tactitly assumed, which have come into being only as the copy and ex  pression of our soul, and are actual, necessary and natural only for our  type of waking life. The simple notions are always the most difficult. They  are simple, in that they comprise a vast deal that not only is incapable of  being exhibited in words but does not even need to be stated, because for  men of the particular group it is anchored in the intuition; and they are  difficult because for all alien men their real content is ipso facto quite  inaccessible. Such a notion, at once simple and difficult, is our specifically  Western meaning of the word "space." The whole of our mathematic from  Descartes onward is devoted to the theoretical interpretation of this great  and wholly religious symbol. The aim of all our physics since Galileo is  identical; but in the Classical mathematics and physics the content of this  word is simply not known.   Here, too, Classical names, inherited from the literature of Greece and  retained in use, have veiled the realities. Geometry means the art of meas  uring, arithmetic the art of numbering. The mathematic of the West has  long ceased to have anything to do with both these forms of defining, but  it has not managed to find new names for its own elements for the word  "analysis" is hopelessly inadequate.   The beginning and end of the Classical mathematic is consideration of  the properties of individual bodies and their boundary-surfaces; thus in-     Meaning of Numbers 2339   directly taking in conic sections and higher curves. We, on the other hand,  at bottom know only the abstract space-element of the point, which can  neither be seen, nor measured, nor yet named, but represents simply a  centre of reference. The straight line, for the Greeks a measurable edge,  is for us an infinite continuum of points. Leibniz illustrates his infinitesi  mal principle by presenting the straight line as one limiting case and the  point as the other limiting case of a circle having infinitely great or in  finitely little radius. But for the Greek the circle is a plane and the problem  that interested him was that of bringing it into a commensurable condi  tion. Thus the squaring of the circle became for the Classical intellect the  supreme problem of the finite. The deepest problem of world-form seemed  to it to be to alter surfaces bounded by curved lines, without change of  magnitude, into rectangles and so to render them measurable. For us, on  the other hand, it has become the usual, and not specifically significant,  practice to represent the number TT by algebraic means, regardless of any  geometrical image.   .The Classical mathematician knows only what he sees and grasps. Where  definite and defining visibility the domain of his thought ceases, his  science comes to an end. The Western mathematician, as soon as he has  quite shaken off the trammels of Classical prejudice, goes off into a wholly  abstract region of infinitely numerous "manifolds" of n (no longer 3)  dimensions, in which his so-called geometry always can and generally must  do without every commonplace aid. When Classical man turns to artistic  expressions of his form-feeling, he tries with marble and bronze to give  the dancing or the wrestling human form that pose and attitude in which  surfaces and contours have all attainable proportion and meaning. But  the true artist of the West shuts his eyes and loses himself in the realm of  bodiless music, in which harmony and polyphony bring him to images of  utter "beyondness" that transcend all possibilities of visual definition. One  need only think of the meanings of the word "figure" as used respectively  by the Greek sculptor and the Northern contrapuntist, and the opposition  of the two worlds, the two mathematics, is immediately presented. The  Greek mathematicians ever use the word a-apa for their entities, just as  the Greek lawyers used it for persons as distinct from things (o-^ftara *eu  Trpay/iara: personce et res).   Classical number, integral and corporeal, therefore inevitably seeks to  relate itself with the birth of bodily man, the o-w/Lta. The number 1 is  hardly yet conceived of as actual number but rather as apxn> ti 16 prime  stuff of the number-series, the origin of all true numbers and therefore all  magnitudes, measures and materiality (Dinglichkeit). In the group of the  Pythagoreans (the date does not matter) its figured-sign was also the sym  bol of the mother-womb, the origin of all life. The digit 2, the first true  number, which doubles the 1, was therefore correlated with the male prin-     Oswald Spengler  2340   ciple and given the sign of the phallus. And, finally, 3, the "holy number"  of the Pythagoreans, denoted the act of union between man and woman,  the act of propagation-the erotic suggestion in adding and multiplying  (the only two processes of increasing, of propagating, magnitude useful to  Classical man) is easily seen and its sign was the combination of the two  first Now, all this throws quite a new light upon the legends previously  alluded to, concerning the sacrilege of disclosing the irrational. The irra  tionalin our language the employment of unending decimal fractions-  implied the destruction of an organic and corporeal and reproductive order  that the gods had laid down. There is no doubt that the Pythagorean re  forms of the Classical religion were themselves based upon the immemorial  Demeter-cult. Demeter, Gaea, is akin to Mother Earth. There is a deep  relation between the honour paid to her and this exalted conception of   the numbers.   Thus, inevitably, the Classical became by degrees the Culture of the  small. The Apollinian soul had tried to tie down the meaning of things-  become by means of the principle of visible limits; its taboo was focused  upon the immediately-present and proximate alien. What was far away,  invisible, was ipso facto "not there." The Greek and the Roman alike sacri  ficed to the gods of the place in which he happened to stay or reside; all  other deities were outside the range of vision. Just as the Greek tongue  again and again we shall note the mighty symbolism of such language-  phenomenapossessed no word for space, so the Greek himself was des  titute of our feeling of landscape, horizons, outlooks, distances, clouds,  and of the idea of the far-spread fatherland embracing the great nation.  Home, for Classical man, is what he can see from the citadel of his native  town and no more. All that lay beyond the visual range of this political  atom was alien, and hostile to boot; beyond that narrow range, fear set in  at once, and hence the appalling bitterness with which these petty towns  strove to destroy one another. The Polis is the smallest of all conceivable  state-forms, and its policy is frankly short-range, therein differing in the  extreme from our own cabinet-diplomacy which is the policy of the un  limited. Similarly, the Classical temple, which can be taken in in one  glance, is the smallest of all first-rate architectural forms. Classical geom  etry from Archytas to Euclid like the school geometry of to-day which  is still dominated by it concerned itself with small, manageable figures  and bodies, and therefore remained unaware of the difficulties that arise  in establishing figures of astronomical dimensions, which in many cases  are not amenable to Euclidean geometry. 16 Otherwise the subtle Attic   16 A beginning is now being made with the application of non-Euclidean geometries  to astronomy. The hypothesis of curved space, closed but without limits, filled by the  system of fixed stars on a radius of about 470,000,000 earth-distances, would lead to  the hypothesis of a counter-image of the sun which to us appears as a star of medium  brilliancy.     Meaning of Numbers 2341   spirit would almost surely have arrived at some notion of the problems of  non-Euclidean geometry, for its criticism of the well-known "parallel"  axiom, 17 the doubtfulness of which soon aroused opposition yet could not  in any way be elucidated, brought it very close indeed to the decisive dis  covery. The Classical mind as unquestioningly devoted and limited itself  to the study of the small and the near as ours has to that of the infinite  and ultra-visual. All the mathematical ideas that the West found for itself  or borrowed from others were automatically subjected to the form-lan  guage of the Infinitesimal and that long before the actual Differential  Calculus was discovered. Arabian algebra, Indian trigonometry, Classical  mechanics were incorporated as a matter of course in analysis. Even the  most "self-evident" propositions of elementary arithmetic such as 2 X 2 =  4 become, when considered analytically, problems, and the solution of  these problems was only made possible by deductions from the Theory  of Aggregates, and is in many points still unaccomplished. Plato and his  age would have looked upon this sort of thing not only as a hallucination  but also as evidence of an utterly nonmathematical mind. In a certain  measure, geometry may be treated algebraically and algebra geometrically,  that is, the eye may be switched off or it may be allowed to govern. We  take the first alternative, the Greeks the second. Archimedes, in his beau  tiful management of spirals, touches upon certain general facts that are  also fundamentals in Leibniz's method of the definite integral; but his  processes, for all their superficial appearance of modernity, are subordi  nated to stereometric principles; in like case, an Indian mathematician  would naturally have found some trigonometrical formulation. 18     From this fundamental opposition of Classical and Western numbers  there arises an equally radical difference in the relationship of element to  element in each of these number-worlds. The nexus of magnitudes is called  proportion , that of relations is comprised in the notion of function. The  significance of these two words is not confined to mathematics proper;  they are of high importance also in the allied arts of sculpture and music.  Quite apart from the role of proportion in ordering the parts of the indi  vidual statue, the typically Classical art-forms of the statue, the relief, and  the fresco, admit enlargements and reductions of scale words that in  music have no meaning at all as we see in the art of the gems, in which  the subjects are essentially reductions from life-sized originals. In the do  main of Function, on the contrary, it is the idea of transformation of  groups that is of decisive importance, and the musician will readily agree   17 That only one parallel to a given straight line is possible through a given point  a proposition that is incapable of proof.   18 It is impossible to say, with certainty, how much of the Indian mathematics that  we possess is old, i.e., before Buddha.     Oswald Spengler  2342     that similar ideas play an essential part in modern   need only allude to one of the most elegant orchestral forms of the   Century, the Tema con Variazioni. m   All proportion assumes the constancy, all transformation the van ability  of the constituents. Compare, for instance, the congruence theorems of  Euclid the proof of which depends in fact on the assumed ratio 1 : 1, with  the modern deduction of the same by means of angular functions.  *****   The Alpha and Omega of the Classical mathematic is construction  (which in the broad sense includes elementary arithmetic), that is, the  production of a single visually-present figure. The chisel, in this second  sculptural art, is the compass. On the other hand, in function-research  where the object is not a result of the magnitude sort but a discussion of  general formal possibilities, the way of working is best described as a sort  of composition-procedure closely analogous to the musical; and in fact, a  great number of the ideas met with in the theory of music (key, phrasing,  chromatics, for instance) can be directly employed in physics, and it is at  least arguable that many relations would be clarified by so doing.   Every construction affirms, and every operation denies appearances, m  that the one works out that which is optically given and the other dissolves  it. And so we meet with yet another contrast between the two kinds of  mathematic; the Classical mathematic of small things deals with the con  crete individual instance and produces a once-for-all construction, while  the mathematic of the infinite handles whole classes of formal possibilities,  groups of functions, operations, equations, curves, and does so with an  eye, not to any result they may have, but to their course. And so for the  last two centuries though present-day mathematicians hardly realize the  f act _there has been growing up the idea of a general morphology of  mathematical operations, which we are justified in regarding as the real  meaning of modern mathematics as a whole. All this, as we shall perceive  more and more clearly, is one of the manifestations of a general tendency  inherent in the Western intellect, proper to the Faustian spirit and Culture  and found in no other. The great majority of the problems which occupy  our mathematic, and are regarded as "our" problems in the same sense as  the squaring of the circle was the Greeks', e.g., the investigation of con  vergence in infinite series (Cauchy) and the transformation of elliptic and  algebraic integrals into multiply-periodic functions (Abel, Gauss) would  probably have seemed to the Ancients, who strove for simple and definite  quantitative results, to be an exhibition of rather abstruse virtuosity. And  so indeed the popular mind regards them even to-day. There is nothing  less "popular" than the modern mathematic, and it too contains its sym  bolism of the infinitely far, of distance. All the great works of the West,     Meaning of Numbers 2343   from the "Divina Commedia" to "Parsifal," are unpopular, whereas every  thing Classical from Homer to the Altar of Pergamum was popular in the  highest degree.     Thus, finally, the whole content of Western number-thought centres  itself upon the historic limit-problem of the Faustian mathematic, the key  which opens the way to the Infinite, that Faustian infinite which is so dif  ferent from the infinity of Arabian and Indian world-ideas. Whatever the  guise infinite series, curves or functions in which number appears in  the particular case, the essence of it is the theory of the limit. This limit is  the absolute opposite of the limit which (without being so called) figures  in the Classical problem of the quadrature of the circle. Right into the  18th Century, Euclidean popular prepossessions obscured the real mean  ing of the differential principle. The idea of infinitely small quantities lay,  so to say, ready to hand, and however skilfully they were handled, there  was bound to remain a trace of the Classical constancy, the semblance of  magnitude, about them, though Euclid would never have known them or  admitted them as such. Thus, zero is a constant, a whole number in the  linear continuum between +1 and 1; and it was a great hindrance to  Euler in his analytical researches that, like many after him, he treated the  differentials as zero. Only in the 19th Century was this relic of Classical  number-feeling finally removed and the Infinitesimal Calculus made logi  cally secure by Cauchy's definitive elucidation of the limit-ideal only the  intellectual step from the "infinitely small quantity" to the "lower limit of  every possible finite magnitude" brought out the conception of a variable  number which oscillates beneath any assignable number that is not zero.  A number of this sort has ceased to possess any character of magnitude  whatever: the limit, as thus finally presented by theory, is no longer that  which is approximated to, but the approximation, the process, the opera  tion itself. It is not a state, but a relation. And so in this decisive problem  of our mathematic, we are suddenly made to see how historical is the con  stitution of the Western soul.     The liberation of geometry from the visual, and of algebra from the  notion of magnitude, and the union of both, beyond all elementary limita  tions of drawing and counting, in the great structure of function-theory  this was the grand course of Western number-thought. The constant num  ber of the Classical mathematic was dissolved into the variable. Geometry  became analytical and dissolved all concrete forms, replacing the mathe  matical bodies from which the rigid geometrical values had been obtained,  by abstract spatial relations which in the end ceased to have any applica-     Oswald Spcngler  2344   tion at all to sense-present phenomena. It began by substituting for     Tected coordinate system should not be changed. But these co-ordinates  immediately came to be regarded as values pure and simple, serving not so  much to determine as to represent and replace the pos.tion of points as  space-elements. Number, the boundary of things-become, was represented,  rTt as before pictorically fay a figure, but symbolically by an equation.  "Geometry" altered its meaning; the co-ordinate system as a picturing dis  appeared and the point became an entirely abstract number-group. In  architecture, we find this inward transformation of Renaissance mo  Baroque through the innovations of Michael Angelo and Vignola. Visually  pure lines became, in palace and church fa ? ades as in mathemafccs, in  effectual. In place of the clear co-ordinates that we have in Romano-  Florentine colonnading and storeying, the "infinitesimal" appears in the  graceful flow of elements, the scrollwork, the cartouches. The constructive  dissolves in the wealth of the decorative-in mathematical language, the  functional. Columns and pilasters, assembled in groups and clusters, break  up the facades, gather and disperse again restlessly. The flat surfaces of  wall roof storey melt into a wealth of stucco work and ornaments, vanish  and break into a play of light and shade. The light itself, as it is made to  play upon the form-world of mature Baroque viz., the period from Ber  nini (1650) to the Rococo of Dresden, Vienna and Paris has become an  essentially musical element. The Dresden Zwinger" is a sinfonia. Along  with 18th Century mathematics, 18th Century architecture develops into  a form-world of musical characters.   *****   This mathematics of ours was bound in due course to reach the point  at which not merely the limits of artificial geometrical form but the limits  of the visual itself were felt by theory and by the soul alike as limits in  deed, as obstacles to the unreserved expression of inward possibilities in  other words, the point at which the ideal of transcendent extension came  into fundamental conflict with the limitations of immediate perception. The  Classical soul, with the entire abdication of Platonic and Stoic irapafia.,  submitted to the sensuous and (as the erotic under-meaning of the Pythag  orean numbers shows) it rather felt than emitted its great symbols. Of  transcending the corporeal here-and-now it was quite incapable. But  whereas number, as conceived by a Pythagorean, exhibited the essence of  individual and discrete data in "Nature" Descartes and his successors   "Built for August II, in 1711, as barbican or fore-building for a projected palace.  Tr.     Meaning of Numbers 2345   looked upon number as something to be conquered, to be wrung out, an  abstract relation royally indifferent to all phenomenal support and capable  of holding its own against "Nature" on all occasions. The will-to-power  (to use Nietzsche's great formula) that from the earliest Gothic of the  Eddas, the Cathedrals and Crusades, and even from the old conquering  Goths and Vikings, has distinguished the attitude of the Northern soul  to its world, appears also in the sense-transcending energy, the dynamic  of Western number. In the Apollinian mathematic the intellect is the  servant of the eye, in the Faustian its master. Mathematical, "absolute"  space, we see then, is utterly un-Classical, and from the first, although  mathematicians with their reverence for the Hellenic tradition did not dare  to observe the fact, it was something different from the indefinite spacious  ness of daily experience and customary painting, the a priori space of  Kant which seemed so unambiguous and sure a concept. It is a pure ab  stract, an ideal and unfulfillable postulate of a soul which is ever less and  less satisfied with sensuous means of expression and in the end pas  sionately brushes them aside. The inner eye has awakened.   And then, for the first time, those who thought deeply were obliged to  see that the Euclidean geometry, which is the true and only geometry of  the simple of all ages, is when regarded from the higher standpoint nothing  but a hypothesis, the general validity of which, since Gauss, we know it  to be quite impossible to prove in the face of other and perfectly non-  perceptual geometries. The critical proposition of this geometry, Euclid's  axiom of parallels, is an assertion, for which we are quite at liberty to  substitute another assertion. We may assert, in fact, that through a given  point, no parallels, or two, or many parallels may be drawn to a given  straight line, and all these assumptions lead to completely irreproachable  geometries of three dimensions, which can be employed in physics and  even in astronomy, and are in some cases preferable to the Euclidean.   Even the simple axiom that extension is boundless (boundlessness, since  Riemann and the theory of curved space, is to be distinguished from end  lessness) at once contradicts the essential character of all immediate per  ception, hi that the latter depends upon the existence of light-resistances  and ipso facto has material bounds. But abstract principles of boundary  can be imagined which transcend, in an entirely new sense, the possibili  ties of optical definition. For the deep thinker, there exists even in the  Cartesian geometry the tendency to get beyond the three dimensions of  experiential space, regarded as an unnecessary restriction on the symbol  ism of number. And although it was not till about 1800 that the notion of  multi-dimensional space (it is a pity that no better word was found)  provided analysis with broader foundations, the real first step was taken  at the moment when powers that is, really, logarithms were released  from their original relation with sensually realizable surfaces and solids     Oswald Spcngler  2346   and, through the employment of irrational and complex exponents,  brought within the realm of function as perfectly general relation-values.  It will be admitted by everyone who understands anything of mathemati  cal reasoning that directly we passed from the notion of a 3 as a natural  maximum to that of a*, the unconditional necessity of three-dimensional  space was done away with.   Once the space-element or point had lost its last persistent relic of  visualness and, instead of being represented to the eye as a cut in co  ordinate lines, was defined as a group of three independent numbers,  there was no longer any inherent objection to replacing the number 3 by  the general number n. The notion of dimension was radically changed.  It was no longer a matter of treating the properties of a point metrically  with reference to its position in a visible system, but of representing the  entirely abstract properties of a number-group by means of any dimen  sions that we please. The number-group consisting of n independent  ordered elements is an image of the point and it is called a point. Simi  larly, an equation logically arrived therefrom is called a plane and is the  image of a plane. And the aggregate of all points of n dimensions is  called an n-dimensional space. 20 In these transcendent space-worlds, which  are remote from every sort of sensualism, lie the relations which it is the  business of analysis to investigate and which are found to be consistently  in agreement with the data of experimental physics. This space of higher  degree is a symbol which is through-and-through the peculiar property of  the Western mind. That mind alone has attempted, and successfully too,  to capture the "become" and the extended in these forms, to conjure and  bind to "know" the alien by this kind of appropriation or taboo. Not  until such spheres of number-thought are reached, and not for any men  but the few who have reached them, do such imaginings as systems of  hypercomplex numbers (e.g., the quaternions of the calculus of vectors)  and apparently quite meaningless symbols like oo n acquire the character  of something actual. And here if anywhere it must be understood that  actuality is not only sensual actuality. The spiritual is in no wise limited  to perception-forms for the actualizing of its idea.   * * * * *   From this grand intuition of symbolic space-worlds came the last and  conclusive creation of Western mathematic the expansion and subtilizing  of the function theory in that of groups. Groups are aggregates or sets of  homogeneous mathematical images e.g., the totality of all differential  equations of a certain type which in structure and ordering are analo-   20 From the standpoint of the theory of "aggregates" (or "sets of points"), a well-  ordered set of points, irrespective of the dimension figure, is called a corpus; and thus  an aggregate of n 1 dimensions is considered, relatively to one of n dimensions,  as a surface. Thus the limit (wall, edge) of an "aggregate'* represents an aggregate of  lower "potentiality."     Meaning of Numbers     2347     gous to the Dedekind number-bodies. Here are worlds, we feel, of per  fectly new numbers, which are nevertheless not utterly sense-transcendent  for the Inner eye of the adept; and the problem now is to discover in those  vast abstract form-systems certain elements which, relatively to a particu  lar group of operations (viz., of transformations of the system), remain  unaffected thereby, that is, possess invariance. In mathematical language,  the problem, as stated generally by Klein, is given an n-dimensional  manifold ("space") and a group of transformations, it is required to  examine the forms belonging to the manifold in respect of such properties  as are not altered by transformation of the group.   And with this culmination our Western mathematic, having exhausted  every inward possibility and fulfilled its destiny as the copy and purest  expression of the idea of the Faustian soul, closes its development in the  same way as the mathematic of the Classical Culture concluded in the  third century. Both those sciences (the only ones of which the organic  structure can even to-day be examined historically) arose out of a wholly  new idea of number, in the one case Pythagoras's, in the other Descartes'.  Both, expanding in all beauty, reached their maturity one hundred years  later; and both, after flourishing for three centuries, completed the struc  ture of their ideas at the same moment as the Cultures to which they  respectively belonged passed over into the phase of megalopolitan Civili  zation. The deep significance of this interdependence will be made clear  in due course. It is enough for the moment that for us the time of the  great mathematicians is past. Our tasks to-day are those of preserving,  rounding off, refining, selection in place of big dynamic creation, the  same clever detail-work which characterized the Alexandrian mathematic  of late Hellenism.

WHITE     "He's [the Red King's] dreaming now," said Tweedledee: "and what do  you think he's dreaming about?"   Alice said, "Nobody can guess that."   "Why, about your Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands trium  phantly. "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose  you'd be?"   "Where I am now, of course," said Alice.   "Not you!" Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. "You'd be nowhere.  Why, you're only a sort of thing in his dream!"   "If that there King was to wake," added Tweedledum, "you'd go out  bang! just like a candle."   "I shouldn't!" Alice exclaimed indignantly. "Besides, if I'm only a sort  of thing in his dream, what are you, I should like to know?"   "Ditto," said Tweedledum.   "Ditto, ditto!" cried Tweedledee.   He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn't help saying "Hush! You'll  be waking him, I'm afraid, if you make so much noise."   "Well, it's no use your talking about waking him," said Tweedledum,  "when you're only one of the things in his dream. You know very well  you're not real."   "I am real!" said Alice, and began to cry.   "You won't make yourself a bit realler by crying," Tweedledee re  marked: "there's nothing to cry about."   "If I wasn't real," Alice said half laughing through her tears, it all  seemed so ridiculous "I shouldn't be able to cry."   "I hope you don't suppose those are real tears?" Tweedledum inter  rupted in a tone of great contempt.   Through the Looking Glass   DO mathematical truths reside in the external world, there to be discov  ered by man, or are they man-made inventions? Does mathematical reality  have an existence and a validity independent of the human species or is it  merely a function of the human nervous system?   Opinion has been and still is divided on this question. Mrs. Mary  Somerville (1780-1872), an Englishwoman who knew or corresponded  with such men as Sir John Herschel, Laplace, Gay Lussac, W. Whewell,  John Stuart Mill, Baron von Humboldt, Faraday, Cuvier, and De Can-   2348     The Locus oj Mathematical Reality: An Anthropological Footnote 2349   dolle, and who was herself a scholar of distinction, 1 expressed a view  widely held when she said: 2   "Nothing has afforded me so convincing a proof of the unity of the  Deity as these purely mental conceptions of numerical and mathematical  science which have been hy slow degrees vouchsafed to man, and are still  granted in these latter times by the Differential Calculus, now superseded  by the Higher Algebra, all of which must have existed in that sublimely  omniscient Mind from eternity."   Lest it be thought that Mrs. Somerville was more theological than scien  tific in her outlook, let it be noted that she was denounced, by name and  in public from the pulpit by Dean Cockburn of York Cathedral for her  support of science. 3   In America, Edward Everett (1794-1865), a distinguished scholar (the  first American to win a doctorate at Gottingen), reflected the enlightened  view of his day when he declared: 4   "In the pure mathematics we contemplate absolute truths which existed  in the divine mind before the morning stars sang together, and which will  continue to exist there when the last of their radiant host shall have fallen  from heaven."   In our own day, a prominent British mathematician, G. H. Hardy, has  expressed the same view with, however, more technicality than rhetorical  flourish: 5   "I believe that mathematical reality lies outside us, and that our func  tion is to discover or observe it, and that the theorems which we prove,  and which we describe grandiloquently as our 'creations' are simply our  notes of our observations." 6   Taking the opposite view we find the distinguished physicist, P. W.  Bridgman, asserting that "it is the merest truism, evident at once to un  sophisticated observation, that mathematics is a human invention." 7 Ed  ward Kasner and James Newman state that "we have overcome the notion   1 She wrote the following works, some of which went into several editions: The  Mechanism of the Heavens, 1831 (which was, it seems, a popularization of the  Mecanique Celeste of Laplace); The Connection of the Physical Sciences, 1858;  Molecular and Microscopic Science, 1869; Physical Geography, 1870.   2 Personal Recollections of Mary Somerville, edited by her daughter, Martha  Somerville, pp. 140-141 (Boston, 1874).   3 ibid., p. 375.

Bell in The Queen of the Sciences, p. 20 (Baltimore, 1931).   5 G. H. Hardy, A Mathematician's Apology, pp. 63-64 (Cambridge, England; 1941).   6 The mathematician is not, of course, the only one who is inclined to believe that  his creations are discoveries of things in the external world. The theoretical physicist,  too, entertains this belief. "To him who is a discoverer in this field," Einstein observes,  "the products of his imagination appear so necessary and natural that he regards  them, and would like to have them regarded by others, not as creations of thought  but as given realities," ("On the Method of Theoretical Physics," in The World as  1 See It, p. 30; New York, 1934).   7 P. W. Bridgman, The Logic of Modern Physics, p. 60 (New York, 1927).     Leslie A. White  2350   that mathematical truths have an existence independent and apart from  our own minds. It is even strange to us that such a notion could ever have   existed." 8   From a psychological and anthropological point of view, this latter  conception is the only one that is scientifically sound and valid. There is  no more reason to believe that mathematical realities have an existence  independent of the human mind than to believe that mythological realities  can have their being apart from man. The square root of minus one is  real. So were Wotan and Osiris. So are the gods and spirits that primitive  peoples believe in today. The question at issue, however, is not, Are these  things real?, but Where is the locus of their reality? It is a mistake to  identify reality with the external world only. Nothing is more real than  an hallucination.   Our concern here, however, is not to establish one view of mathematical  reality as sound, the other illusory. What we propose to do is to present  the phenomenon of mathematical behavior in such a way as to make clear,  on the one hand, why the belief in the independent existence of mathe  matical truths has seemed so plausible and convincing for so many cen  turies, and, on the other, to show that all of mathematics is nothing more  than a particular kind of primate behavior.   Many persons would unhesitatingly subscribe to the proposition that  "mathematical reality must lie either within us, or outside us." Are these  not the only possibilities? As Descartes once reasoned in discussing the  existence of God, "it is impossible we can have the idea or representation  of anything whatever, unless there be somewhere, either in us or out of us,  an original which comprises, in reality . . ." 9 (emphasis ours). Yet,  irresistible though this reasoning may appear to be, it is, in our present  problem, fallacious or at least treacherously misleading. The following  propositions, though apparently precisely opposed to each other, are  equally valid; one is as true as the other: 1. "Mathematical truths have  an existence and a validity independent of the human mind," and 2.  "Mathematical truths have no existence or validity apart from the human  mind." Actually, these propositions, phrased as they are, are misleading  because the term "the human mind" is used in two different senses. In  the first statement, "the human mind" refers to the individual organism;  in the second, to the human species. Thus both propositions can be, and  actually are, true. Mathematical truths exist in the cultural tradition into  which the individual is born, and so enter his mind from the outside. But  apart from cultural tradition, mathematical concepts have neither exist  ence nor meaning, and of course, cultural tradition has no existence apart   8 Edward Kasner and James Newman, Mathematics and the Imagination, p. 359  (New York, 1940).   9 Principles of Philosophy, Pt. I, Sec. XVIII, p. 308, edited by J. Veitch (New  York, 1901).     The Locus of Mathematical Reality: An Anthropological Footnote 2351   from the human species. Mathematical realities thus have an existence  independent of the individual mind, but are wholly dependent upon the  mind of the species. Or, to put the matter in anthropological terminology:  mathematics in its entirety, its "truths" and its "realities," is a part of  human culture, nothing more. Every individual is born into a culture  which already existed and which is independent of him. Culture traits  have an existence outside of the individual mind and independent of it.  The individual obtains his culture by learning the customs, beliefs, tech  niques of his group. But culture itself has, and can have, no existence  apart from the human species. Mathematics, therefore like language,  institutions, tools, the arts, etc. is the cumulative product of ages of  endeavor of the human species.   The great French savant Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) was one of the  first to make this clear. He discussed it in the early pages of The Elemen  tary Forms of the Religious Life. 10 And in The Rules of Sociological  Method ll especially he set forth the nature of culture 12 and its relation  ship to the human mind. Others, too, have of course discussed the rela  tionship to the human mind. Others, too, have of course discussed the rela  tionship between man and culture, 13 but Durkheim's formulations are  especially appropriate for our present discussion and we shall call upon  him to speak for us from time to time.   Culture is the anthropologist's technical term for the mode of life of  any people, no matter how primitive or advanced. It is the generic term  of which civilization is a specific term. The mode of life, or culture, of the  human species is distinguished from that of all other species by the use of  symbols. Man is the only living being that can freely and arbitrarily im  pose value or meaning upon any thing, which is what we mean by  "using symbols." The most important and characteristic form of symbol  behavior is articulate speech. All cultures, all of civilization, have come  into being, have grown and developed, as a consequence of the symbolic  faculty, unique in the human species. 14   tfssfo Les Formes tlementalres de la Vie Religieuse (Paris, 1912) translated by J. W.  Swain (London, 1915). Nathan Altshiller-Court refers to Durkheim's treatment of this  point in "Geometry and Experience,'* (Scientific Monthly, Vol. LX, No. 1, pp. 63-66,  Jan., 1945).   11 Les Regies de la Methode Sociologique (Paris, 1895; translated by Sarah A.  Solovay and John H. Mueller, edited by George E. G. Catlin; Chicago, 1938).   12 Durkheim did not use the term culture. Instead he spoke of the "collective con  sciousness," "collective representations," etc. Because of his unfortunate phraseology  Durkheim has been misunderstood and even branded mystical. But it is obvious to  one who understands both Durkheim and such anthropologists as R. H. Lowie, A. L.  Kjftgber and Clark Wissler that they are all talking about the same thing: culture.   "w^See, e.g., E. B. Tylor, Anthropology (London, 1881); R. H. Lowie, Culture and  Ethnology, New York, 1917; A. L. Kroeber, "The Superorganic," (American Anthro  pologist, Vol. 19, pp. 163-213; 1917); Clark Wissler, Man and Culture, (New York,  1923).   14 See, White, Leslie A., "The Symbol: the Origin and Basis of Human Behavior,"  (Philosophy of Science, Vol. 7, pp. 451-463; 1940; reprinted in ETC., a Review of  General Semantics, Vol. I, pp. 229-237; 1944).     2352 Leslie A. White   Every culture of the present day, no matter how simple or primitive,  is a product of great antiquity. The language, tools, customs, beliefs,  forms of art, etc., of any people are things which have been handed down  from generation to generation, from age to age, changing and growing  as they went, but always keeping unbroken the connection with the past.  Every people lives not merely in a habitat of mountains or plains, of lakes,  woods, and starry heavens, but in a setting of beliefs, customs, dwellings,  tools, and rituals as well. Every individual is born into a man-made world  of culture as well as the world of nature. But it is the culture rather than  the natural habitat that determines man's thought, feelings, and behavior.  To be sure, the natural environment may favor one type of activity or  render a certain mode of life impossible. But whatever man does, as indi  vidual or as society, is determined by the culture into which he, or they,  are born. 15 Culture is a great organization of stimuli that flows down  through the ages, shaping and directing the behavior of each generation  of human organisms as it goes. Human behavior is response to these  cultural stimuli which seize upon each organism at birth indeed, from  the moment of conception, and even before this and hold it in their  embrace until death and beyond, through mortuary customs and beliefs  in a land of the dead.   The language a people speaks is the response to the linguistic stimuli  which impinge upon the several organisms in infancy and childhood. One  group of organisms is moulded by Chinese-language stimuli; another, by  English, The organism has no choice, and once cast into a mould is un  able to change. To learn to speak a foreign language without accent after  one has matured, or even, in most cases, to imitate another dialect of his  own language is exceedingly difficult if not impossible for most people.  So it is in other realms of behavior. A people practices polygyny, has  matrilineal clans, cremates the dead, abstains from eating pork or peanuts,  counts by tens, puts butter in their tea, tattoos their chests, wears neckties,  believes in demons, vaccinates their children, scalps their vanquished foes  or tries them as war criminals, lends their wives to guests, uses slide rules,  plays pinochle, or extracts square roots // the culture into which they were  born possesses these traits. It is obvious, of course, that people do not  choose their culture; they inherit it. It is almost as obvious that a people  behaves as it does because it possesses a certain type of culture or more  accurately, is possessed by it.   \To return now to our proper subject. Mathematics is, of course, a part  of culture. Every people inherits from its predecessors, or contemporary  neighbors, along with ways of cooking, marrying, worshipping, etc., ways  of counting, calculating, and whatever else mathematics does. Mathe-   15 Individuals vary, of course, in their constitutions and consequently may vary in  their responses to cultural stimuli.     The Locus of Mathematical Reality: An Anthropological Footnote 2353   matics is, in fact, a form of behavior: the responses of a particular kind  of primate organism to a set of stimuli. Whether a people counts by fives,  tens, twelves or twenties; whether it has no words for cardinal numbers  beyond 5, or possesses the most modern and highly developed mathemat  ical conceptions, their mathematical behavior is determined by the mathe  matical culture which possesses them. I   We can see now how the belief that mathematical truths and realities lie  outside the human mind arose and flourished. They do lie outside the  mind of each individual organism. They enter the individual mind as  Durkheim says from the outside. They impinge upon his organism, again  to quote Durkheim, just as cosmic forces do. Any mathematician can see,  by observing himself as well as others, that this is so. Mathematics is not  something that is secreted, like bile; it is something drunk, like wine.  Hottentot boys grow up and behave, mathematically as well as otherwise,  in obedience to and in conformity with the mathematical and other traits  in their culture. English or American youths do the same in their respec  tive cultures. There is not one iota of anatomical or psychological evidence  to indicate that there are any significant innate, biological or racial differ  ences so far as mathematical or any other kind of human behavior is  concerned. Had Newton been reared in Hottentot culture he would have  calculated like a Hottentot. | Men like G. H. Hardy, who know, through  their own experience as well as from the observation of others, that mathe  matical realities enter the mind from the outside, understandably but  erroneously conclude that they have their origin and locus in the external  world, independent of man. Erroneous, because the alternative to "outside  the human mind," the individual mind, that is, is not "the external world,  independent of man," but culture, the body of traditional thought and  behavior of the human species. \   Culture frequently plays tricks upon us and distorts our thinking. We  tend to find in culture direct expressions of "human nature" on the one  hand and of the external world on the other. Thus each people is disposed  to believe that its own customs and beliefs are direct and faithful expres  sions of man's nature. It is "human nature," they think, to practice  monogamy, to be jealous of one's wife, to bury the dead, drink milk, to  appear in public only when clad, to call your mother's brother's children  "cousin," to enjoy exclusive right to the fruit of your toil, etc., if they  happen to have these particular customs. But ethnography tells us that  there is the widest divergence of custom among the peoples of the world:  there are peoples who loathe milk, practice polyandry, lend wives as a  mark of hospitality, regard inhumation with horror, appear hi public  without clothing and without shame, call their mother's brother's children  "son" and "daughter," and who freely place all or the greater portion of  the produce of their toil at the disposal of their fellows. There is no cus-     2354 Leslie A. White   torn or belief that can be said to express "human nature" more than any  other.   Similarly it has been thought that certain conceptions of the external  world were so simple and fundamental that they immediately and faith  fully expressed its structure and nature. One is inclined to think that  yellow, blue, and green are features of the external world which any  normal person would distinguish until he learns that the Creek and  Natchez Indians did not distinguish yellow from green; they had but one  term for both. Similarly, the Choctaw, Tunica, the Keresan Pueblo Indians  and many other peoples make no terminological distinction between blue  and green. 16   The great Newton was deceived by his culture, too. He took it for  granted that the concept of absolute space directly and immediately corre  sponded to something in the external world; space, he thought, is some  thing that has an existence independent of the human mind. "I do not  frame hypotheses," he said. But the concept space is a creation of the  intellect as are other concepts. To be sure, Newton himself did not create  the hypothesis of absolute space. It came to him from the outside, as  Durkheim properly puts it. But although it impinges upon the organism  comme les forces cosmlques, it has a different source: it is not the cosmos  but man's culture.   For centuries it was thought that the theorems of Euclid were merely  conceptual photographs, so to speak, of the external world; that they had  a validity quite independent of the human mind; that there was something  necessary and inevitable about them. The invention of non-Euclidean  geometries by Lobatchewsky, Riemann and others has dispelled this view  entirely. It is now clear that concepts such as space, straight line, plane,  etc., are no more necessary and inevitable as a consequence of the struc  ture of the external world than are the concepts green and yellow or the  relationship term with which you designate your mother's brother, for  that matter.   To quote Einstein again: 17   "We come now to the question: what is a priori certain or necessary,  respectively in geometry (doctrine of space) or its foundations? Formerly  we thought everything; nowadays we think nothing. Already the dis  tance-concept is logically arbitrary; there need be no things that corre  spond to it, even approximately."   Kasner and Newman say that "non-Euclidean geometry is proof that  mathematics ... is man's own handiwork, subject only to the limitations  imposed by the laws of thought. 7 ' 1S   16 Cf.

Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition.   18 op. cit., p. 359.     The Locus of Mathematical Reality: An Anthropological Footnote 2355   Far from having an existence and a validity apart from the human  species, all mathematical concepts are u free inventions of the human intel  lect," to use a phrase with which Einstein characterizes the concepts and  fundamental principles of physics. 19 But because mathematical and scien  tific concepts have always entered each individual mind from the outside,  everyone until recently has concluded that they came from the external  world instead of from man-made culture. But the concept of culture, as a  scientific concept, is hut a recent invention itself.   The cultural nature of our scientific concepts and beliefs is clearly  recognized by the Nobel prize winning physicist, Erwin Schrodinger, in  the following passage: 20   "Whence arises the widespread belief that the behavior of molecules is  determined by absolute causality, whence the conviction that the contrary  is unthinkable! Simply from the custom, inherited through thousands of  years, of thinking causally, which makes the idea of undetermined events,  of absolute, primary causalness, seem complete nonsense, a logical absurd  ity," (Schrddinger's emphases).   Similarly, Henri Poincare asserts that the axioms of geometry are mere  "conventions," i.e., customs: they "are neither synthetic a priori judgments  nor experimental facts. They are conventions . . ." 21   We turn now to another aspect of mathematics that is illuminated by  the concept of culture. Heinrich Hertz, the discoverer of wireless waves,  once said: M   "One cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulas have  an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are  wiser than we are, wiser even than their discoverers [sic], that we get  more out of them than was originally put into them."   Here again we encounter the notion that mathematical formulas have  an existence "of their own," (i.e., independent of the human species), and  that they are "discovered," rather than man-made. The concept of culture  clarifies the entire situation. Mathematical formulas, like other aspects of  culture, do have in a sense an "independent existence and intelligence of  their own." The English language has, in a sense, "an independent exist  ence of its own." Not independent of the human species, of course, but  independent of any individual or group of individuals, race or nation. It  has, in a sense, an "intelligence of its own." That is, it behaves, grows  and changes in accordance with principles which are inherent in the  language itself, not hi the human mind. As man becomes self-conscious   19 "On the Method of Theoretical Physics," in The World as I See It, p. 33 (New  York, 1934).   20 Science and the Human Temperament, p. 115 (London, 1935).   21 "On the Nature of Axioms," in Science and Hypothesis, published in The  Foundations of Science (The Science Press, New York, 1913).   22 Quoted by E. T. Bell, Men of Mathematics, p. 16 (New York, 1937).     Leslie A, White  2356   of language, and as the science of philology matures, the principles of  linguistic behavior are discovered and its laws formulated.   So it is with mathematical and scientific concepts. In a very real sense  they have a life of their own. This life is the life of culture, of cultural  tradition. As Durkheim expresses it: 23 "Collective ways of acting and  thinking have a reality outside the individuals who, at every moment of  time, conform to it. These ways of thinking and acting exist in their own  right." It would be quite possible to describe completely and adequately  the evolution of mathematics, physics, money, architecture, axes, plows,  language, or any other -aspect of culture without ever alluding to the hu  man species or any portion of it. As a matter of fact, the most effective  way to study culture scientifically is to proceed as if the human race did  not exist. To be sure it is often convenient to refer to the nation that first  coined money or to the man who invented the calculus or the cotton gin.  But it is not necessary, nor, strictly speaking, relevant. The phonetic  shifts in Indo-European as summarized by Grimm's law have to do solely  with linguistic phenomena, with sounds and their permutations, combina  tions and interactions. They can be dealt with adequately without any  reference to the anatomical, physiological, or psychological characteristics  of the primate organisms who produced them. And so it is with mathe  matics and physics. Concepts have a life of their own. Again to quote  Durkheim, "when once born, [they] obey laws all their own. They attract  each other, repel each other, unite, divide themselves and multiply.   . ." 24 Ideas, like other culture traits, interact with each other, forming  new syntheses and combinations. Two or three ideas coming together may  form a new concept or synthesis. The laws of motion associated with  Newton were syntheses of concepts associated with Galileo, Kepler and  others. Certain ideas of electrical phenomena grow from the "Faraday  stage," so to speak, to those of Clerk Maxwell, H. Hertz, Marconi, and  modern radar. "The application of Newton's mechanics to continuously  distributed masses led inevitably to the discovery and application of partial  differential equations, which in their turn first provided the language for  the laws of the field-theory," 25 (emphasis ours). The theory of relativity  was, as Einstein observes, "no revolutionary act, but the natural continua  tion of a line that can be traced through centuries." 26 More immediately,  "the theory of Clerk Maxwell and Lorentz led inevitably to the special  theory of relativity." 27 Thus we see not only that any given thought-   23 The Rules of Sociological Method, Preface to 2nd edition, p. Ivi.   24 The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, p. 424. See also The Rules of  Sociological Method, Preface to 2nd edition, p. li, in which he says "we need to  investigate ... the manner in which social representations [i.e., culture traits] adhere  to and repel one another, how they fuse or separate from one another."   25 Einstein, "The Mechanics of Newton and their Influence on the Development of  Theoretical Physics," in The World as I See It, p. 58.   26 "On the Theory of Relativity," in The World as I See It, p. 69.   27 Einstein, "The Mechanics of Newton &c," p. 57.     The Locus of Mathematical Reality: An Anthropological Footnote ' 2357   system is an outgrowth of previous experience, but that certain ideas lead  inevitably to new concepts and new systems. Any tool, machine, belief,  philosophy, custom or institution is but the outgrowth of previous culture  traits. An understanding of the nature of culture makes clear, therefore,  why Hertz felt that "mathematical formulas have an independent existence  and an intelligence of their own."   His feeling that "we get more out of them than was originally put into  them," arises from the fact that in the interaction of culture traits new  syntheses are formed which were not anticipated by "their discoverers,"  or which contained implications that were not seen or appreciated until  further growth made them more explicit. Sometimes novel features of a  newly formed synthesis are not seen even by the person in whose nervous  system the synthesis took place. Thus Jacques Hadamard tells us of  numerous instances in which he failed utterly to see things that "ought to  have struck . . . [him] blind." 28 He cites numerous instances in which  he failed to see "obvious and immediate consequences of the ideas con  tained" 28 in the work upon which he was engaged, leaving them to be  "discovered" by others later.   The contradiction between the view held by Hertz, Hardy and others  that mathematical truths are discovered rather than man-made is thus  resolved by the concept of culture. They are both; they are discovered but  they are also man-made. They are the product of the mind of the human  species. But they are encountered or discovered by each individual in the  mathematical culture in which he grows up. The process of mathematical  growth is, as we have pointed out, one of interaction of mathematical  elements upon each other. This process requires, of course, a basis in the  brains of men, just as a telephone conversation requires wires, receivers,  transmitters, etc. But we do not need to take the brains of men into  account in an explanation of mathematical growth and invention any more  than we have to take the telephone wires into consideration when we wish  to explain the conversation it carries. Proof of this lies hi the fact of  numerous inventions (or "discoveries") in mathematics made simultane  ously by two or more person working independently. 30 If these discoveries   28 Jacques Hadamard, The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field, p. 50  (Princeton, 1945).   29 ibid., p. 51.   30 The following data are taken from a long and varied list published in Social  Change, by Wm. F. Ogburn (New York, 1923), pp. 90-102, in which simultaneous  inventions and discoveries in the fields of chemistry, physics, biology, mechanical  invention, etc., as well as in mathematics, are listed.

On the basis of the laws of chance these  numerous and repeated coincidences would be nothing short of miracu  lous. But the culturological explanation makes the whole situation clear  at once. The whole population of a certain region is embraced by a type  of culture. Each individual is born into a pre-existing organization of  beliefs, tools, customs and institutions. These culture traits shape and  mould each person's life, give it content and direction. Mathematics is,  of course, one of the streams in the total culture. It acts upon individuals  in varying degree, and they respond according to their constitutions. Math  ematics is the organic behavior response to the mathematical culture.   But we have already noted that within the body of mathematical culture  there is action and reaction among the various elements. Concept reacts  upon concept; ideas mix, fuse, form new syntheses. This process goes on  throughout the whole extent of culture although more rapidly and inten  sively in some regions (usually the center) than in others (the periphery).  When this process of interaction and development reaches a certain point,  new syntheses 31 are formed of themselves. These syntheses are, to be  sure, real events, and have location in time and place. The places are of  course the brains of men. Since the cultural process has been going on  rather uniformly over a wide area and population, the new synthesis takes  place simultaneously in a number of brains at once. Because we are habit  ually anthropocentric in our thinking we tend to say that these men made  these discoveries. And in a sense, a biological sense, they did. But if we  wish to explain the discovery as an event in the growth of mathematics  we must rule the individual out completely. From this standpoint, the  individual did not make the discovery at all. It was something that hap  pened to him. He was merely the place where the lightning struck. A  simultaneous "discovery" by three men working "independently" simply  means that cultural-mathematical lightning can and does strike in more  than one place at a time. In the process of cultural growth, through inven  tion or discovery, the individual is merely the neural medium in which   The double theta functions: Gopel, 1847; Rosenhain, 1847.

The Locus of Mathematical Reality: An Anthropological Footnote 2359   the "culture" 32 of ideas grows. Man's brain is merely a catalytic agent,  so to speak, in the cultural process. This process cannot exist independ  ently of neural tissue, but the function of man's nervous system is merely  to make possible the interaction and re-synthesis of cultural elements.   To be sure individuals differ just as catalytic agents, lightning conduc  tors or other media do. One person, one set of brains, may be a better  medium for the growth of mathematical culture than another. One man's  nervous system may be a better catalyst for the cultural process than that  of another. The mathematical cultural process is therefore more likely to  select one set of brains than another as its medium of expression. But it  is easy to exaggerate the role of superior brains in cultural advance. It is  not merely superiority of brains that counts. There must be a juxtaposition  of brains with the interactive, synthesizing cultural process. If the cultural  elements are lacking, superior brains will be of no avail. There were brains  as good as Newton's in England 10,000 years before the birth of Christ,  at the time of the Norman conquest, or any other period of English  history. Everything that we know about fossil man, the prehistory of  England, and the neuro-anatomy of homo sapiens will support this state  ment. There were brains as good as Newton's in aboriginal America or in  Darkest Africa. But the calculus was not discovered or invented in these  other times and places because the requisite cultural elements were lack  ing. Contrariwise, when the cultural elements are present, the discovery or  invention becomes so inevitable that it takes place independently in two  or three nervous systems at once. Had Newton been reared as a sheep  herder, the mathematical culture of England would have found other  brains in which to achieve its new synthesis. One man's brains may be  better than another's, just as his hearing may be more acute or his feet  larger. But just as a "brilliant" general is one whose armies are victorious,  so a genius, mathematical or otherwise, is a person in whose nervous  system an important cultural synthesis takes place; he is the neural locus  of an epochal event in culture history. 33   The nature of the culture process and its relation to the minds of men is  well illustrated by the history of the theory of evolution in biology. As  is well known, this theory did not originate with Darwin. We find it in one  form or another, in the neural reactions of many others before Darwin  was born: Buffon, Lamarck, Erasmus Darwin, and others. As a matter of  fact, virtually all of the ideas which together we call Darwinism are to be  found in the writings of J. C. Prichard, an English physician and anthro  pologist (1786-1848). These various concepts were interacting upon each   32 We use "culture" here in its bacteriological sense: a culture of bacilli growing  in a gelatinous medium.   33 The distinguished anthropologist, A. L. Kroeber, defines geniuses as "the indi  cators of the realization of coherent patterns of cultural value," Configurations of  Culture Growth, p. 839 (Berkeley, 1944).     Leslie A. White   2360   other and upon current theological beliefs, competing, struggling, being  modified, combined, re-synthesized, etc, for decades. The time finally  came, i.e., the stage of development was reached, where the theological  system broke down and the risng tide of scientific interpretation inundated   the land. . .   Here again the new synthesis of concepts found expression simultane  ously in the nervous systems of two men working independently of each  other- A R. Wallace and Charks Darwin. The event had to take place  when it did. If Darwin had died in infancy, the cultural process would  have found another neural medium of expression.   This illustration is especially interesting because we have a vivid ac  count, in Darwin's own words, of the way in which the "discovery" (i.e.,  the synthesis of ideas) took place:   "In October 1838," Darwin wrote in his autobiographic sketch, "that is,  fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to  read for amusement 'Malthus on Population,' and being well prepared to  appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-  continued observatioa of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck  me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be  preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would  be the formation of a new species. Here then I had at last gat a theory  by which to work . . ." (emphasis ours).   This is an exceedingly interesting revelation. At the time he read  Malthus, Darwin's mind was filled with various ideas, (i.e., he had been  moulded, shaped, animated and equipped by the cultural milieu into  which he happened to have been born and reared a significant aspect of  which was independent means; had he been obliged to earn his living in  a "counting house" we might have had "Hudsonism" today instead of  Darwinism) . These ideas reacted upon each other, competing, eliminating,  strengthening, combining. Into this situation was introduced, by chance,  a peculiar combination of cultural elements (ideas) which bears the name  of Malthus. Instantly a reaction took place, a new synthesis was formed  "here at last he had a theory by which to work." Darwin's nervous system  was merely the place where these cultural elements came together and  formed a new synthesis. It was something that happened to Darwin rather  than something he did.   This account of invention in the field of biology calls to mind the well-  known incident of mathematical invention described so vividly by Henri  Poincare. One evening, after working very hard on a problem but without  success, he writes: 34   '*. . . contrary to my custom, I drank black coffee and could not sleep.   34 "Mathematical Creation," in Science and Method, published in The Foundations  of Science, p. 387 (The Science Press; New York and Garrison, 1913).     The Locus of Mathematical Reality: An Anthropological Footnote 2361   Ideas rose in crowds; I felt them collide until pairs interlocked, so to  speak, making a stable combination. By the next morning I had established  the existence of a class of Fuchsian functions ... I had only to write  out the results, which took but a few hours."   Poincare further illustrates the process of culture change and growth  in its subjective (i.e., neural) aspect by means of an imaginative analogy. 35  He imagines mathematical ideas as being something like "the hooked  atoms of Epicurus. During complete repose of the mind, these atoms are  motionless, they are, so to speak, hooked to the wall." No combinations  are formed. But in mental activity, even unconscious activity, certain of  the atoms "are detached from the wall and put in motion. They flash in  every direction through space . . . like the molecules of a gas . . .  Then their mutual impacts may produce new combinations." This is  merely a description of the subjective aspect of the cultural process which  the anthropologist would describe objectively (i.e., without reference to  nervous systems). He would say that in cultural systems, traits of various  kinds act and react upon each other, eliminating some, reinforcing others,  forming new combinations and syntheses. The significant thing about the  loci of inventions and discoveries from the anthropologist's standpoint is  not quality of brains, but relative position within the culture area: inven  tions and discoveries are much more likely to take place at culture centers,  at places where there is a great deal of cultural interaction, than on the  periphery, in remote or isolated regions.   If mathematical ideas enter the mind of the individual mathematician  from the outside, from the stream of culture into which he was born and  reared, the question arises, where did culture in general, and mathematical  culture in particular, come from in the first place ? How did it arise and  acquire its content?   It goes without saying of course that mathematics did not originate with  Euclid and Pythagoras or even with the thinkers of ancient Egypt and  Mesopotamia. Mathematics is a development of thought that had its be  ginning with the origin of man and culture a million years or so ago. To  be sure, little progress was made during hundreds of thousands of years.  Still, we find in mathematics today systems and concepts that were devel  oped by primitive and preliterate peoples of the Stone Ages, survivals of  which are to be found among savage tribes today. The system of counting  by tens arose from using the fingers of both hands. The vigesimal system  of the Maya astronomers grew out of the use of toes as well as fingers.  To calculate is to count with calculi, pebbles. A straight line was a  stretched linen cord, and so on.   To be sure, the first mathematical ideas to exist were brought into being   35 ibid., p. 393.     Leslie A. White  2362   by the nervous systems of individual human beings They were however  exceedingly simple and rudimentary. Had it not been for the human  aSity to give these ideas overt expression in symbolic form and to com  municate Them to one another so that new combinations would be formed  and these new syntheses passed on from one generation to another in a  continuous process of interaction and accumulation the human spe<*es  would have made no mathematical progress beyond * imtial stage. This  statement is supported by our studies of anthropoid apes. They are exceed  ingly intelligent and versatile. They have a fine appreciation of geomemc  forms, solve problems by imagination and insight, and possess no a little  originality."' But they cannot express their neuro-sensory-muscular con  cepts in overt symbolic form. They cannot communicate their Weas to one  another except by gestures, i.e., by signs rather than symbols. Hence ideas  cannot react upon one another in their minds to produce new syntheses.  Nor can these ideas be transmitted from one generation to another in a  cumulative manner. Consequently, one generation of apes begins where  the preceding generation began. There is neither accumulation nor   progress. 37   Thanks to articulate speech, the human species fares better. Ideas are  cast into symbolic form and given overt expression. Communication is  thus made easy and versatile. Ideas now impinge upon nervous systems  from the outside. These ideas react upon each other within these nervous  systems. Some are eliminated; others strengthened. New combinations are  formed, new syntheses achieved. Tliese advances are in turn communi  cated to someone else, transmitted to the next generation. In a relatively  short time, the accumulation of mathematical ideas has gone beyond the  creative range of the individual human nervous system unaided by cultural  tradition. From this time on, mathematical progress is made by the inter  action of ideas already in existence rather than by the creation of new  concepts by the human nervous system alone. Ages before writing was  invented, individuals in all cultures were dependent upon the mathematical  ideas present in their respective cultures. Thus, the mathematical behavior  of an Apache Indian is the response that he makes to stimuli provided by  the mathematical ideas in his culture. The same was true for Neanderthal  man and the inhabitants of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece. It is  true for individuals of modern nations today.   Thus we see that mathematical ideas were produced originally by the  human nervous system when man first became a human being a million   36 See, W. Kohler's The Mentality of Apes (New York, 1931).   37 See Leslie A White "On the Use of Tools by Primates" (Journ. of Comparative  Psychology, Vol. 34, pp. 369-374, Dec. 1942). This essay attempts to show that the  human species has a highly developed and progressive material culture while apes do  not, although they can use tools with skill and versatility and even invent them,  because man, and not apes, can use symbols.     The Locus of Mathematical Reality: An Anthropological Footnote 2163   years ago. These concepts were exceedingly rudimentary, and the human  nervous system, unaided by culture, could never have gone beyond them  regardless of how many generations lived and died. It was the formation  of a cultural tradition which made progress possible. The communication  of ideas from person to person, the transmission of concepts from one  generation to another, placed in the minds of men (i.e., stimulated their  nervous systems) ideas which through interaction formed new syntheses  which were passed on in turn to others.   We return now, in conclusion, to some of the observations of G. H.  Hardy, to show that his conception of mathematical reality and mathe  matical behavior is consistent with the culture theory that we have pre  sented here and is, in fact, explained by it.   "I believe that mathematical reality lies outside us," 38 he says. If by  "us" he means "us mathematicians individually," he is quite right. They  do lie outside each one of us; they are a part of the culture into which we  are born. Hardy feels that "in some sense, mathematical truth is part of  objective reality," 39 (my emphasis, L.A.W.). But he also distinguishes  "mathematical reality" from "physical reality," and insists that "pure  geometries are not pictures . . . [of] the spatio-temporal reality of the  physical world." 40 What then is the nature of mathematical reality?  Hardy declares that "there is no sort of agreement . . . among either  mathematicians or philosophers" 41 on this point. Our interpretation pro  vides the solution. Mathematics does have objective reality. And this  reality, as Hardy insists, is not the reality of the physical world. But there  is no mystery about it. Its reality is cultural: the sort of reality possessed  by a code of etiquette, traffic regulations, the rules of baseball, the Eng  lish language or rules of grammar.   Thus we see that there is no mystery about mathematical reality. We  need not search for mathematical "truths" in the divine mind or in the  structure of the universe. Mathematics is a kind of primate behavior as  languages, musical systems and penal codes are. Mathematical concepts  are man-made just as ethical values, traffic rules, and bird cages are man-  made. But this does not invalidate the belief that mathematical proposi  tions lie outside us and have an objective reality. They do lie outside us.  They existed before we were born. As we grow up we find them in the  world about us. But this objectivity exists only for the individual. The  locus of mathematical reality is cultural tradition, i.e., the continuum of  symbolic behavior. This theory illuminates also the phenomena of novelty  and progress in mathematics. Ideas interact with each other in the nervous   38 A Mathematician's Apology, p. 6   39 "Mathematical Proof/' p. 4 (Mind, Vol. 38, pp. 1-25, 1929).   40 A Mathematician's Apology, pp. 62-63, 65.   41 ibid., p. 63.     234 Leslie A. White   systems of men and thus form new syntheses. If the owners of these nerv  ous systems are aware of what has taken place they call it invention as  Hadamard does, or "creation," to use Poincare's term. If they do not  understand what has happened, they call it a "discovery" and believe they  have found something in the external world. Mathematical concepts are  independent of the individual mind but lie wholly within the mind of the  species, i.e., culture. Mathematical invention and discovery are merely  two aspects of an event that takes place simultaneously in the cultural  tradition and in one or more nervous systems. Of these two factors, culture  is the more significant; the determinants of mathematical evolution lie  here. The human nervous system is merely the catalyst which makes the  cultural process possible.     PART XXVI     Amusements, Puzzles,  Fancies     1. Assorted Paradoxes by AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN   2.

Common Sense and the Universe by STEPHEN LEACOCK     COMMENTARY ON   AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN     AJGUSTUS DE MORGAN was a mathematician of considerable  merit, a brilliant and influential teacher, a founder, with George  Boole, of symbolic logic as it developed in England, a writer of many  books, an indefatigable contributor to encyclopedias, magazines and  learned journals. He was an uncompromising advocate of religious liberty  and free expression, an insatiable collector of curious lore, anecdotes,  quaint and perverse opinions, paradoxes, puzzles, riddles and puns; a  bibliomaniac, a wit and polemicist, a detester of hypocrisy and sordid  motive, an impolitic, independent, crotchety, overworked, lovable, friendly  and contentious Englishman. De Morgan admired Dickens, loathed the  country and was "a fair performer on the flute." This summary does him  scant justice; he was an original man even among mathematicians.   De Morgan was born in 1806 in Madras Province, India, where his  father was employed by the East India Company. He received his early  education in English private schools, which he hated. He had lost the use  of one eye in infancy: this made him shy and solitary, and exposed him  to jolly schoolboy pranks. One of them was to "come up stealthily to his  blind side and, holding a sharp-pointed penknife to his cheek, speak to him  suddenly by name. De Morgan on turning around received the point of  the knife in his face." l He managed to catch and thrash the "stout boy  of fourteen" who specialized in this sport. He did not then, or at any time  thereafter, allow bullies to push him around.   De Morgan made an excellent record at Trinity College, Cambridge.  He was recognized as far superior in mathematical ability to any man in  his year, but his wide reading and refusal to buckle down to the necessary  cramming resulted in his finishing only fourth in the mathematical tripos.  This was the first of many disappointments in his career. Because of  scruples against signing certain theological articles he called himself a  "Christian unattached" then required by the University, he was unable  to proceed to the M.A. degree and was ineligible for a fellowship. This  avenue being closed to him, De Morgan decided to try for the Bar, but a  short time after entering Lincoln's Inn he learned that he might have a  chance to teach mathematics at the newly formed University of London.  With the strong support of the leading Cambridge mathematicians, Pea  cock and Airy among them, who knew his worth, he was appointed in  1828 the first professor of mathematics of the institution later to be   1 Sophia Elizabeth De Morgan, Memoirs of Augustus De Morgan; London, 1882,  p. 5.     2366     Augustus De Morgan 2367   known as University College. In this post, save for an interruption of five  years, he served for thirty years.   As a teacher De Morgan was "unrivaled." His lectures were fluent and  lucid; unlike so many teachers, he cared that his hearers should be stimu  lated as well as instructed. He exhibited frequently his "quaint humor"  and his "thorough contempt for sham knowledge and low aims in study." 2  Above all, he hated competitive examinations and would not permit this  nonsensical practice in his classes. Walter Bagehot and Stanley Jevons  were two among the many of his pupils who later gained distinction.   It is impossible in this space even to enumerate De Morgan's writings  on mathematics, philosophy and random antiquarian matters. He pub  lished first-rate elementary texts on arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and  calculus, and important treatises on the theory of probability and formal  logic. In his celebrated Trigonometry and Double Algebra and, to a  greater extent in his Formal Logic, and in several memoirs in the Cam  bridge Philosophical Transactions, he considered the possibilities of estab  lishing a logical calculus and the fundamental problem of expressing  thought by means of symbols. 3 "Every science," he said, "that has thriven  has thriven upon its own symbols: logic, the only science which is ad  mitted to have made no improvements in century after century, is the  only one which has grown no symbols." 4 This deficiency he set out to  remedy. He had a profound appreciation of the close relationship between  logic and pure mathematics, and perceived how rich a field of discovery  lay in cultivating these disciplines jointly and not separately. While his  own achievements in this sphere were not equal to those of George Boole,  his studies in logic were of the highest value both in illuminating new  areas and in encouraging other workers to press further. 5   The writings just mentioned are the basis of De Morgan's reputation;  yet they represent much the smaller part of his total output. His income as  a professor was never large enough to support a wife, five children, and a  passion for book collecting even a modest passion. The necessary supple  ment he derived from tutoring private pupils, from consulting services as  an actuary and from an almost unending stream of articles contributed to  biographical dictionaries, historical series, composite works and encyclo-   2 Dictionary of National Biography; article on De Morgan.   3 Federigo Enriques, The Historic Development of Logic, 1929; pp. 115, 127-128.   4 Transactions Cambridge Philosophical Society, vol. X, 1864, p. 184.   5 Boole acknowledged the stimulus to his own investigations derived from De  Morgan's writings, and the latter unhesitatingly proclaimed that "the most striking  results ... in increasing the power of mathematical language," of binding together  the "two great branches of exact science, Mathematics and Logic" were the product  of "Dr. Boole's genius."

He wrote no less than one-sixth of the 850 articles in the famous  Penny Cyclopaedia. His main fields were astronomy, mathematics, physics  and biography and his subjects ranged from "abacus" (two articles) to  "Thomas Young." From 1831 to 1857 he had one article each year in the  Companions to the British Almanack, on such topics as chronology, deci  mal coinage, life insurance, bibliography and the history of science. The  selection which follows consists of excerpts from the Budget of Paradoxes,  a book published in 1872 after De Morgan's death. The Budget is a col  lection of articles, letters and reviews, most of which appeared first in  The Athenaeum. A paradox, in De Morgan's special sense of the word,  was any curious tale about science or scientists that he had come across  in his extensive reading, any piece of gossip, choice examples of lunacy,  assorted riddles and puns. Many of the articles deal with the attempts of  sundry zanies to square the circle, trisect the angle or construct a per  petual motion engine. The Budget is a dated book but some of the material  is amusing. The excerpts selected are among the better-known historical  entries.   De Morgan's unswerving adherence to principle deserves to be remem  bered. On several critical occasions in his life he courageously renounced  self-advantage and chose to follow the thorny road rather than trim his  convictions. After thirty years of service at the university he resigned his  professorship on an issue of sectarian freedom in which he personally was  not involved: the council had refused to appoint a Unitarian minister to  the chair of logic and philosophy. "It is unnecessary," he wrote the chair  man of the council, "for me to settle when I shall leave the college; for  the college has left me." He declined the offer of an honorary degree from  the University of Edinburgh, saying "he did not feel like an LL.D."; he  refused to let his name be posted for fellowship in the Royal Society  because it was "too much open to social influences" which was certainly  true in his time. A sentence in Ms will perhaps illustrates best the prin  ciples by which he lived: "I commend my future with hope and confidence  to Almighty God; to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom I  believe in my heart to be the Son of God but whom I have not confessed  with my lips, because in my time such confession has always been the  way up in the world,"     The riddle does not exist.

SHAKESPEARE     1 Assorted Paradoxes   By AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN   MATHEMATICAL THEOLOGY   Theologiae Christianas Principia Mathematica. Auctore Johanne  Craig. 1 London, 1699, 4to.   THIS is a celebrated speculation, and has been reprinted abroad, and  seriously answered. Craig is known in the early history of fluxions, and  was a good mathematician. He professed to calculate, on the hypothesis  that the suspicions against historical evidence increase with the square of  the time, how long it will take the evidence of Christianity to die out.  He finds, by formulae, that had it been oral only, it would have gone out  A. D. 800; but, by aid of the written evidence, it will last till A. D. 3150.  At this period he places the second coming, which is deferred until the  extinction of evidence, on the authority of the question "When the Son  of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?" It is a pity that Craig's  theory was not adopted: it would have spared a hundred treatises on the  end of the world, founded on no better knowledge than his, and many  of them falsified by the event. The most recent (October, 1863) is a tract  in proof of Louis Napoleon being Antichrist, the Beast, the eighth Head,  etc.; and the present dispensation is to close soon after 1864.   In order rightly to judge Craig, who added speculations on the varia  tions of pleasure and pain treated as functions of time, it is necessary to  remember that in Newton's day the idea of force, as a quantity to be  measured, and as following a law of variation, was very new: so likewise  was that of probability, or belief, as an object of measurement. The suc  cess of the Principia of Newton put it into many heads to speculate about   1 John Craig (died in 1731) was a Scotchman, but most of his life was spent at  Cambridge reading and writing on mathematics. He endeavored to introduce the  Leibnitz differential calculus into England. His mathematical works include the  Methodus Figurarum . . .

Craig imitated Newton's title, and evidently thought he was  making a step in advance: but it is not every one who can plough with   Samson's heifer. .   It is likely enough that Craig took a hint, directly or indirectly, from  Mohammedan writers, who make a reply to the argument that the Koran  has not the evidence derived from miracles. They say that, as evidence of  Christian miracles is daily becoming weaker, a time must at last arrive  when it will fail of affording assurance that they were miracles at all:  whence would arise the necessity of another prophet and other miracles.  Lee the Cambridge Orientalist, from whom the above words are taken,  almost certainly never heard of Craig or his theory. This is Samuel Lee  (1783-1852), the young prodigy in languages. He was apprenticed to a  carpenter at twelve and learned Greek while working at the trade. Before  he was twenty-five he knew Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Samaritan, Persian,  and Hindustani. He later became Regius professor of Hebrew at Cam  bridge.   ON CURIOSITIES OF TT   The celebrated interminable fraction 3.14159 . . . , which the mathe  matician calls TT, is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter. But  it is thousands of things besides. It is constantly turning up in mathe  matics: and if arithmetic and algebra had been studied without geometry,  TT must have come in somehow, though at what stage or under what name  must have depended upon the casualties of algebraical invention. This will  readily be seen when it is stated that v is nothing but four times the series     ad infinitum. 2 It would be wonderful if so simple a series had but one  kind of occurrence. As it is, our trigonometry being founded on the circle,  IT first appears as the ratio stated. If, for instance, a deep study of probable   2 There are many similar series and products.

I have not gone into any detail of  all those cases in which the paradoxer finds out, by his unassisted acumen,  that results of mathematical investigation cannot be: in fact, this discovery  is only an accompaniment, though a necessary one, of his paradoxical  statement of that which must be. Logicians are beginning to see that the  notion of horse is inseparably connected with that of non-horse: that the  first without the second would be no notion at all. And it is clear that  the positive affirmation of that which contradicts mathematical demon  stration cannot but be accompanied by a declaration, mostly overtly made,  that demonstration is false. If the mathematician were interested in pun  ishing this indiscretion, he could make his denier ridiculous by inventing  asserted results which would completely take him in.   More than thirty years ago I had a friend, now long gone, who was a  mathematician, but not of the higher branches: he was, inter alia, thor  oughly up in all that relates to mortality, life assurance, &c. One day,  explaining to him how it should be ascertained what the chance is of the  survivors of a large number of persons now alive lying between given  limits of number at the end of a certain time, I came, of course upon  the introduction of TT, which I could only describe as the ratio of the  circumference of a circle to its diameter. "Oh, my dear friend! that must  be a delusion; what can the circle have to do with the numbers alive at  the end of a given time?" "I cannot demonstrate it to you; but it is  demonstrated." "Oh! stuff! I think you can prove anything with your  differential calculus: figment, depend upon it." I said no more; but, a few  days afterwards, I went to him and very gravely told him that I had dis  covered the law of human mortality in the Carlisle Table, of which he  thought very highly. I told him that the law was involved in this circum  stance. Take the table of expectation of life, choose any age, take its  expectation and make the nearest integer a new age, do the same with  that, and so on; begin at what age you like, you are sure to end at the  place where the age past is equal, or most nearly equal, to the expectation  to come. "You don't mean that this always happens?" "Try it." He did  try, again and again; and found it as I said. "This is, indeed, a curious  thing; this is a discovery." I might have sent him about trumpeting the  law of life: but I contented myself with informing him that the same  thing would happen with any table whatsoever in which the first column  goes up and the second goes down; and that if a proficient in the higher  mathematics chose to palm a figment upon him, he could do without  the circle: & corsaire, corsair e et demi? the French proverb says.  3 "To a privateer, a privateer and a half."     Augustus De Morgan  2372   THE OLD MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY   Among the most remarkable proofs of the diffusion of speculation was  the Mathematical Society, which flourished from 1717 to 1845. Its habitat  was Spitalfields, and I think most of its existence was passed in Crispin  Street. It was originally a plain society, belonging to the studious artisan.  The members met for discussion once a week; and I believe I am correct  in saying that each man had his pipe, his pot, and his problem. One of  their old rules was that, "If any member shall so far forget himself and  the respect due to the Society as in the warmth of debate to threaten or  offer personal violence to any other member, he shall be liable to immedi  ate expulsion, or to pay such fine as the majority of the members present  shall decide." But their great rule, printed large on the back of the title  page of their last book of regulations, was "By the constitution of the  Society, it is the duty of every member, if he be asked any mathematical  or philosophical question by another member, to instruct him in the plain  est and easiest manner he is able," We shall presently see that, in old  time, the rule had a more homely form.   I have been told that De Moivre 4 was a member of this Society. This  I cannot verify: circumstances render it unlikely; even though the French  refugees clustered in Spitalfields; many of them were of the Society,  which there is some reason to think was founded by them. But Dolland 5  Thomas Simpson, 6 Saunderson, 7 Crossley, and others of known name,  were certainly members. The Society gradually declined, and in 1845 was  reduced to nineteen members. An arrangement was made by which sixteen  of these members, who were not already in the Astronomical Society  became Fellows without contribution, all the books and other property of  the old Society being transferred to the new one. I was one of the com  mittee which made the preliminary inquiries, and the reason of the decline  was soon manifest. The only question which could arise was whether the   4 Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754), French refugee in London, poor, studying  under difficulties, was a man with tastes in some respects like those of De Morgan.  For one thing, he was a lover of books, and he had a good deal of interest in the  theory of probabilities to which De Morgan also gave much thought. His introduction  of imaginary quantities into trigonometry was an event of importance in the history  of mathematics, and the theorem that bears his name, (cos <f> 4- i sin <f>) n = cos n<f> +  i sin 0, is one of the most important ones in all analysis.   5 John Dolland (1706-1761), the silk weaver who became the greatest maker of  optical instruments in his time.   6 Thomas Simpson (1710-1761), also a weaver, taking his leisure from his loom at  Spitalfields to teach mathematics. His New Treatise on Fluxions (1737) was written  only two years after he began working in London, and six years later he was ap  pointed professor of mathematics at Woolwich. He wrote many works on mathematics  and Simpson's Formulas for computing trigonometric tables are still given in the  text-books.   7 Nicholas Saunderson (1682-1739), the blind mathematician. He lost his eyesight  through smallpox when only a year old. At the age of 25 he began lecturing at  Cambridge on the principles of the Newtonian philosophy. His Algebra, in two large  volumes, was long the standard treatise on the subject.     Assorted Paradoxes 2373   members of the society of working men for this repute still continued  were of that class of educated men who could associate with the Fellows  of the Astronomical Society on terms agreeable to all parties. We found  that the artisan element had been extinct for many years; there was not a  man but might, as to education, manners, and position, have become a  Fellow in the usual way. The fact was that life in Spitalfields had become  harder: and the weaver could only live from hand to mouth, and not up  to the brain. The material of the old Society no longer existed.   In 1798, experimental lectures were given, a small charge for admission  being taken at the door: by this hangs a tale and a song. Many years  ago, I found among papers of a deceased friend, who certainly never had  anything to do with the Society, and who passed all his life far from  London, a song, headed "Song sung by the Mathematical Society in  London, at a dinner given Mr. Fletcher, a solicitor, who had defended  the Society gratis." Mr. Williams, the Assistant Secretary of the Astronom  ical Society, formerly Secretary of the Mathematical Society, remembered  that the Society had had a solicitor named Fletcher among the members.  Some years elapsed before it struck me that my old friend Benjamin  Gompertz, 8 who had long been a member, might have some recollection  of the matter. The following is an extract of a letter from him (July 9 9  1861):   "As to the Mathematical Society, of which I was a member when only  18 years of age, [Mr. G. was born in 1779], having been, contrary to the  rules, elected under the age of 21. How I came to be a member of that  Society and continued so until it joined the Astronomical Society, and  was then the President was: I happened to pass a bookseller's small  shop, of second-hand books, kept by a poor taylor, but a good mathema  tician, John Griffiths. I was very pleased to meet a mathematician, and  I asked him if he would give me some lessons; and his reply was that I  was more capable to teach him, but he belonged to a society of mathe  maticians, and he would introduce me. I accepted the offer, and I was  elected, and had many scholars then to teach, as one of the rule was, if  a member asked for information, and applied to any one who could give  it, he was obliged to give it, or fine one penny. Though I might say much  with respect to the Society which would be interesting, I will for the  present reply only to your question. I well knew Mr. Fletcher, who was a  very clever and very scientific person. He did, as solicitor, defend an  action brought by an informer against the Society I think for 5,000/.  for giving lectures to tiie public in philosophical subjects [i.e., for un  licensed public exhibition with money taken at the doors]. I think the   8 Benjamin Gompertz (1779-1865) was debarred as a Jew from a university edu  cation. He studied mathematics privately and became president of the Mathematical  Society. De Morgan knew him professionally through the fact that he was prominent  in actuarial work.     Augustus De Morgan  2374   price for admission was one shilling, and we used to have, if I rightly  recollect, from two to three hundred visitors. Mr. Fletcher was successful  in his defence, and we got out of our trouble. There was a collection made  to reward his services, but he did not accept of any reward: and I think  we gave him a dinner, as you state, and enjoyed ourselves; no doubt with  astronomical songs and other songs; but my recollection does not enable  me to say if the astronomical song was a drinking song. I think the  anxiety caused by that action was the cause of some of the members'  death. [They had, no doubt, broken the law in ignorance; and by the sum  named, the informer must have been present, and sued for a penalty on  every shilling he could prove to have been taken]."   % I by no means guarantee that the whole song I proceed to give is what  was sung at the dinner: I suspect, by the completeness of the chain, that  augmentations have been made. My deceased friend was just the man to  add some verses, or the addition may have been made before it came into  his hands, or since his decease, for the scraps containing the verses passed  through several hands before they came into mine. We may, however,  be pretty sure that the original is substantially contained in what is given,  and that the character is therefore preserved. I have had myself to repair  damages every now and then, in the way of conjectural restoration of  defects caused by ill-usage.

Old times are changed, old manners gone!   There is a new Mathematical Society, and I am, at this present writing  (1866), its first President. We are very high in the newest developments,  and bid fair to take a place among the scientific establishments. Benjamin  Gompertz, who was President of the old Society when it expired, was the  link between the old and new body: he was a member of ours at his  death. But not a drop of liquor is seen at our meetings, except a decanter  of water: all our heavy is a fermentation of symbols; and we do not draw  it mild. There is no penny fine for reticence or occult science; and as to a  song! not the ghost of a chance.     ON SOME PHILOSOPHICAL ATHEISTS   With the general run of the philosophical atheists of the last century  the notion of a God was an hypothesis. There was left an admitted possi  bility that the vague somewhat which went by more names than one,  might be personal, intelligent, and superintendent. In the works of La  place, who is sometimes called an atheist from his writings, there is noth  ing from which such an inference can be drawn: unless indeed a Reverend  Fellow of the Royal Society may be held to be the fool who said in his  heart, etc., etc., if his contributions to the Philosophical Transactions go  no higher than nature. The following anecdote is well known in Paris,  but has never been printed entire.   Laplace once went in form to present some edition of his "Systeme du  Monde" to the First Consul, or Emperor. Napoleon, whom some wags     Assorted Paradoxes 2377   had told that this book contained no mention of the name of God, and  who was fond of putting embarrassing questions, received it with  "M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system  of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator." Laplace,  who, though the most supple of politicians, was as stiff as a martyr on  every point of his philosophy or religion (e.g., even under Charles X he  never concealed his dislike of the priests) , drew himself up and answered  bluntly, "Je n'avais pas besoin de cette hypothese-la," Napoleon, greatly  amused, told this reply to Lagrange, who exclaimed, "Ah! c'est une belle  hypothese; ga explique beaucoup de choses."   It is commonly said that the last words of Laplace were, "Ce que nous  connaissons est peu de chose; ce que nous ignorons est immense." This  looks like a parody on Newton's pebbles: the following is the true account;  it comes to me through one remove from Poisson. After the publication (in  1825) of the fifth volume of the Mecanique Celeste, Laplace became gradu  ally weaker, and with it musing and abstracted. He thought much on the  great problems of existence and often muttered to himself, Qu'est ce que  c'est que tout cela! After many alternations, he appeared at last so perma  nently prostrated that his family applied to his favorite pupil, M. Poisson,  to try to get a word from him. Poisson paid a visit, and after a few words  of salutation, said, "J'ai une bonne nouvelle a vous annoncer: on a regu  au Bureau des Longitudes une lettre d'Allemagne annongant que M. Bessel  a verifie par Tobservation vos decouvertes theoriques sur les satellites de  Jupiter." u Laplace opened his eyes and answered with deep gravity,  "Uhomme ne poursuit que des chimeres." 12 He never spoke again. His  death took place March 5, 1827.   The language used by the two great geometers illustrates what I have  said: a supreme and guiding intelligence apart from a blind rule called  nature of things was an hypothesis. The absolute denial of such a ruling  power was not in the plan of the higher philosophers: it was left for the  smaller fry. A round assertion of the non-existence of anything which  stands in the way is the refuge of a certain class of minds: but it succeeds  only with things subjective; the objective offers resistance. A philosopher  of the appropriative class tried it upon the constable who appropriated  him: I deny your existence, said he; Come along all the same, said the  unpsychological policeman.   Euler was a believer in God, downright and straightforward. The fol  lowing story is told by Thiebault, in his Souvenirs de vingt ans de sejour  a Berlin, published in his old age, about 1804. This volume was fully  received as trustworthy; and Marshall Mollendorff told the Due de   11 "I have some good news to tell you: at the Bureau of Longitudes they have just  received a letter from Germany announcing that M. Bessel has verified by observation  your theoretical discoveries on the satellites of Jupiter."   12 "Man follows only phantoms."     Augustus De Morgan  2378   Bassano in 1807 that it was the most veracious of books written by the  most honest of men. Thiebault says that he has no personal knowledge of  the truth of the story, but that it was believed throughout the whole of the  north of Europe. Diderot paid a visit to the Russian Court at the invitation  of the Empress. He conversed very freely, and gave the younger members  of the Court circle a good deal of lively atheism. The Empress was much  amused, but some of her councillors suggested that it might be desirable  to check these expositions of doctrine. The Empress did not like to put a  direct muzzle on her guest's tongue, so the following plot was contrived.  Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician was m possession of  an algebraical demonstration of the existence of God, and would give it  him before all the Court, if he desired to hear it. Diderot gladly consented:  though the name of the mathematician is not given, it was Euler. He  advanced towards Diderot, and said gravely, and in a tone of perfect  conviction: Monsieur, (a+b*)/n = x, done Dieu existe; repondez!  Diderot, to whom algebra was Hebrew, was embarrassed and disconcerted;  while peals of laughter rose on all sides. He asked permission to return to  France at once, which was granted.   CELEBRATED APPROXIMATIONS OF ir   The following is an extract from the English Cyclopaedia, Art. TABLES:  "1853. William Shanks, Contributions to Mathematics, comprising  chiefly the Rectification of the Circle to 607 Places of Tables, London,  1853. (QUADRATURE OF THE CIRCLE.) Here is a table, because it tabulates  the results of the subordinate steps of this enormous calculation as far as  527 decimals: the remainder being added as results only during the print  ing. For instance, one step is the calculation of the reciprocal of 601.5 601 ;  and the result is given. The number of pages required to describe these  results is 87. Mr. Shanks has also thrown off, as chips or splinters, the  values of the base of Napier's logarithms, and of its logarithms of 2, 3, 5,  10, to 137 decimals; and the value of the modulus .4342. ... to 136 deci  mals; with the 13th, 25th, 37th. ... up to the 721st powers of 2. These  tremendous stretches of calculation at least we so call them in our day  are useful in several respects; they prove more than the capacity of  this or that computer for labor and accuracy; they show that there is in  the community an increase of skill and courage. We say in the com  munity: we fully believe that the unequalled turnip which every now  and then appears in the newspapers is a sufficient presumption that the  average turnip is growing bigger, and the whole crop heavier. All who  know the history of the quadrature are aware that the several increases  of numbers of decimals to which TT has been carried have been indications  of a general increase in the power to calculate, and in courage to face     Asserted Paradoxes 2379   the labor. Here is a comparison of two different times. In the day of  Cocker, the pupil was directed to perform a common subtraction with a  voice-accompaniment of this kind: *7 from 4 I cannot, but add 10, 7  from 14 remains 7, set down 7 and carry 1; 8 and 1 which I carry is 9,  9 from 2 I cannot, etc.* We have before us the announcement of the  following table, undated, as open to inspection at the Crystal Palace,  Sydenham, in two diagrams of 7 ft. 2 in., by 6 ft. 6 in.: The figure 9  involved into the 912th power, and antecedent powers, or involutions,  containing upwards of 73,000 figures. Also, the proofs of the above, con  taining upwards of 146,000 figures. By Samuel Fancourt, of Mincing  Lane, London, and completed by him in the year 1837, at the age of  sixteen. N.B. The whole operation performed by simple arithmetic.' The  young operator calculated by successive squaring the 2d, 4th, 8th, etc.,  powers up to the 512th, with proof by division. But 511 multiplications  by 9, in the short (or 101) way, would have been much easier. The  2d, 32d, 64th, 128th, 256th, and 512th powers are given at the back of  the announcement. The powers of 2 have been calculated for many pur  poses. In Vol. II of his Magia Universalis Natures et Artis, Herbipoli,  1658, 4to, the Jesuit Caspar Schott having discovered, on some grounds  of theological magic, that the degrees of grace of the Virgin Mary were  in number the 256th power of 2, calculated that number. Whether or no  his number correctly represented the result he announced, he certainly  calculated it rightly, as we find by comparison with Mr. Shanks."   There is a point about Mr. Shanks's 608 figures of the value of v which  attracts attention, perhaps without deserving it It might be expected that,  in so many figures, the nine digits and the cipher would occur each about  the same number of times; that is, each about 61 times. But the fact stands  thus: 3 occurs 68 times; 9 and 2 occur 67 times each; 4 occurs 64 times;  1 and 6 occur 62 times each; occurs 60 times; 8 occurs 58 times; 5  occurs 56 times; and 7 occurs only 44 times. Now, if all the digits were  equally likely, and 608 drawings were made, it is 45 to 1 against the  number of sevens being as distant from the probable average (say 61)  as 44 on one side or 78 on the other. There must be some reason why  the number 7 is thus deprived of its fair share in the structure. Here is a  field of speculation in which two branches of inquirers might unite. There  is but one number which is treated with an unfairness which is incredible  as an accident; and that number is the mystic number sevenl If the  cyclometers and the apocalyptics would lay their heads together until  they come to a unanimous verdict on this phenomenon, and would publish  nothing until they are of one mind, they would earn the gratitude of their  race. I was wrong: it is the Pyramid-speculator who should have been  appealed to, A correspondent of my friend Prof. Piazzi Smyth notices that     Augustus De Morgan  2380   3 is the number of most frequency, and that 3% is the nearest approxi  mation to it in simple digits. Professor Smyth himself, whose word on  Egypt is paradox of a very high order, backed by a great quantity of  useful labor, the results of which will be made available by those who do  not receive the paradoxes, is inclined to see confirmation for some of his  theory in these phenomena.   HORNER'S METHOD   Homer's method begins to be introduced at Cambridge: it was pub-  lished in 1820. 1 remember that when I first went to Cambridge (in 1823)  I heard my tutor say, in conversation, there is no doubt that the true  method of solving equations is the one which was published a few years  ago in the Philosophical Transactions. I wondered it was not taught, but  presumed that it belonged to the higher mathematics. This Horner himself  had in his head: and in a sense it is true; for all lower branches belong to  the higher: but he would have stared to have been told that he, Horner,  was without a European predecessor, and in the distinctive part of his  discovery was heir-at-law to the nameless Brahmin Tartar Antenoa-  chian what you please who concocted the extraction of the square root.   It was somewhat more than twenty years after I had thus heard a  Cambridge tutor show sense of the true place of Homer's method, that  a pupil of mine who had passed on to Cambridge was desired by his  college tutor to solve a certain cubic equation one of an integer root of  two figures. In a minute the work and answer were presented, by Horner's  method. "How!" said the tutor, "this can't be, you know." "There is the  answer, Sir!" said my pupil, greatly amused, for my pupils learnt, not only  Horner's method, but the estimation it held at Cambridge. "Yes!" said the  tutor, "there is the answer certainly; but it stands to reason that a cubic  equation cannot be solved in this space." He then sat down, went through  a process about ten times as long, and then said with triumph: "There!  that is the way to solve a cubic equation!"   I think the tutor in this case was never matched, except by the country  organist. A master of the instrument went into the organ-loft during serv  ice, and asked the organist to let him play the congregation out; consent  was given. The stranger, when the time came, began a voluntary which  made the people open their ears, and wonder who had got into the loft:  they kept their places to enjoy the treat. When the organist saw this, he  pushed the interloper off the stool, with "You'll never play 'em out this  side Christmas." He then began his own drone, and the congregation  began to move quietly away. "There," said he, "that's the way to play  'em out!"   13 A method for approximating the real roots of an algebraic equation. The in  ventor was W. G. Horner (1773-1827), but the same numerical technique may, it is  said, have been known to the Chinese in the 13th century. ED.     Assorted Paradoxes 2381   BUFFON'S NEEDLE PROBLEM   The paradoxes of what is called chance, or hazard, might themselves  make a small volume. All the world understands that there is a long run,  a general average; but great part of the world is surprised that this general  average should be computed and predicted. There are many remarkable  cases of verification; and one of them relates to the quadrature of the  circle. I give some account of this and another. Throw a penny time after  time until head arrives, which it will do before long: let this be called a  set. Accordingly, H is the smallest set, TH the next smallest, then TTH,  &c. For abbreviation, let a set in which seven tails occur before head turns  up be T^H. In an immense number of trials of sets, about half will be H;  about a quarter TH; about an eighth, T^H. Buffon 14 tried 2,048 sets; and  several have followed him. It will tend to illustrate the principle if I give  all the results; namely, that many trials will with moral certainty show an  approach and the greater the greater the number of trials to that aver  age which sober reasoning predicts. In the first column is the most likely  number of the theory: the next column gives Buffon's result; the three  next are results obtained from trial by correspondents of mine. In each  case the number of trials is 2,048.

Conversely, from many trials we may form a guess at what  the average will be. Thus, in Buffon's experiment the 2,048 first throws of   14 Georges Louis Leclerc Buffon (1707-1788), the well-known biologist He also  experimented with burning mirrors, his results appearing in his Invention des miroirs  ardens pour bruler a une grande distance (1747). The reference here may be to his  Resolution des problemes qui regardent le jeu du franc carreau (1733). The promi  nence of his Histoire naturelle (36 volumes, 1749-1788) has overshadowed the credit  due to him for his translation of Newton's work on Fluxions.     Augustus De Mor&an   the sets gave head in 1,061 cases: we have a right to infer that in the long  run something like 1,061 out of 2,048 is the proportion of heads, even  before we know the reasons for the equality of chance, which tell us that  1,024 out of 2,048 is the real truth. I now come to the way in which such  considerations have led to a mode in which mere pitch-and-toss has given  a more accurate approach to the quadrature of the circle than has been  reached by some of my paradoxers. The method is as follows: Suppose a  planked floor of the usual kind, with thin visible seams between the planks.  Let there be a thin straight rod, or wire, not so long as the breadth of the  plank. This rod, being tossed up at hazard, will either fall quite clear of the  seams, or will lay across one seam. Now Buffon, and after him Laplace,  proved the following: That in the long run the fraction of the whole num-  tjer of trials in which a seam is intersected will be the fraction which twice  the length of the rod is of the circumference of the circle having the breadth  of a plank for its diameter. In 1855 Mr. Ambrose Smith, of Aberdeen,  made 3,204 trials with a rod three-fifths of the distance between the  planks: there were 1,213 clear intersections, and 11 contacts on which it  was difficult to decide. Divide these contacts equally, and we have 1,218%  to 3,204 for the ratio of 6 to 577, presuming that the greatness of the  number of trials gives something near to the final average, or result in  the long run: this gives n = 3.1553. If all the 11 contacts had been treated  as intersections, the result would have been TT = 3.1412, exceedingly near.  A pupil of mine made 600 trials with a rod of the length between the  seams, and got TT = 3.137.   This method will hardly be believed until it has been repeated so often  that "there never could have been any doubt about it."   The first experiment strongly illustrates a truth of the theory, well con  firmed by practice: whatever can happen will happen if we make trials  enough. Who would undertake to throw tail eight times running? Never  theless, in the 8,192 sets tail 8 times running occurred 17 times; 9 times  running, 9 times; 10 times running, twice; 11 times and 13 times, each  once; and 15 times twice.     COMMENTARY ON   A Romance of Many Dimensions     A BOUT sixty years ago the Rev. Edwin Abbott Abbott, M.A., D.D.,  /X headmaster of the City of London School, published a small book  of mathematics fiction entitled Flatland. This tale was as much off Abbott's  beat as Alice was off the beat of the Rev. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson.  Abbott was reputed a classics scholar; among his writings, which were  well received, were Through Nature to Christ, The Anglican Career oj  Cardinal Newman and a less edifying but undoubtedly more profitable  item called How to Tell the Parts of Speech. His published works number  more than forty, but Flatland is, I dare say, his only hedge against obliv  ion. And even there opinions differ.   Flatland carries the subtitle "A Romance of Many Dimensions," which  is a fair description. It deals with a world of two dimensions, a plane,  inhabited by intelligent beings "who have no faculties by which they can  become conscious of anything outside their space and no means of moving  off the surface on which they live." Flatlanders are small plane figures,  the shape of each person depending on his social status. Women, being at  the bottom of the hierarchy, are straight lines; soldiers and the "lowest  class of workmen" are triangles; the middle class consists of equilateral  triangles; professional men and gentlemen are squares and so on up the  polygonal ladder, until one arrives at the priestly order, the members of  which are so many-sided, and the sides so small that the figures cannot  be distinguished from circles. The story is told in the first person by "A  Square" Dr. Abbott, I presume who has the misfortune one day to be  descended upon by a sphere, a visitor from the third dimension. In Flat-  land, of course, the sphere can be seen only as a circle, first increasing in  size (from a point) and then decreasing and finally vanishing as the sphere  passes through the plane. The sphere makes a number of descents and  stays long enough to describe to "A Square" the wonders of Spaceland  and to make him realize the wretchedness of being confined to the plane.  At last the stranger takes the Flatlander on a voyage into three-dimen-  jonal space. When he returns he is eager to instruct others in the newly  revealed theory of three dimensions, but is promptly denounced by the  priests as a heretic, sentenced to "perpetual imprisonment" and cast into  jail. There, fortunately, the story ends.   On its first appearance Flatland received what is known as a mixed  press. The dust jacket of my copy (a 1941 reprint) records opinions that  the book is "desperately facetious," "mortally tedious," "prolix," a  "soporific"; also that it is "clever," "fascinating," "mind broadening," and   2383     2384 Editor's Comment   worthy of a place beside Gulliver. All the reviewers were right, I think,  except the extremists: the Rev. Abbott's whimsey is not "meaningless,"  but neither does it make him a peer of the Rev. Swift Flatland is too long,  most of its jokes are not funny, and its didacticism is awful. Yet it is  based on an original idea, is not without charm and suggests certain  remarkably prophetic analogies applicable to relativity theory. 1 The mate  rial I have selected gives a taste of the whole; the book is still in print if  you care to learn more.   1 An anonymous letter published in Nature (the famous British scientific journal)  on February 12, 1920, entitled "Euclid, Newton and Einstein," calls attention to the  prophetic nature of Flatland. I quote a few lines: "[Dr. Abbott] asks the reader, who  has consciousness of the third dimension, to imagine a sphere descending upon the  plane of Flatland and passing through it. How will the inhabitants regard this phe  nomenon? .... Their experience will be that of a circular obstacle gradually ex  panding or growing, and then contracting, and they will attribute to growth in time  what the external observer in three dimensions assigns to motion in the third dimen  sion. Transfer this analogy to a movement of the fourth dimension through three-  dimensional space. Assume the past and future of the universe to be all depicted in  four-dimensional space and visible to any being who has consciousness of the fourth  dimension. If there is motion of our three-dimensional space relative to the fourth  dimension, all the changes we experience and assign to the flow of time will be due  simply to this movement, the whole of the future as well as the past always existing  in the fourth dimension," (See the introduction to the 1941 edition of Flatland by  William Garnett.)

ABBOTT   OF THE NATURE OF FLATLAND   I CALL our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but to make its  nature clearer to you, my happy readers, who are privileged to live in  Space.   Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles,  Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining  fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface, but without  the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows  only hard and with luminous edges and you will then have a pretty  correct notion of my country and countrymen. Alas! a few years ago, I  should have said "my universe"; but now my mind has been opened to  higher views of things.   In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that  there should be anything of what you call a "solid" kind; but I dare say  you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the Triangles,  Squares, and other figures moving about as I have described them. On the  contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least so as to distinguish  one figure from another. Nothing was visible, nor could be visible, to us,  except straight Lines; and the necessity of this I will speedily demonstrate.   Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and leaning  over it, look down upon it. It will appear a circle.   But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your  eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the  inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and  more oval to your view; and at last when you have placed your eye  exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually a  Flatland citizen) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all, and  will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.   The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way a   2385     Edwin A. Abbott  2386   Triangle, or Square, or any other figure cut out of pasteboard As soon  as you look at it with your eye on the edge of the table, you will find that  it ceases to appear to you a figure, and that it becomes in appearance a  straight line. Take for example an equilateral Triangle-who represents      FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 FIGURE 3   with us a Tradesman of the respectable class. Figure 1 represents the  Tradesman as you would see him while you were bending over him from  above; Figures 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman, as you would see him  if your eye were close to the level, or all but on the level of the table; and  if your eye were quite on the level of the table (and that is how we see  him in Flatland) you would see nothing but a straight line.   When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar  experiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant island  or coast lying on the horizon. The far-off land may have bays, forelands,  angles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a distance you see none  of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright upon them revealing the  projections and retirements by means of light and shade), nothing but a  gray unbroken line upon the water.   Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other  acquaintances comes towards us in Flatland. As there is neither sun with  us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none of the  helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland. If our friend comes close to  us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it becomes smaller: but  still he looks like a straight line; be he a Triangle, Square, Pentagon,  Hexagon, Circle, what you will a straight Line he looks and nothing  else.   You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantageous circumstances  we are able to distinguish our friends from one another: but the answer  to this very natural question will be more fitly and easily given when I  come to describe the inhabitants of Flatland. For the present let me defer  this subject, and say a word or two about the climate and houses in our  country.   OF THE CLIMATE AND HOUSES IN FLATLAND   As with you, so also with us, there are four points of the compass,  North, South, East, and West.     Flatten* 2387   There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is impossible for us to  determine the North in the usual way; but we have a method of our own.  By a Law of Nature with us, there is a constant attraction to the South;  and, although in temperate climates this is very slight so that even a  Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs northward with  out much difficulty yet the hampering effect of the southward attraction  is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most parts of our earth. More  over the rain (which falls at stated intervals) coming always from the  North, is an additional assistance; and in the towns we have the guidance  of the houses, which of course have their side-walls running for the most  part North and South, so that the roofs may keep off the rain from the  North. In the country, where there are no houses, the trunks of the trees  serve as some sort of guide. Altogether, we have not so much difficulty  as might be expected in determining our bearings.   Yet in our more temperate regions, in which the southward attraction is  hardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain where there  have been no houses nor trees to guide me, I have been occasionally com  pelled to remain stationary for hours together, waiting till the rain came  before continuing my journey. On the weak and aged, and especially on  delicate Females, the force of attraction tells much more heavily than on  the robust of the Male Sex, so that it is a point of breeding, if you meet  a Lady in the street, always to give her the North side of the way by no  means an easy thing to do always at short notice when you are in rude  health and in a climate where it is difficult to tell your North from your  South.   Windows there are none in our houses; for the light comes to us alike  in our homes and out of them, by day and by night, equally at all times  and in all places, whence we know not. It was in old days, with our  learned men, an interesting and oft-investigated question, What is the  origin of light; and the solution of it has been repeatedly attempted, with  no other result than to crowd our lunatic asylums with the would-be  solvers. Hence, after fruitless attempts to suppress such investigations indi  rectly by making them liable to a heavy tax, the Legislature, in compara  tively recent times, absolutely prohibited them. I, alas I alone in Flatland  know now only too well the true solution of this mysterious problem; but  my knowledge cannot be made intelligible to a single one of my country  men; and I am mocked at I, the sole possessor of the truths of Space  and of the theory of the introduction of Light from the world of Three  Dimensions as if I were the maddest of the mad! But a truce to these  painful digressions: let me return to our houses.   The most common form for the construction of a house is five-sided or  pentagonal, as in the annexed figure. The two Northern sides RO, OF,  constitute the roof, and for the most part have no doors; on the East is a     Edwin A. Abbott   2388   small door for the Women; on the West a much larger one for the Men;  the South side or floor is usually doorless.      FIGURE 4   Square and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason. The  angles of a Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle) being  much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of inanimate  objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men and Women,  it follows that there is no little danger lest the points of a square or tri  angular house residence might do serious injury to an inconsiderate or  perhaps absentminded traveller suddenly running against them: and there  fore, as early as the eleventh century of our era, triangular houses were  universally forbidden by Law, the only exceptions being fortifications,  powder-magazines, barracks, and other state buildings, which it is not  desirable that the general public should approach without circumspection.   At this period, square houses were still everywhere permitted, though  discouraged by a special tax. But, about three centuries afterwards, the  Law decided that in all towns containing a population above ten thousand,  the angle of a Pentagon was the smallest house angle that could be allowed  consistently with the public safety. The good sense of the community has  seconded the efforts of the Legislature; and now, even in the country, the  pentagonal construction has superseded every other. It is only now and  then in some very remote and backward agricultural district that an  antiquarian may still discover a square house.   CONCERNING THE INHABITANTS OF FLATLAND   The greatest length or breadth of a full-grown inhabitant of Flatland  may be estimated at about eleven of your inches. Twelve inches may be  regarded as a maximum.   Our Women are Straight Lines.   Our Soldiers and Lowest Classes of Workmen are Triangles with two     Flatten* 2389   equal sides, each about eleven inches long, and a base or third side so  short (often not exceeding half an inch) that they form at their vertices  a very sharp and formidable angle. Indeed when their bases are of the  most degraded type (not more than the eighth part of an inch in size),  they can hardly be distinguished from Straight Lines or Women; so  extremely pointed are their vertices. With us, as with you, these Triangles  are distinguished from others by being called Isosceles; and by this name  I shall refer to them in the following pages.   Our Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal-sided Triangles.   Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class I  myself belong) and Five-sided figures, or Pentagons.   Next above these come the Nobility, of whom there are several degrees,  beginning at Six-sided Figures, or Hexagons, and from thence rising in  the number of their sides till they receive the honorable title of Polygonal,  or many-sided. Finally when the number of the sides becomes so numer  ous, and the sides themselves so small that the figure cannot be distin  guished from a circle, he is included in the Circular or Priestly order;  and this is the highest class of all.   It is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have one more  side than his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule) one step  in the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a Square is a  Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on.   But this rule applies not always to the Tradesmen, and still less often  to the Soldiers, and to the Workmen; who indeed can hardly be said to  deserve the name of human Figures, since they have not all their sides  equal. With them therefore the Law of Nature does not hold; and the son  of an Isosceles (i.e., a Triangle with two sides equal) remains Isosceles  still. Nevertheless, all hope is not shut out, even from the Isosceles, that  his posterity may ultimately rise above his degraded condition. For, after  a long series of military successes, or diligent and skilful labors, it is  generally found that the more intelligent among the Artisan and Soldier  classes manifest a slight increase of their third side, or base, and a shrink  age of the two other sides. Intermarriages (arranged by the Priests)  between the sons and daughters of these more intellectual members of the  lower classes generally result in an offspring approximating still more to  the type of the Equal-sided Triangle.   Rarely in proportion to the vast number of Isosceles births is a genu  ine and certifiable Equal-sided Triangle produced from Isosceles parents. 1   1 "What need of a certificate?" a Spaceland critic may ask; "Is not the procreation  of a Square Son a certificate from Nature herself, proving the Equal-sidedness of the  Father?" I reply that no Lady of any position will marry an uncertified Triangle.  Square offspring has sometimes resulted from a slightly Irregular Triangle: but in  almost every such case the Irregularity of the first generation is visited on the third;  which either fails to attain the Pentagonal rank, or relapses to the Triangular.     Edwin A. Abbott     Such a birth requires, as its antecedents, not only a series of carefully  arranged intermarriages, but also a long-continued exercise of frugality  and self-control on the part of the would-be ancestors of the coming  Equilateral, and a patient, systematic, and continuous development of the  Isosceles intellect through many generations.   The birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents is the  subject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs round. After a strict  examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board, the infant, if  certified as Regular, is with solemn ceremonial admitted into the class of  Equilaterals. He is then immediately taken from his proud yet sorrowing  parents and adopted by some childless Equilateral, who is bound by oath  never to permit the child henceforth to enter his former home or so much  as to look upon his relations again, for fear lest the freshly developed  organism may, by force of unconscious imitation, fall back again into his  hereditary level.   The occasional emergence of an Isosceles from the ranks of his serf-  born ancestors, is welcomed not only by the poor serfs themselves, as a  gleam of light and hope shed upon the monotonous squalor of their exist  ence, but also by the Aristocracy at large; for all the higher classes are  well aware that these rare phenomena, while they do little or nothing to  vulgarize their own privileges, serve as a most useful barrier against  revolution from below.   Had the acute-angled rabble been all, without exception, absolutely  destitute of hope and of ambition, they might have found leaders in some  of their many seditious outbreaks, so able as to render their superior num  bers and strength too much even for the wisdom of the Circles. But a wise  ordinance of Nature has decreed that, in proportion as the working-classes  increase in intelligence, knowledge, and all virtue, in that same proportion  their acute angle (which makes them physically terrible) shall increase  also and approximate to the harmless angle of the Equilateral Triangle.  Thus, in the most brutal and formidable of the soldier class creatures  almost on a level with women in their lack of intelligence it is found  that, as they wax in the mental ability necessary to employ their tremen  dous penetrating power to advantage, so do they wane in the power of  penetration itself.   How admirable is this Law of Compensation! And how perfect a proof  of the natural fitness and, I may almost say, the divine origin of the  aristocratic constitution of the States in Flatland! By a judicious use of this  Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always able to stifle  sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage of the irrepressible and  boundless hopefulness of the human mind. Art also comes to the aid of  Law and Order. It is generally found possible by a little artificial com  pression or expansion on the part of the State physicians to make some     Flatland 2391   of the more intelligent leaders of a rebellion perfectly Regular, and to  admit them at once into the privileged classes; a much larger number,  who are still below the standard, allured by the prospect of being ulti  mately ennobled, are induced to enter the State Hospitals, where they are  kept in honorable confinement for life; one or two alone of the more  obstinate, foolish, and hopelessly irregular are led to execution.   Then the wretched rabble of the Isosceles, planless and leaderless, are  either transfixed without resistance by the small body of their brethren  whom the Chief Circle keeps in pay for emergencies of this kind; or else  more often, by means of jealousies and suspicions skilfully fomented  among them by the Circular party, they are stirred to mutual warfare, and  perish by one another's angles. No less than one hundred and twenty  rebellions are recorded in our annals, besides minor outbreaks numbered  at two hundred and thirty-five; and they have all ended thus.     HOW I TRIED TO TEACH THE THEORY OF THREE DIMENSIONS  TO MY GRANDSON, AND WITH WHAT SUCCESS   I awoke rejoicing, and began to reflect on the glorious career before  me. I would go forth, me-thought, at once, and evangelize the whole of  Flatland. Even to Women and Soldiers should the Gospel of Three Dimen  sions be proclaimed. I would begin with my Wife.   Just as I had decided on the plan of my operations, I heard the sound  of many voices in the street commanding silence. Then followed a louder  voice. It was a herald's proclamation. Listening attentively, I recognized  the words of the Resolution of the Council, enjoining the arrest, imprison  ment, or execution of any one who should pervert the minds of the people  by delusions, and by professing to have received revelations from another  World.   I reflected. This danger was not to be trifled with. It would be better to  avoid it by omitting all mention of my Revelation, by proceeding on the  path of Demonstration which after all seemed so simple and so conclu  sive that nothing would be lost by discarding the former means. "Upward,  not Northward" was the clew to the whole proof. It had seemed to me  fairly clear before I fell asleep; and when I first awoke, fresh from my  dream, it had appeared as patent as Arithmetic; but somehow it did not  seem to me quite so obvious now. Though my Wife entered the room  opportunely just at that moment, I decided, after we had interchanged a  few words of commonplace conversation, not to begin with her.   My Pentagonal Sons were men of character and standing, and physi  cians of no mean reputation, but not great in mathematics, and, in that  respect, unfit for my purpose. But it occurred to me that a young and     ~ Edwin A. Abbott   docile Hexagon, with a mathematical turn, would be a most suitable pupil.  Why therefore not make my first experiment with my little precocious  Grandson, whose casual remarks on the meaning of 3 3 had met with the  approval of the Sphere? Discussing the matter with him, a mere boy, I  should be in perfect safety; for he would know nothing of the Proclama  tion of the Council; whereas I could not feel sure that my Sons so  greatly did their patriotism and reverence for the Circles predominate  over mere blind affection might not feel compelled to hand me over to  the Prefect, if they found me seriously maintaining the seditious heresy  of the Third Dimension.   But the first thing to be done was to satisfy in some way the curiosity  of my Wife, who naturally wished to know something of the reasons for  which the Circle had desired that mysterious interview, and of the means  by which he had entered our house. Without entering into the details of  the elaborate account I gave her, an account, I fear, not quite so consist  ent with truth as my Readers in Spaceland might desire, I must be con  tent with saying that I succeeded at last in persuading her to return  quietly to her household duties without eliciting from me any reference  to the World of Three Dimensions. This done, I immediately sent for my  Grandson; for, to confess the truth, I felt that all that I had seen and  heard was in some strange way slipping away from me, like the image of  a half-grasped tantalizing dream, and I longed to essay my skill in making  a first disciple.   When my Grandson entered the room I carefully secured the door.  Then, sitting down by his side and taking our mathematical tablets, or,  as you would call them, Lines, I told him we would resume the lesson of  yesterday. I taught him once more how a Point by motion in One Dimen  sion produces a Line, and how a straight Line in Two Dimensions pro  duces a Square. After this, forcing a laugh, I said, "And now, you scamp,  you wanted to make me believe that a Square may in the same way by  motion 'Upward, not Northward/ produce another figure, a sort of extra  Square in Three Dimensions. Say that again, you young rascal."   At this moment we heard once more the herald's "O yes! O yes!" out  side in the street proclaiming the Resolution of the Council. Young though  he was, my Grandson who was unusually intelligent for his age, and  bred up in perfect reverence for the authority of the Circles took in  the situation with an acuteness for which I was quite unprepared. He  remained silent till the last words of the Proclamation had died away,  and then, bursting into tears, "Dear Grandpapa," he said, "that was only  my fun, and of course I meant nothing at all by it; and we did not know  anything then about the new Law; and I don't think I said anything about  the Third Dimension; and I am sure I did not say one word about 'Up  ward, not Northward/ for that would be such nonsense, you know. How     FlatJtmd 2393   could a thing move Upward, and not Northward? Upward, and not North  ward! Even if I were a baby, I could not be so absurd as that. How silly  it is! Ha! ha! ha!"   "Not at all silly," said I, losing my temper; "here, for example, I take  this Square," and, at the word, I grasped a movable Square, which was  lying at hand "and I move it, you see, not Northward but yes, I move  it Upward that is to say, not Northward, but I move it somewhere not  exactly like this, but somehow " Here I brought my sentence to an inane  conclusion, shaking the Square about in a purposeless manner, much to  the amusement of my Grandson, who burst out laughing louder than ever,  and declared that I was not teaching him, but joking with him; and so  saying he unlocked the door and ran out of the room. Thus ended my first  attempt to convert a pupil to the Gospel of Three Dimensions.   HOW I THEN TRIED TO DIFFUSE THE THEORY OF THREE DIMENSIONS  BY OTHER MEANS, AND OF THE RESULT   My failure with my Grandson did not encourage me to communicate  my secret to others of my household; yet neither was I led by it to despair  of success. Only I saw that I must not wholly rely on the catch-phrase,  "Upward, not Northward," but must rather endeavor to seek a demon  stration by setting before the public a clear view of the whole subject;  and for this purpose it seemed necessary to resort to writing.   So I devoted several months in privacy to the composition of a treatise  on the mysteries of Three Dimensions. Only, with the view of evading the  Law, if possible, I spoke not of a physical Dimension, but of a Thought-  land whence, in theory, a Figure could look down upon Flatland and see  simultaneously the insides of all things, and where it was possible that  there might be supposed to exist a Figure environed, as it were, with six  Squares, and containing eight terminal Points. But in writing this book I  found myself sadly hampered by the impossibility of drawing such dia  grams as were necessary for my purpose; for of course, in our country of  Flatland, there are no tablets but Lines, and no diagrams but Lines, all  in one straight Line and only distinguishable by difference of size and  brightness; so that, when I had finished my treatise (which I entitled  "Through Flatland to Thoughtland") I could not feel certain that many  would understand my meaning.   Meanwhile my life was under a cloud. All pleasures palled upon me; all  sights tantalized and tempted me to outspoken treason, because I could  not but compare what I saw in Two Dimensions with what it really was  if seen in Three, and could hardly refrain from making my comparisons  aloud. I neglected my clients and my own business to give myself to the  contemplation of the mysteries which I had once beheld, yet which I     Edwin A. Abbott  2394   could impart to no one, and found daily more difficult to reproduce even  before my own mental vision. ,   One day, about eleven months after my return from Spaceland, I tried  to see a Cube with my eye closed, but failed; and though I succeeded  afterwards, I was not then quite certain (nor have I been ever afterwards)  that I had exactly realized the original. This made me more melancholy  than before, and determined me to take some step; yet what, I knew not.  I felt that I would have been willing to sacrifice my life for the Cause, if  thereby I could have produced conviction. But if I could not convince my  Grandson, how could I convince the highest and most developed Circles   in the land?   And yet at times my spirit was too strong for me, and I gave vent to  dangerous utterances. Already I was considered heterodox if not treason-  abb, and I was keenly alive to the dangers of my position; nevertheless I  could not at times refrain from bursting out into suspicious or half-  seditious utterances, even among the highest Polygonal and Circular soci  ety. When, for example, the question arose about the treatment of those  lunatics who said that they had received the power of seeing the insides  of things, I would quote the saying of an ancient Circle, who declared  that prophets and inspired people are always considered by the majority  to be mad; and I could not help occasionally dropping such expressions  as "the eye that discerns the interiors of things," and "the all-seeing land":  once or twice I even let fall the forbidden terms "the Third and Fourth  Dimensions." At last, to complete a series of minor indiscretions, at a  meeting of our Local Speculative Society held at the palace of the Prefect  himself, some extremely silly person having read an elaborate paper  exhibiting the precise reasons why Providence has limited the number of  Dimensions to Two, and why the attribute of omnividence is assigned to  the Supreme alone, I so far forgot myself as to give an exact account  of the whole of my voyage with the Sphere into Space, and to the Assem  bly Hall in our Metropolis, and then to Space again, and of my return  home, and of everything that I had seen and heard in fact or vision. At  first, indeed, I pretended that I was describing the imaginary experiences  of a fictitious person; but my enthusiasm soon forced me to throw off all  disguise, and finally, in a fervent peroration, I exhorted all my hearers to  divest themselves of prejudice and to become believers in the Third  Dimension.   Need I say that I was at once arrested and taken before the Council?   Next morning, standing in the very place where but a very few months  ago the Sphere had stood in my company, I was allowed to begin and to  continue my narration unquestioned and uninterrupted. But from the first  I foresaw my fate; for the President, noting that a guard of the better sort  of Policemen was in attendance, of angularity little, if at all, under 55,     Flatland 2395   ordered them to be relieved before I began my defence, by an inferior  class of 2 or 3 C . I knew only too well what that meant. I was to be  executed or imprisoned, and my story was to be kept secret from the world  by the simultaneous destruction of the officials who had heard it; and,  this being the case, the President desired to substitute the cheaper for the  more expensive victims.   After I had concluded my defence, the President, perhaps perceiving  that some of the junior Circles had been moved by my evident earnestness,  asked me two questions:   1. Whether I could indicate the direction which I meant when I used  the words "Upward, not Northward'*?   2. Whether I could by any diagrams or descriptions (other than the  enumeration of imaginary sides and angles) indicate the Figure I was  pleased to call a Cube?   I declared that I could say nothing more, and that I must commit myself  to the Truth, whose cause would surely prevail in the end.   The President replied that he quite concurred in my sentiment, and  that I could not do better. I must be sentenced to perpetual imprisonment;  but if the Truth intended that I should emerge from prison and evangelize  the world, the Truth might be trusted to bring that result to pass. Mean  while I should be subjected to no discomfort that was not necessary to  preclude escape, and, unless I forfeited the privilege by misconduct, I  should be occasionally permitted to see my brother, who had preceded me  to my prison.   Seven years have elapsed and I am still a prisoner, and if I except the  occasional visits of my brother debarred from all companionship save  that of my jailers. My brother is one of the best of Squares, just, sensible,  cheerful, and not without fraternal affection; yet I must confess that my  weekly interviews, at least in one respect, cause me the bitterest pain. He  was present when the Sphere manifested himself in the Council Chamber;  he saw the Sphere's changing sections; he heard the explanation of the  phenomena then given to the Circles. Since that time, scarcely a week has  passed during seven whole years, without his hearing from me a repetition  of the part I played in that manifestation, together with ample descrip  tions of all the phenomena in Spaceland, and the arguments for the exist  ence of Solid things derivable from Analogy. Yet I take shame to be  forced to confess it my brother has not yet grasped the nature of the  Third Dimension, and frankly avows his disbelief in the existence of a  Sphere.   Hence I am absolutely destitute of converts, and, for aught that I can  see, the millennial Revelation has been made to me for nothing. Prome  theus up in Spaceland was bound for bringing down fire for mortals, but  I poor Flatland Prometheus lie here in prison for bringing down noth-     2396 Edwin A. Abbott   ing to my countrymen. Yet I exist in the hope that these memoirs, in some  manner, I know not how, may find their way to the minds of humanity in  Some Dimension, and may stir up a race of rebels who shall refuse to be  confined to limited Dimensionality.   That is the hope of my brighter moments. Alas, it is not always so.  Heavily weighs on me at times the burdensome reflection that I cannot  honestly say I am confident as to the exact shape of the once-seen, oft-  regretted Cube; and in my nightly visions the mysterious precept, "Up  ward, not Northward," haunts me like a soul-devouring Sphinx. It is part  of the martyrdom which I endure for the cause of the Truth that there are  seasons of mental weakness, when Cubes and Spheres flit away into the  background of scarce-possible existences; when the Land of Three Dimen  sions seems almost as visionary as the Land of One or None; nay, when  even this hard wall that bars me from my freedom, these very tablets on  which I am writing, and all the substantial realities of Flatland itself,  appear no better than the offspring of a diseased imagination, or the  baseless fabric of a dream.     COMMENTARY ON   LEWIS CARROLL     THE Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was a mediocre mathema  tician who taught at Oxford for twenty-seven years without brighten  ing the hour of a single student or producing anything of lasting value to  his subject. Making in his own person no claim on men's remembrance,  he created an immortal alter ego. I need not celebrate the famous Lewis  Carroll writings, but should point out that Dodgson's love of mathematics  and his preoccupation with certain of its concepts had much to do with  the shape his fantasies took. Especially is this true of Through the Looking  Glass, whose dreamlike inversions anticipate some of the most astounding  and revolutionary insights of twentieth-century mathematics and physics.  Modern writers have not overlooked the prophetic character of these re  markable stories. In serious treatises and in popularizations scientists  repeatedly borrow from the recorded wisdom of Carroll's notable com  pany of philosophers: the Red Queen, Humpty-Dumpty, the White  Knight, Tweedledum and Tweedledee.   For this book I have selected three less familiar examples of Dodgson's  writings. They too exhibit his interest in mathematical and logical prob  lems. Cast characteristically in the form of puzzles, they have an inimitable  quality, a blend of subtlety, pixieness and guileful innocence. No less than  his masterpieces, they make us wonder what extraordinary sort of man  he was.   Dodgson was born at Daresbury in 1832, the eldest son and the third  child in a family of eleven, all of whom stammered. 1 His father was a  comfortably off clergyman who rose to be an archdeacon. As a child,  Dodgson displayed a "quaint precocity," which included a premature  concern for the meaning of logarithms,- a propensity for staging mari  onette and magic shows and a gift for inventing puzzles. Like other chil  dren he made pets of snails and toads, but in a perverse innovation of his  own he tried to get earthworms to fight each other. For this purpose, it  is said, he supplied them with weapons, but the attempts were unsuccess  ful. After early schooling at home, when his father inculcated an interest   1 The sources of this sketch include the article on Dodgson in the Dictionary oj  National Biography, A. L. Taylor, The White Knight, Edinburgh, 1952; Florence  Becker Lennon.

His father smilingly told him he was much too young  to understand so difficult a subject. 'But,* said young Dodgson, with devastating  simplicity, 'please explain.' " Taylor, op. c/f., pp. 1-2.   2397     Editor's Comment  2398   in mathematics and theology, he went to a private school at Richmond and  then to Rugby. He was a good student, exceptional in mathematics and  "Divinity," and creditable in classics. But being an "odd fish" he was not  happy at Rugby. "I cannot say," he afterwards wrote, ". . . that any  earthly consideration could induce me to go through my three years  again." He took refuge in literary work which began by his writing and  illustrating numerous magazines for his home circle, among them Misch-  Masch and The Rectory Umbrella. The latter publication has whimsical  articles on mathematical and other puzzles including the riddle of the two  clocks, reproduced below, and an essay called "A Hemispherical Prob  lem," or "Where Does the Day Change Its Name." This was a real  problem. The day changes its name on the International Date Line, but  this demarcation was not invented until 1878, more than twenty-five years  after the question troubled Dodgson. He was always fascinated by time  and some of the wonderful topsy-turvy effects in his later writings were  produced by tinkering with it.   In January 1851 Dodgson entered Christ Church College, Oxford. He  stayed there for forty-seven years until his death. He won scholarships  and became, in recognition of his diligence and piety, a "Prick-bill" a  sort of chapel monitor who checked off attendance by pricking a hole  next to each of the names on a list. He took his B.A. and M.A. degrees  with honors, was appointed to the teaching staff, and in 1861 was  ordained Deacon of the Church of England. Dodgson never proceeded  to priest's orders and even his ordainment was preceded by years of self-  searching and misgivings. His bad stammer and his doctrinal doubts  were not the only things in the way of becoming a vicar. He liked being  a mathematician, even though he was not very good at it; moreover he  was reluctant to commit himself to some of the very strict rules imposed  by custom on those who took priests' orders. He could not have gone to  the theater 4 and he was determined not to relinquish this innocent  enjoyment.   It has also been suggested that behind Dodgson's refusal to take orders  lay a hidden desire hidden even from himself to marry. I suspect this  is the sort of thing interpretative biographers dream up; there is no real  evidence to sustain it beyond the general notion that every maiden aunt is  the victim of a great disappointment, following which she forever  renounces physical love.   Except for a six-week trip to the Continent (1867), in the course of  which he visited Russia, there was little to interrupt Dodgson's "half-  cloistral, fastidious, eccentric life." 5 He was a student always and a   3 Quoted by Taylor, op. cit., p. 3.   4 A. L. Taylor, op. cit., p. 24.   s Dictionary of National Biography,     Lewis Carroll 2399   teacher for twenty-seven of his middle years. 6 He was a writer of letters  on public questions to newspapers, and a participant in many Oxford  controversies. He was a "dreadfully conscientious" and rather dull instruc  tor. In the summer he went on short vacations to English bathing resorts.  He came up to London occasionally to see a play. He lectured to children,  using lantern slides of his own devising, made a mechanical Humpty-  Dumpty, accumulated a library of 5,000 volumes (from Shakespeare to  Kipling), bought a skeleton so as to learn anatomy, rigged up his rooms  with thermometers and oil stoves because he had a horror of drafts, had  five sizes of notepaper, conducted a prodigious correspondence which he  cross-indexed to the extent of having almost 100,000 entries in 1898, and  became one of the best amateur photographers of his time. He also went  rowing on the Isis with the small daughters of the Dean of Christ Church.  In his diary for July 4, 1862, appears the entry: "I made an expedition up  the river to Godstow with the three Liddells; we had tea on the bank  there, and did not reach Christ Church till half-past eight." On the oppo  site page (says Collingwood), he added, "somewhat later," the words,  "on which occasion I told them the fairy-tale of Alice's Adventures  Underground, which I undertook to write out for Alice." 7   It is of course a myth that Alice was composed in a single afternoon.  There were many river excursions and picnics with baskets of cake, cold  chicken and a kettle for tea, though it is perhaps true that the Godstow  outing was a specially magic day. 8 There were other story-telling hours  when the Liddells visited him to be photographed or to have lunch in  his unbelievably commodious suite at Christ Church (no less than four  bedrooms and four sitting rooms were occupied by him for thirty years).  Alice was published in 1865, Through the Looking Glass, seven years  later. Both were immensely successful. They brought Dodgson fame,  which he enjoyed, and made him the object of public attention and curi  osity, which terrified him. They also gave him modest wealth, which he  used in his own way by lending to impecunious friends, giving to hospitals  and other charities, presenting young nephews and nieces with gold  watches (and instructing them in symbolic logic) 9 and providing for the  amusement and even the education of the numerous tribe of little girls  he adored. From the fact that Dodgson was never a serious candidate for   6 Florence Becker Lennon, op. cit., p. 44.   7 Collingwood, op. cit., p. 93, as cited in Taylor, op. cit., p. 41.   8 "The importance of the Godstow trip was that on it he told a particularly good  story and Alice asked him to write it out for her. This is confirmed by Canon Duck  worth, who says: 'I also well remember how, when we had conducted the three chil  dren back to the Deanery, Alice said, as she bade us good night, "Oh, Mr. Dodgson,  I wish you would write out Alice's adventures for me." He said he should try, and  he afterwards told me that he sat up nearly the whole night, committing to a ms.  book his recollections of the drolleries with which he had enlivened the afternoon.* "  Taylor, op. cit., p. 43.   9 A. L. Taylor, op. cit., p. 200.     Editor's Comment     marriage one must not infer that he was incapable of love. He was in  capable, it is true, of giving love to adults, or at least of showing it. Even  when writing to his sisters he signed himself "C. L. Dodgson." But with  little girls he could be natural and warm, invite them to parties, play  games tirelessly, invent for their entertainment endless puzzles and stories.  I think there is point to the conjecture that on a deeper level his two  great books were allegories in which are fused two themes: his undeclared  love for Alice Liddell and his fascination with the mathematical mysteries  of time. 10   "He always used to say that when the time came for him to take off  his hat when he met one of his quondam child friends in the street, it  was time for the friendship to cease." n Alice grew up, got married and  the friendship ceased; inspiration also ceased. The Hunting of the Snark  appeared in 1876; it was the last of the writings in which Dodgson suc  ceeded in creating what has aptly been called a new nursery mythology.  Sylvie and Bruno (1889), also a book for children (and also an allegory)  is much inferior. Nevertheless many works, mathematical as well as liter  ary and fanciful, still came from his pen. His total output, before and  after Alice, was quite large. As C. L. Dodgson, he published, among  others, numerous mathematical texts, a book on non-Euclidean geometry  (Euclid and His Modern Rivals, 1879), mathematical curiosa, and vol  umes on symbolic logic. These were useful works, and his studies of  formal logic exhibited fully his "acute and ingenious intellect." But his  contributions in mathematics and logic cannot be assessed as of more  than limited value. As Lewis Carroll (the pseudonym which he adopted  in 1856 when he wrote verse for a magazine called The Train) 12 he wrote  many poems, pamphlets on university affairs, articles on various subjects  ranging from logical paradoxes to vivisection, and a book on symbolic  logic.   As he grew older, Dodgson became fussier, more prudish and more  difficult. Sir John Tenniel who had almost as, much to do with bringing  Alice to life as the author, said he could no longer tolerate "that con  ceited old don." 13 His close friend Ellen Terry had to submit to his  rebuke for taking off a few outer garments as required while playing the  role of Margaret in Faust. (This rebuke makes an interesting contrast  with Dodgson's frequent practice of photographing little girls in his cham  bers in the nude.) More and more he fled from the sensible world into  a land of games, puzzles, mnemonics, circle squarers and logical paradoxes.   10 See A. L. Taylor, op. cit.   11 Ethel Arnold (Matthew Arnold's niece), one of Dodgson's "quondam child  friends," as quoted in Florence Becker Lennon, op. cit., p. 207.   12 One of the poems in Through the Looking Glass, the White Knight's mournful  ballad, appeared in The Train in 1856.

Levfis Carroll 2401   Endless suggestions poured from him for improving things "like lawn  tennis tournaments and the election of proctors," A chronic insomniac,  but otherwise in excellent health, he found ample time to pursue every  harmless whim to its insanely logical conclusion. He had the habit of  working throughout the night while standing at his tall writing desk; "he  also worked in bed without light, using an instrument of his own invention  called the nyctograph," which kept the lines straight and his pen from  running off the paper. 14 On January 6, 1898, he contracted influenza,  and eight days later he died. Dodgson once said in a letter to a friend  in America: "words mean more than we mean to express when we use  them; so a whole book ought to mean a great deal more than the writer  means." No more profound opinion has been uttered on his own strange  masterpieces. 15   14 Taylor, op. cit., p. 200.   15 For an interesting article on Carroll's contributions to mathematics, see Warren  Weaver, "Lewis Carroll: Mathematician," Scientific American, April 1956- [Note  added in proof.]     Logic is neither a science nor an art. but a dodge   BENJAMIN JOWETT (?)

"So you've got to the end of our race-course?" said the Tortoise. "Even  though it does consist of an infinite series of distances? I thought some  wiseacre or other had proved that the thing couldn't be done?"   "It can be done," said Achilles. "It has been done! Solvitur ambulando.  You see the distances were constantly diminishing: and so "   "But if they had been constantly increasing!" the Tortoise interrupted.  "How then?"   "Then I shouldn't be here:' Achilles modestly replied; "and you would  have got several times round the world, by this time!"   "You flatter me flatten, I mean," said the Tortoise; "for you are a  heavy weight, and no mistake! Well now, would you like to hear of a  race-course, that most people fancy they can get to the end of in two  or three steps, while it really consists of an infinite number of distances,  each one longer than the previous one?"   "Very much indeed!" said the Grecian warrior, as he drew from his  helmet (few Grecian warriors possessed pockets in those days) an enor  mous note-book and a pencil. "Proceed! And speak slowly, please! Short  hand isn't invented yet!"   "That beautiful First Proposition of Euclid!" the Tortoise murmured  dreamily. "You admire Euclid?"   "Passionately! So far, at least, as one can admire a treatise that won't  be published for some centuries to come!"   "Well, now, let's take a little bit of the argument in that First Proposi  tion just two steps, and the conclusion drawn from them. Kindly enter  them in your note-book. And, in order to refer to them conveniently,  let's call them A, B, and Z:   (A) Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other.   (B) The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to the  same.     2402     What the Tortoise Said to Achilles and Other Riddles 2403   (Z) The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other.   "Readers of Euclid will grant, I suppose, that Z follows logically from  A and #, so that any one who accepts A and B as true, must accept Z as  true?"   "Undoubtedly! The youngest child in a High School as soon as High  Schools are invented, which will not be till some two thousand years later  will grant that."   "And if some reader had not yet accepted A and B as true, he might  still accept the Sequence as a valid one, I suppose?"   "No doubt such a reader might exist. He might say 'I accept as true  the Hypothetical Proposition that, if A and B be true, Z must be true;  but I don't accept A and B as true.' Such a reader would do wisely in  abandoning Euclid, and taking to football."   "And might there not also be some reader who would say *I accept A  and B as true, but I don't accept the Hypothetical'?"   "Certainly there might. He, also, had better take to football."   "And neither of these readers," the Tortoise continued, "is as yet under  any logical necessity to accept Z as true?"   "Quite so," Achilles assented.   "Well, now, I want you to consider me as a reader of the second kind,  and to force me, logically, to accept Z as true."   "A tortoise playing football would be " Achilles was beginning.   " an anomaly, of course," the Tortoise hastily interrupted. "Don't  wander from the point. Let's have Z first, and football afterwards!"   "I'm to force you to accept Z, am I?" Achilles said musingly. "And  your present position is that you accept A and B, but you don't accept the  Hypothetical"   "Let's call it C" said the Tortoise.   " but you don't accept:   (C) If A and B are true, Z must be true."   "That is my present position," said the Tortoise.   "Then I must ask you to accept C."   'Til do so," said the Tortoise, "as soon as you've entered it in that  note-book of yours. What else have you got in it?"   "Only a few memoranda," said Achilles, nervously fluttering the leaves:  "a few memoranda of of the battles in which I have distinguished  myself!"   "Plenty of blank leaves, I see!" the Tortoise cheerily remarked. "We  shall need them a//!" (Achilles shuddered.) "Now write as I dictate:   (A ) Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other.   (B) The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same.   (C) If A and B are true, Z must be true.   (Z) The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other."     Lewis Carroll  2404   "You should call it D, not Z," said Achilles. "It comes next to the  other three. If you accept A and B and C, you must accept Z."   "And why must IT   "Because it follows logically from them. If A and B and C are true,  Z must be true. You don't dispute that, I imagine?"   "If A and B and C are true, Z murt be true," the Tortoise thought-  fully repeated. "That's another Hypothetical, isn't it? And, if I failed to  see its truth, I might accept A and B and C, and still not accept Z,   mightn't I?"   "You might," the candid hero admitted; "though such obtuseness would  certainly be phenomenal. Still, the event is possible. So I must ask you  to grant one more Hypothetical."   "Very good. I'm quite willing to grant it, as soon as you've written it  down. We will call it   (D) If A and B and C are true, Z must be true.   "Have you entered that in your note-book?"   "I haver Achilles joyfully exclaimed, as he ran the pencil into its  sheath. "And at last we've got to the end of this ideal race-course! Now  that you accept A and B and C and D> of course you accept Z."   "Do I?" said the Tortoise innocently, "Let's make that quite clear.  I accept A and B and C and D. Suppose I still refuse to accept Z?"   "Then Logic would take you by the throat, and force you to do it!"  Achilles triumphantly replied. "Logic would tell you 'You can't help  yourself. Now that you've accepted A and B and C and D, you must  accept zr So you've no choice, you see."   "Whatever Logic is good enough to tell me is worth writing down"  said the Tortoise. "So enter it in your book, please. We will call it  () If A and B and C and Z) are true, Z must be true.   "Until I've granted that, of course, I needn't grant Z. So it's quite a  necessary step, you see?"   "I see," said Achilles; and there was a touch of sadness in his tone.   Here the narrator, having pressing business at the Bank, was obliged  to leave the happy pair, and did not again pass the spot until some months  afterwards. When he did so, Achilles was still seated on the back of the  much-enduring Tortoise, and was writing in his notebook, which appeared  to be nearly full. The Tortoise was saying "Have you got that last step  written down? Unless I've lost count, that makes a thousand and one.  There are several millions more to come. And would you mind, as a  personal favour considering what a lot of instruction this colloquy of  ours will provide for the Logicians of the Nineteenth Century would  you mind adopting a pun that my cousin the Mock-Turtle will then make,  and allowing yourself to be re-named Taught-Us?"   "As you please!" replied the weary warrior, in the hollow tones of     What the Tortoise Said to Achilles and Other Riddles 2405   despair, as he buried his face in his hands. "Provided that you, for your  part, will adopt a pun the Mock-Turtle never made, and allow yourself  to be renamed A Kill-Ease!"     THE TWO CLOCKS   Which is better, a clock that is right only once a year, or a clock that  is right twice every day? "The latter," you reply, "unquestionably." Very  good, now attend.   I have two clocks: one doesn't go at all, and the other loses a minute a  day: which would you prefer? "The losing one," you answer, "without  a doubt." Now observe: the one which loses a minute a day has to lose  twelve hours, or seven hundred and twenty minutes before it is right  again, consequently it is only right once in two years, whereas the other  is evidently right as often as the time it points to come round, which  happens twice a day.   So you've contradicted yourself once.   "Ah, but," you say, "what's the use of its being right twice a day, if  I can't tell when the time comes?"   Why, suppose the clock points to eight o'clock, don't you see that the  clock is right at eight o'clock? Consequently, when eight o'clock comes  round your clock is right.   "Yes, I see that," you reply.   Very good, then you've contradicted yourself twice: now get out of the  difficulty as best you can, and don't contradict yourself again if you can  help it.   You might go on to ask, "How am I to know when eight o'clock does  come? My clock will not tell me." Be patient: you know that when eight  o'clock comes your clock is right, very good; then your rule is this: keep  your eye fixed on your clock, and the very moment it is right it will be  eight o'clock. "But ," you say. There, that'll do; the more you argue  the farther you get from the point, so it will be as well to stop.

"Didn't Balbus say this morning that, if a body is immersed in liquid  it displaces as much liquid as is equal to its own bulk?" said Hugh.   "He said things of that sort,'* Lambert vaguely replied.   'Weil, just look here a minute. Here's the little bucket almost quite  immersed: so the water displaced ought to be just about the same bulk.  And now just look at it!'* He took out the little bucket as he spoke, and  handed the big one to Lambert. "Why, there's hardly a teacupful! Do you  mean to say that water is the same bulk as the little bucket?"   "Course it is," said Lambert.   "Well, look here again!" cried Hugh, triumphantly, as he poured the  water from the big bucket into the little one. "Why, it doesn't half fill it!"   "That's its business," said Lambert. "If Balbus says it's the same bulk,  why, it 15 the same bulk, you know."   "Well, I don't believe it," said Hugh.   "You needn't," said Lambert. "Besides, it's dinner-time. Come along."   They found Balbus waiting dinner for them, and to him Hugh at once  propounded his difficulty.   "Let's get you helped first," said Balbus, briskly cutting away at the  joint. "You know the old proverb, 'Mutton first, mechanics afterwards'?"   The boys did not know the proverb, but they accepted it in perfect good  faith, as they did every piece of information, however startling, that came  from so infallible an authority as their tutor. They ate on steadily in  silence, and, when dinner was over, Hugh set out the usual array of pens,  ink, and paper, while Balbus repeated to them the problem he had pre  pared for their afternoon's task.   "A friend of mine has a flower-garden a very pretty one, though no  great size "   "How big is it?" said Hugh.   "That's what you have to find out!" Balbus gayly replied. "All / tell  you is that it is oblong in shape just half a yard longer than its width  and that a gravel-walk, one yard wide, begins at one corner and runs all  round it."   "Joining into itself?" said Hugh.   "Not joining into itself, young man. Just before doing that, it turns a  corner, and runs round the garden again, alongside of the first portion,  and then inside that again, winding in and in, and each lap touching the  last one, till it has used up the whole of the area."     What the Tortoise Said to Achilles and Other Riddles 2407   "Like a serpent with corners?" said Lambert.   "Exactly so. And if you walk the whole length of it, to the last inch,  keeping in the centre of the path, it's exactly two miles and half a furlong.  Now, while you find out the length and breadth of the garden, I'll see if  I can think out that sea-water puzzle."   "You said it was a flower-garden?" Hugh inquired, as Balbus was  leaving the room.   "I did," said Balbus.   "Where do the flowers grow?" said Hugh. But Balbus thought it best  not to hear the question. He left the boys to their problem, and, in the  silence of his own room, set himself to unravel Hugh's mechanical  paradox.   "To fix our thoughts," he murmured to himself, as, with hands deep-  buried in his pockets, he paced up and down the room, "we will take a  cylindrical glass jar, with a scale of inches marked up the side, and fill it  with water up to the 10-inch mark: and we will assume that every inch  depth of jar contains a pint of water. We will now take a solid cylinder,  such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to half a pint of water, and  plunge 4 inches of it into the water, so that the end of the cylinder comes  down to the 6-inch mark. Well, that displaces 2 pints of water. What  becomes of them? Why, if there were no more cylinder, they would lie  comfortably on the top, and fill the jar up to the 12-inch mark. But un  fortunately there is more cylinder, occupying half the space between the  10-inch and the 12-inch marks, so that only one pint of water can be  accommodated there. What becomes of the other pint? Why, if there  were no more cylinder, it would lie on the top, and fill the jar up to the  13-inch mark. But unfortunately Shade of Newton!" he exclaimed, in  sudden accents of terror. "When does the water stop rising?"   A bright idea struck him. "I'll write a little essay on it," he said.   BALBUS'S ESSAY   "When a solid is immersed in a liquid, it is well known that it displaces  a portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk, and that the level of the  liquid rises just so much as it would rise if a quantity of liquid had been  added to it, equal in bulk to the solid. Lardner says precisely the same  process occurs when a solid is partially immersed: the quantity of liquid  displaced, in this case, equalling the portion of the solid which is im  mersed, and the rise of the level being in proportion.   "Suppose a solid held above the surface of a liquid and partially  immersed: a portion of the liquid is displaced, and the level of the liquid  rises. But, by this rise of level, a little bit more of the solid is of course  immersed, and so there is a new displacement of a second portion of the     Lewis Carroll     liquid, and a consequent rise of level. Again, this second rise of level  causes a yet further immersion, and by consequence another displacement  of liquid and another rise. It is self-evident that this process must continue  till the entire solid is immersed, and that the liquid will then begin to  immerse whatever holds the solid, which, being connected with it, must  for the time be considered a part of it. If you hold a stick, six feet long,  with its ends in a tumbler of water, and wait long enough, you must  eventually be immersed. The question as to the source from which the  water is supplied which belongs to a high branch of mathematics, and  is therefore beyond our present scope does not apply to the sea. Let us  therefore take the familiar instance of a man standing at the edge of the  sea, at ebb-tide, with a solid in his hand, which he partially immerses:  he remains steadfast and unmoved, and we all know that he must be  drowned. The multitudes who daily perish in this manner to attest a  philosophical truth, and whose bodies the unreasoning wave casts sullenly  upon our thankless shores, have a truer claim to be called the martyrs of  science than a Galileo or a Kepler. To use Kossuth's eloquent phrase,  they are the unnamed demigods of the nineteenth century." 2   "There's a fallacy somewhere" he murmured drowsily, as he stretched  his long legs upon the sofa. "I must think it over again." He closed his  eyes, in order to concentrate his attention more perfectly, and for the  next hour or so his slow and regular breathing bore witness to the careful  deliberation with which he was investigating this new and perplexing view  of the stbject.   ANSWERS TO KNOT DC   1. THE BUCKETS   Problem. Lardner states that a solid, immersed in a fluid, displaces  an amount equal to itself in bulk. How can this be true of a small bucket  floating in a larger one?   Solution. Lardner means, by "displaces," "occupies a space which  might be filled with water without any change in the surroundings." If  the portion of the floating bucket, which is above the water, could be  annihilated and the rest of it transformed into water, the surrounding  water would not change its position: which agrees with Lardner's state  ment.   Five answers have been received, none of which explains the difficulty  arising from the well-known fact that a floating body is the same weight  as the displaced fluid. HECLA says that "Only that portion of the smaller  bucket which descends below the original level of the water can be   2 Note by the writer. For the above essay I am indebted to a dear friend, now  deceased.     What the Tortoise Said to Achilles and Other Riddles 2409   properly said to be immersed, and only an equal bulk of water is dis  placed." Hence, according to HECLA, a solid whose weight was equal to  that of an equal bulk of water, would not float till the whole of it was  below "the original level" of the water: but, as a matter of fact, it would  float as soon as it was all under water. MAGPIE says the fallacy is "the  assumption that one body can displace another from a place where it  isn't," and that Lardner' s assertion is incorrect, except when the contain  ing vessel "was originally full to the brim." But the question of floating  depends on the present state of things, not on past history, OLD KING  COLE takes the same view as HECLA. TYMPANUM and VINDEX assume  that "displaced" means "raised above its original level," and merely ex  plain how it comes to pass that the water, so raised, is less in bulk than  the immersed portion of bucket, and thus land themselves or rather set  themselves floating in the same boat as HECLA.  I regret that there is no Class List to publish for this Problem.   2. BALBUS'S ESSAY   Problem. Balbus states that if a certain solid be immersed in a certain  vessel of water, the water will rise through a series of distances, two  inches, one inch, half an inch, etc., which series has no end. He con  cludes that the water will rise without limit. Is this true?   Solution. No. This series can never reach 4 inches, since, however  many terms we take, we are always short of 4 inches by an amount equal  to the last term taken.   Three answers have been received but only two seem to me worthy  of honours.   TYMPANUM says that the statement about the stick "is merely a blind,  to which the old answer may well be applied, solvitur ambulando, or  rather mergendo" I trust TYMPANUM will not test this in his own person,  by taking the place of the man in Balbus's Essay! He would infallibly be  drowned.   OLD KING COLE rightly points out that the series, 2, 1, etc., is a decreas  ing geometrical progression: while VINDEX rightly identifies the fallacy  as that of "Achilles and the Tortoise."     COMMENTARY ON   Continuity     THE theory of continuity is an important and beautiful mathematical  fiction. Mathematics could not have got along without it, yet it Has  been the source of formidable difficulties. In mathematics continuity is  understood as being analogous to, but not identical with, the intuitive  idea of continuity associated with time, space or motion. We all think of  time, as did Newton, as flowing "equably" and unbrokenly; of space as  smooth and without gaps or fissures; of motion as uninterrupted, ^inter  mittent, "continuous." This is the natural, perhaps even indispensable,  mode of interpreting experience, for the plain man and the philosopher. 1  The mathematician, with characteristic perversity, redefines this comfort  ably vague notion, thereby making it more precise, more useful and more  troublesome.   I shall give two examples of mathematical continuity. The series of  real numbers composed of the rational and irrational numbers is con  tinuous; so is the class of points on a line segment. Each number or point  is separate and possesses its own distinguishable identity; "it does not  pass over by imperceptible degrees into another"; yet the series of numbers  (or class of points) is what mathematicians call "everywhere dense"  which means that between any two numbers (or points), however near  together, there is an infinitude of others. This is one of the essential attri  butes of the mathematical continuum. Another example of the concept  is the continuous function, an immensely valuable tool of pure and  applied mathematics. The modern definition of continuous function, upon  which mathematicians have lavished exquisite care, is very precise and  very technical; it will suffice here to say that a function is continuous if  its graph is a smooth curve, without sudden jumps or breaks.   The problems of continuity have for centuries vexed philosophers and  logicians, as well as mathematicians. Orie of the major problems stems  from Zeno's famous puzzles. Zeno showed that the mathematical treat  ment of space and time required that they be broken up into infinite  sets of points and instants; this, in turn, seemed to force the conclusion  that motion is impossible, and also to lead to other paradoxes. Philos  ophers were especially displeased because they felt that resolving space   1 "They [the plain man and the philosopher] conceive continuity rather as absence  of separateness, the sort of general obliteration of distinctions which characterizes a  thick fog. A fog gives an impression of vastness without multiplicity or division.  It is the sort of thing that a metaphysician means by 'continuity,' declaring it, very  truly, to be characteristic of his mental life and of that of children and animals."  Bertrand Russell, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, N. Y., 1930, p. 105.     2410     Continuity 2411   and time into points and instants destroyed the intuitive property of  continuity without furnishing a satisfactory substitute, 2 Imagine, they  said, living in a space bristling with an infinity of points; the idea of an  array of points implies discontinuity, however densely the points are  packed, and the very notion of infinite number is self-contradictory.   Some, but not all of these problems have been cleared up. It is now  understood that the theory of mathematical continuity is an "abstract  logical scheme" which may or may not describe the structure of actual  space, but whose validity is independent of such considerations. It is not  yet certain that Zeno's puzzles have finally been solved, but a logically  consistent theory of mathematical infinity has been devised which disposes  of part of the philosophical muddle. Among the principal founders of  this theory are George Cantor (see p. 1593), Richard Dedekind (see  p. 528) and Bernhard Bolzano (1781-1848), an Austrian Catholic priest,  whose posthumous little book, Paradoxes of the Infinite (1851) is a land  mark of modern mathematical and logical thought. Bolzano recognized  the necessity, in analyzing the paradoxes of infinity, of defining various  "obvious" mathematical concepts, including that of continuity. One of  the theorems in his book, on continuous function, reads as follows:   "A continuous function of a variable x which is positive for some value  of x and negative for some other value of x in a closed interval  a ^ x ^ b of continuity must have the value zero for some intermediate  value of jc." 8 You will readily perceive that this is almost as self-evident  a theorem as one which states that in ascending from the cellar to the  roof of a building it is necessary at some point to pass the street level  Yet certain of the mathematical implications of this simple and obvious  statement about continuity are utterly astonishng, as may be seen in the  small problem of mechanics given below. I suspect you will not believe  the solution, even after going through the proof; or that if you concede  the proof is without a logical flaw, you will still have to exert yourself to  feel the correctness of the solution. If you succeed in this effort, you may  call yourself a mathematician; in any case you will appreciate the subtlety  of the continuity concept and the depth of Bolzano's trivial theorem,   2 Bertrand Russell, Our Knowledge of the External World As a Field for Scien  tific Method in Philosophy, Open Court (Chicago), 1915, pp. 129 et seq.   3 As given in Courant and Robbins, What Is Mathematics?, New York, 1941, p. 312.  See also Bernhard Bolzano, Paradoxes of the Infinite, translated by Dr. Fr. P'nhonskyJ  with a historical introduction by Donald A. Steele, New Haven (Yale University  Press), 1950.     He hangs between; in doubt to act or rest. ALEXANDER POPE     4 The Lever of Mahomet   By RICHARD COURANT  and HERBERT ROBBINS     SUPPOSE a train travels in a finite time from station A to station B  along a straight section of track. The journey need not be of uniform  speed or acceleration. The train may act in any manner, speeding up,  slowing down, coming to a halt, or even backing up for a while, before  reaching B. But the exact motion of the train is supposed to be known  in advance; that is, the function s = /(f) is given, where s is the distance  of the train from station A, and t is the time, measured from the instant  of departure. On the floor of one of the cars a rod is pivoted so that it  may move without friction either forward or backward until it touches  the floor. (If it does touch the floor, we assume that it remains on the  floor henceforth; this will be the case if the rod does not bounce.) We  ask if it is possible to place the rod in such a position that if it is released  at the instant when the train starts and allowed to move solely under the  influence of gravity and the motion of the train, it will not fall to the  floor during the entire journey from A to B.      A B   FIGURE 1   At first thought it might seem quite unlikely that for any given sched  ule of motion the interplay of gravity and reaction forces will always  permit such a maintenance of balance under the single condition that the  initial position of the rod is suitably chosen. But we state that such a  position always exists.   2412     The Lever of Mahomet 2413   Fortunately, the proof does not depend on a detailed knowledge of the  laws of dynamics. (If it did, our task would be exceedingly difficult.)  Only the following simple assumption of a physical nature need be  granted: The subsequent motion of the rod depends continuously on its  initial position; in particular, if for a given initial position the rod will  fall down and hit the floor in one direction, then for any initial position  differing sufficiently little from this, the rod will not hit the floor in the  opposite direction.   Now the position of the rod in the train at any time is characterized  by the angle a which it makes with the floor. To the angles a = and  a= 180 respectively correspond the two flat positions of the rod. We  denote by x the angle of the initial position of the rod. The proof of our  statement will be given indirectly, in line with its purely existential char  acter. We shall assume that whatever initial position x we choose, the rod  will always fall down and touch the floor, either at a = or at a = 180.  We may then define a function /(*) whose value is to be +1 if the rod  hits the floor at = 0, and 1 otherwise. Since we have assumed that  for each initial angle x we have one of the two cases, the function /(*)  is defined in the whole interval ^ x ^ 180. Obviously /(O) = +1 and  /(1 80) = 1, while according to the assumed continuity property of our  dynamical system, /(*) will be a continuous function of x in the closed  interval Q^x^ 180. Hence, by Bolzano's theorem, it must have the  value /(*) = for some intermediate value of the initial angle x, contra  dicting the definition of /(*) as only able to assume the values +1 or 1.  This absurdity proves false the assumption that the rod will fall to the  floor during the journey for every initial position x.   It is clear that this statement has an entirely theoretical character,  since the proof gives no indication of how to find the desired initial  position. Moreover, even if such a position could be calculated theoreti  cally, it would probably be quite useless in practice, because of its in  stability. For example, in the extreme case where the train remains  motionless at station A during the entire journey, the solution is obviously  x = 90, but anyone who has attempted to balance a needle upright on a  plate for any length of time will find this result of little assistance. Never  theless, for the mathematician, the existence proof that we have given  loses none of its interest.     COMMENTARY ON   Games and Puzzles     GAMES and puzzles are the subject of a considerable mathematical  literature, much of which is both difficult and tedious. The writings  on magic squares alone suffice to make a fair-sized library. Nothing more  dismal can be imagined. It is not inevitable that the mathematical treat  ment of games should work a blight. Games are, among the most interest  ing creations of the human mind, and the analysis of their structure is  full of adventure and surprises. Unfortunately there is never a lack of  mathematicians for the job of transforming delectable ingredients into a  dish that tastes like a damp blanket.   A few books on the subject will delight almost any reader. This group  includes W. W. Rouse Ball's classic, Mathematical Recreations and Essays,  W. Ahrens' Mathematische Unterhaltungen und Spiele, H. E. Dudeney's  Amusements in Mathematics, E. Lucas' Recreations Mathematiques, and  the immortal Sam Loyd's helter-skelter Cyclopaedia of Puzzles. A recent  addition to these is A History oj Board Games Other than Chess by  H. J. R. Murray. 1 Mr. Murray, known for his monumental History of  Chess, presents some 270 games, ancient and modern, of the widest  provenance and diffusion. Despite their diversity, he is able to classify  the games into five basic groups; games of "alignment and configuration"  (e.g., tic-tac-toe), "war games" (e.g., chess and checkers), "hunt games"  (e.g., fox and geese), "race games" (e.g., parcheesi), and "mancala  games" (e.g., "dealing of beans into a series of holes and pockets" a  diversion all but unknown in Europe but described as "the national game  of Africa"). It is surprising to find that nothing really new has been born  in the world of games during the last ten centuries. The latest gambling  device or puzzle sold by Abercrombie and Fitch is apt to have an Egyp  tian ancestor of the twelfth dynasty, or to have been played for genera  tions in Basutoland or by Bulgarian peasants. Even where the form of a  game is new, its fundamental scheme can usually be fitted into an  established classification.   Kasner and I made a similar attempt at reduction in a field broader  than Murray's. Our enumeration does not compare with his in exhaustive-  ness; but many of the principal prototypes of games and puzzles are set  forth. It used to be thought that the mark of a good game was its useless-  ness; that is now known to be a mistake. In recent years mathematicians  have dissected these playthings and shown that their strategy is applicable  to such worth-while activities as business and war. One of the leaders in     1 Oxford University Press, 1952.   2414     Games and Puzzles 2415   this new branch of research is the contemporary mathematician, John von  Neumann. The theory of games has now been brought to such a high stage  of development that in the next war a mastery of the subtler elements of  draughts and rithmomachy, or even of dominoes, may prove decisive. Our  treatment of games is in the older tradition. The analysis will not, we  trust, help you to win a battle or corner the market in black pepper.   The second selection, from Ball and W. E. H. Berwick, considers a  special class of arithmetical recreations, some of whose problems are  simple, some exceptionally taxing. The problems are known as arithmet  ical restorations: it is required, given an imperfect set of digits, of an  exercise in addition, division, multiplication, to reconstruct the complete  figures. There are no general rules, or mathematical formulas which help  to solve these problems. It is a matter of pure ingenuity, reasoning power  and perseverance.     Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do. and  whatever a body is not obliged to do.     5 Pastimes of Past and  Present Times   By EDWARD KASNER  and JAMES R. NEWMAN   IT HAS been said, "It is not by amusing oneself that one learns," * and  in reply: "It is only by amusing oneself that one can learn." Wherever the  truth may lie, somewhere between those extremes, it is undeniable that  mathematical recreations furnish a challenge to imagination and a power  ful stimulus to mathematical activity. The theory of equations, of prob  ability, the infinitesimal calculus, the theory of point sets, of topology-  all are' fruits grown from seeds sown in the fertile soil of creative imagina  tionall have grown out of problems first expressed in puzzle form.   Puzzles and paradoxes have been popular since antiquity, and in amus  ing themselves with these playthings men sharpened their wits and  whetted their ingenuity. But it was not for amusement alone that Kepler,  Pascal, Fermat, Leibniz, Euler, Lagrange, Hamilton, Cayley, and many  others devoted so much time to puzzles. Researches in recreational mathe  matics sprang from the same desire to know, were guided by the same  principles, and required the exercise of the same faculties as the researches  leading to the most profound discoveries in mathematics and mathemati  cal physics. Accordingly, no branch of intellectual activity is a more ap  propriate subject for discussion than puzzles and paradoxes.     The field is enormous. Puzzles have been in the making since Egyptian  times and probably before. From the cryptical utterances of the oracle of  Delphi, through the time of Charlemagne, down to the golden age of  the crossword, paradoxes and puzzles, like the creatures of the earth, have  assumed every shape and form and have multiplied. We can examine only  a few of the dominating species, those which have survived in one shape  or another and continue to thrive in streamlined form.   Most of the famous puzzles invented before the 17th century may be  found in the first great puzzle book, Les problemes plaisants et delectables,  qui se font par les nombres, by Claude-Gaspard Bachet, Sieur de Meziriac.  Although it appeared in 1612, two years before Napier's work on loga-   1 Anatole France, The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard*   2416     Pastimes of Past and Present Times 2417   rithms, it is still a delightful book and a quarry of information. Many  collections have appeared since then, 2 Bachef s volume alone having been  enlarged to almost five times its original size.   All we can hope to do is to follow the illustrious example of Mark  Twain in a similar predicament. He attempted to reduce all jokes to a  dozen primitive or elementary forms (mother-in-law, farmer's daughter,  etc.). We shall attempt to present a few of the typical puzzles that illus  trate the basic ideas from which all are evolved. . . .     Puzzles often seem difficult because they are not easy to interpret in  precise terms. In attempting the solution of a problem, the method of  trial and error is not only more natural, but generally easier than the  mathematical attack. It is common experience that often the most for  midable algebraic equations are easier to solve than problems formulated  in words. Such problems must first be translated into symbols, and the  symbols placed into the proper equations "before the problems can be  solved.   When Flaubert was a very young man, he wrote a letter to his sister,  Carolyn, in which he said: "Since you are now studying geometry and  trigonometry, I will give you a problem. A ship sails the ocean. It left  Boston with a cargo of wool. It grosses 200 tons. It is bound for Le Havre.  The mainmast is broken, the cabin boy is on deck, there are 12 passen  gers aboard, the wind is blowing East-North-East, the clock points to a  quarter past three in the afternoon. It is the month of May How old is  the captain?" Flaubert was not only teasing, he was uttering a complaint  shared by that large and respectable company "not good at puzzles," that  the average puzzle both confuses and overwhelms with superfluous words. 8   2 W.

THE ARTISANS   There are three men, John, Jack and Joe, each of whom is engaged in two occu  pations. Their occupations classify each of them as two of the following: chauffeur,  bootlegger, musician, painter, gardener, and barber.   From the following facts find in what two occupations each man is engaged:   1. The chauffeur offended the musician by laughing at his long hair.   2. Both the musician and the gardener used to go fishing with John.   3. The painter bought a quart of gin from the bootlegger.   4. The chauffeur courted the painter's sister.   5. Jack owed the gardener $5.   6. Joe beat both Jack and the painter at quoits.     24 jg Edward Kasner and James R. Newman   For that reason, the following puzzles have been stripped of all inessential  elements so as to exhibit their underlying mathematical structure. And we  understand by the term "mathematical structure" not necessarily some  thing expressed by numbers, angles, or lines, but the essential internal re  lationship between the component elements of the puzzle. For, at bottom,  that is all that mathematical analysis can reveal, all that mathematics itself  signifies.     Among the oldest problems are those which involve ferrying people and  their belongings across a river under somewhat trying conditions. Alcuin,  the friend of Charlemagne, suggested a problem which has since been  Vestated and complicated in many ways. A traveler comes to a riverbank  with his possessions: a wolf, a goat, and a head of cabbage. The only  available boat is very small and can cany no more than the traveler and  one of his possessions. Unfortunately, if left together, the goat will eat the  cabbage and the wolf dine on the goat. How shall the traveler transport  his belongings to the other side of the river, keeping his vegetables and  animals intact? 4 The solution may be attempted with the aid of a match  box, representing the boat, and four slips of paper for its occupants.   A more elaborate version of this problem was suggested in the sixteenth  century by Tartaglia. Three beautiful brides with their jealous husbands  also come to a river. The small boat which is to take them across holds  only two people. To avoid any compromising situations, the crossings are  to be so arranged that no woman shall be left with a man unless her hus  band is present. Eleven passages are required. Five passages would be  required for two couples, but with four or more couples the crossing  under the conditions stated would be impossible.   Similar problems involve shunting. In Figure 1 there is a locomotive,  L, and 2 freight cars, W l and W 2 ~ The common portion of the rails of the  two sidings on which flf^ and W 2 are standing, DA, is long enough to hold  R 7 ! or W 2 , but not both, nor the locomotive L. Thus, a car on DA can  be shunted to either siding. The engineer's job is to switch the positions  of Wi and W%. How can this be done? Although this problem presents   4 There are two different ways, both of which are symbolized in the following table.   FIRST SOLUTION SECOND SOLUTION   W = WOLF C CABBAGE  G = GOAT - = CROSSING   1.

Simeon Poisson's family tried to make Mm everything from a surgeon  to a lawyer, the last on the theory that he was fit for nothing better. One  or two of these professions he tackled with singular ineptitude, but at last  he found his metier. It was on a journey that someone posed him a prob  lem similar to the one below. Solving it immediately, he realized his tree  calling and thereafter devoted himself to mathematics, becoming one of  the greatest mathematicians of the nineteenth century. 5   Two friends who have an eight-quart jug of wine wish to share it  evenly. They also have two empty jars, one holding five quarts, the other  three. The diagram illustrates how they were able to divide their wine into  two portions of four quarts each. 6   5 At least so says his biographer, Arago. Not only was the quality of Poisson's work  extremely high, but the output was enormous. Besides occupying several important  official positions, lie turned out over 300 works in a comparatively short lifetime  (1781-1840). "La vie, c'est le travail," said this erstwhile shadow on the Poisson  household, though oddly enough, a puzzle brought htm to a life dedicated to unceas  ing labor.   6 Ffll the 5 quart jar from the 8 quart jar and pour 3 quarts from the 5 quart jar  into the 3 quart jar. Then pour the 3 quarts back into the 8 quart jar. Pour the re  maining 2 quarts from the 5 quart jar into the 3 quart jar. Now fill the 5 quart jar  again. Since there are 2 quarts in the 3 quart jar, one additional quart wffl fill this  jar. Pour enough wine from the 5 quart jar to fiU the 3 quart jar. The 5 quart jar  will then have 4 quarts remaining in it. Now pour the 3 quarts from the 3 quart  jar into the 8 quart jar. This, together with the 1 quart remaining in the 8 quart jar,  will make 4 quarts.     2420     Edward Kasner and James R. Newman       FIGURE 2p-Solution to t&e problem of the 3 jars.  *****   The mystifying nature of so many arithmetic tricks lies, as we have  indicated, in their structure, not their content. With a strainer to sift out  the essential ideas hidden between dozens of useless ones, every man could  be his own magician. A silly little riddle, oft repeated among mathemati  cians, comes to mind. "How shall one catch the lions in the desert?" it  is asked. Since there is so much sand and so few lions, simply take a  strainer, strain out the sand, and there are the lions! Such a strainer, then,  or perhaps a scalpel, is needed to get at the rudiments. When the verbiage  has been swept away the puzzle skeletons succumb to simple arithmetic  or algebra. The parlor tricks of guessing numbers which others have  selected, or cards which someone has chosen seem almost as wonderful as  instances of "extra sensory perception." But after we have learned to  separate the lions from the sand, caging them is comparatively simple.     Pastimes of Past and Present Times 2421   Card tricks are usually arithmetic puzzles in disguise. Generally, they  are amenable to mathematical analysis, and are not, as is commonly be  lieved, performed by sleight of hand. One important principle, easily over  looked, is that "cutting a pack of cards never alters the relative positions  of the cards, provided that, if necessary, we regard the top card as follow  ing immediately after the bottom card in the pack." 7 Once this is under  stood, many tricks cease to be baffling.   Seven poker players have invested in a new deck of cards. In keeping  with tradition the cards are cut, not shuffled, on the first deal. The dealer,  pretending to cheat, takes his second and fourth cards from the bottom  of the deck. This lapse is noticed by everyone, as intended. However,  when the other players pick up their cards, they are reluctant to demand  a new deal, each one finding that he has a full house. But still fearful  that the dealer has fixed up a better hand for himself, they insist that he  discard his 5 cards and take the next 5 from the top of the deck. Feigning  indignation he acquiesces and wins with a straight flush. Try it. Ninety-  nine times out of one hundred you will succeed in cheating your friends  but then, you can't cheat an honest man.   Frequently, the arithmetic tricks of guessing a number selected by an  other depend on the scale of notation. When a number is expressed in the  decimal system, such a 3976, what is actually meant is   (3 X 10 3 ) + (9 X 10 2 ) + (7 X 10 1 ) + (6 X 10).  The table 8 further illustrates other numbers written to the base 10.   EXAMPLE 10 10 1 10 2 10 3 10*   469 = 9 X 10 + 6 X 10 1 -f 4 X 10 2  = 9 +60 +400   7901 = 1 X 10 -f X 10 1 + 9 X 10 2 + 7 X 10 3  = 1 +0 +900 + 7000   30,000 = X 10 + X 10 1 + X 10 2 + X 10 s + 3 X 1Q 4  = +0 +0 +0 + 30,000   21,148 = 8 X 10 + 4 X 10 1 + 1 X 10 2 + 1 X 10 3 + 2 X 10*  = 8 +40 +100 + 1000 + 20,000   Among the wide variety of problems which arise from the use of the  decimal system, the following are of some interest:   A useful device for checking multiplication goes by the copybook title  of "casting out nines."   Consider 1234 X 5678 = 7006652. Add the digits of the multiplier,  multiplicand, and product, thus obtaining. 10, 26 and 26 respectively. Since   7 W. W. R. Ball, op. cit.   8 Other bases have been suggested. There is reason to believe that the Babylonians  employed the base 60, and in more recent times, the use of the base 12 has been  urged rather strongly.     Edward Kasner and James R. Newman  2422   each of these numbers is greater than 9, add the digits of the individual  sums once more,* obtaining 1, 8, and 8. (If, after the first repetition a  sum greater than 9 remains, the digits may be added once again.) Now,  take the product of the integers corresponding to the multiplier, and the  multiplicand, i.e., 1 X 8, and compare this with the integer corresponding  to the sum of the digits of the product, which is also 8. Since they are  the same, the result of the original multiplication is correct.   Using the same rule, let us test whether the product of 31256 and 8427  is 263395312. Again the sum of the digits of the multiplicand, multiplier,  and the product are respectively 17, 21 and 34; repeating, the sum of  these digits is 8, 3, and 7. The product of the first two equals 24 which  has 6 for the sum of its digits. But the sum of the digits of the product  equals 7. Thus, we have two different remainders, 6 and 7, whence the  multiplication must be incorrect.   Closely connected with the rule of casting out nines is the following  trick, which reveals a remarkable property common to all numbers.   Take any number and rearrange its digits in any order you please to  form another number. The difference between the first number and the  second is always divisible by 9. 10   Another type of problem dependent on the decimal scale of notation  involves finding numbers which may be obtained by multiplying their re-  versals by integers. Among such numbers with 4 digits, 8712 equals 4  times 2178, and 9801 equals 9 times 1089.   The binary or dyadic notation (using the base 2) is hardly a new con  cept, having been referred to in a Chinese book believed to have been  written about 3000 B.C. Forty-six centuries later, Leibniz rediscovered the  wonders of the binary scale and marveled at it as though it were a new  invention somewhat like the twentieth-century city dweller, who, upon  seeing a sundial for the first time, and having it explained, remarked with  awe: "What will they think of next?" In its use of only two symbols,  Leibniz saw in the dyadic system something of great religious and mystic  significance: God could be represented by unity, and nothingness by zero,  and since God had created all forms out of nothingness, zero and one  combined could be made to express the entire universe. Anxious to impart  this gem of wisdom to the heathens, Leibniz communicated it to the Jesuit  Grimaldi, president of the Tribunal of Mathematics in China, in the hope  that he could thus show the Emperor of China the error of his ways in  clinging to Buddhism instead of adopting a God who could create a uni  verse out of nothing.   Whereas the decimal scale requires ten symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , 9,   9 Thus 10=l-fO = l   26 = 2 + 6 = 8, etc.   10 Hall and Knight, Higher Algebra.     Pastimes of Past and Present Times 2423   the binary scale uses only two: and 1. Below are the first 32 integers  given in the binary scale.   DECIMAL BINARY DECIMAL BINARY   1=1 17 10001   2 = 10 18 10010   3 = 11 19 = 10011   4 =2 2 =100 20 = 10100   5 = 101 21 = 10101   6 = 110 22 10110   7 = 111 23 = 10111   8 =2 3 =1000 24 = 11000   9 = 1001 25 = 11001   10 = 1010 26 = 11010   11 = 1011 27 = 11011   12 = 1100 28 = 11100   13 = 1101 29 = 11101   14 = 1110 30 = 11110   15 = 1111 31 = 11111   16 =2 4 = 10000 32 =2 5 = 100000   Since 2 = 1, it may readily be seen that any number can be expressed as  the sum of powers of 2, just as any number in the decimal system can be  expressed as the sum of powers of 10, For example, the number expressed  in the decimal system as 25, is expressed in the binary system, using only  the two symbols 1 and 0, by 11001.   DECIMAL DYADIC   25 = 11001   I I   (2 X 10 1 ) + (5 X 10). (1 X 2 4 ) -f (1 X 2) -f (0 X 2 2 )   -f (OX2 1 ) + (1 X2).   Because numbers can be more briefly written in the decimal scale than  in the binary, it is more convenient, although in every other respect the  latter is just as accurate and efficient. Even fractions have their place in  the dyadic notation. The fraction %, for example, given by the nontermi-  nating decimal, .33333 ..., is represented in the binary notation by a  non terminating binary, .01010101 . . . n   The binary system easily makes understandable the solution of prob  lems such as:   I. In many sections of Russia, the peasants employed until recently what  appears to be a very strange method of multiplication. In substance, this  was at one time in use in Germany, France, and England, and is similar  to a method used by the Egyptians 2000 years before the Christian era.   It is best illustrated by an example: To multiply 45 by 64, form two   11 Arnold Dresden, An Invitation to Mathematics, New York: Henry Holt & Co.,  1936.     2424     Edward Kasner and James R. Newman     columns. At the head of one put 45, at the head of the other, 64. Suc  cessively multiply one column by 2 and divide the other by the same  number. When an odd number is divided by 2, discard the remaining  fraction. The result will be:     (A)     DIVIDE  45   22  11   5   2   1     MULTIPLY  64   128   256   512  1024  2048     Take from the second column those numbers which appear opposite an  odd number in the first. Add them and you obtain the desired product:     (B)     45  22  11,   5*   2   1     64   128   256   512   1024   2048     . 64 = 2 X 64  = 2 1 X 64   . 256 = 2 2 X 64   . 512 = 2 3 X 64  = 2 4 X 64   2048 = 2 5 X 64     2880 = 45 X 64     The relation of this method to the dyadic system may be seen upon  expressing 45 in the dyadic notation.   45 = (1 X 2 5 ) + (0 X 2 4 ) + (1 X 2 3 ) + (1 X 2 2 ) + (0 X 2 1 )   + (1 X2<>)  = 101101     Therefore,   45 X 64 = (25 + 23 + 2 2 + 2) X 64   = (25 X 64) + (2 3 X 64) + (2 2 X 64) + (2 X 64).   Since 2 4 and 2 1 do not appear in the dyadic expression for 45, the prod  ucts (2 4 x 64) and (2 1 X 64) are not included in the numbers to be  added in (B). Thus, what the peasant does in multiplying 45 by 64 is to  multiply 2 5 , 2 3 , 2 2 , 2, successively by 64, and then take the sum.  II. Another well-known problem, already mentioned by Cardan, consists      FIGURE 3 The Chinese ring puzzle.     Pastimes of Past and Present Times 2425   in the removal of a number of rings from a bar. The puzzle can best be  analyzed by the use of the dyadic system, although the actual manipula  tion of the rings is at all times extremely difficult.  The rings on the bar are so connected that although the end one can be  removed without difficulty, any other ring can be put on or removed only  when the one next to it, toward the end (A in the figure) is on the bar,  and all the rest of the rings are off. Thus, to remove the fifth ring, the  first, second, third must be off the bar, and the fourth must be on. If the  position of all the rings on or off the rack are written in the dyadic  notation, 1 designating a ring which is off, and designating a ring which  is on, the mathematical determination of the number of moves required  to remove a given number of rings is not too hard. The solution without  the aid of the dyadic notation, as the rings increase in number, would  be wholly beyond one's imaginative powers.   III. The problem of the Tower of Hanoi is similar in principle. The game  consists of a board with three pegs, as illustrated in Figure 4.   On one of these pegs rest a number of discs of various sizes, so arranged  that the largest disc is on the bottom, the next largest rests on that one,  the next largest on that, and so on, up to the smallest disc which is on  top. The problem is to transfer the entire set of discs to one of the other  two pegs, moving only one disc at a time, and making certain that no  disc is ever permitted to rest on one smaller than itself. If the removal  of a disc from one peg to another constitutes one transfer, the following  table shows the number of transfers required for various numbers up  to n discs:   TABLE FOR TRANSFERS 12   DISCS TRANSFERS   1 1   2 3   3 7   4 15   5 31   6 63   7 127     n 2*~1   There is a charming story about this toy: 13   In the great temple at Benares beneath the dome which marks the  center of the world, rests a brass plate hi which are fixed three diamond  needles, each a cubit high and as thick as the body of a bee. On one of  these needles, at the creation, God placed sixty-four discs of pure gold,   12 W. Ahrens, op. cit.   13 W. W. R. Ball, op. cit.     2426     Edward Kasner and James R. Newman      FIGURE 4   the largest disc resting on the brass plate and the others getting smaller  and smaller up to the top one. This is the Tower of Brahma. Day and  night unceasingly, the priests transfer the discs from one diamond needle  to another, according to the fixed and immutable laws of Brahma, which  require that the priest on duty must not move more than one disc at a  time and that he must place this disc on a needle so that there is no  smaller disc below it. When the sixty-four discs shall have been thus  transferred from the needle on which, at the creation, God placed them,  to one of the other needles, tower, temple, and Brahmans alike will crum  ble into dust, and with a thunderclap, the world will vanish.   The number of transfers required to fulfill the prophecy is 2 64 1,  that is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. If the priests were to effect one  transfer every second, and work 24 hours a day for each of the 365 days  in a year, 14 it would take them 58,454,204,609 centuries plus slightly  more than 6 years to perform the feat, assuming they never made a  mistake for one small slip would undo all their work.  IV. One other game may be mentioned in connection with the dyadic  system Nim. In this game, two players play alternately with a number  of counters placed in several heaps. At his turn, a player picks up one of  the heaps, or as many of the counters from it as he pleases. The player  taking the last counter loses. If the number of counters in each heap is  expressed in the binary scale, the game readily lends itself to mathematical  analysis. A player who can bring about a certain arrangement of the  number of counters in each heap may force a win. 15   It is interesting to note that the number 2 64 18,446,744,073,709,551,-  616 represented in the dyadic system by a number with 64 digits,  appears in the solution of a puzzle connected with the origin of the game  of chess.   According to an old tale, the Grand Vizier Sissa Ben Dahir was granted  a boon for having invented chess for the Indian King, Shirham. Since   14 (Making allowance for leap years. ED.)   15 See W. Ahrens, op. cit., and Bouton, Annals of Mathematics, series 2, vol. Ill  (1901-1902), pp. 35-39, for the mathematical proof of Nim.     Pastimes of Past and Present Times 2427       lid i!  if!!! i     FIGURE 5 The diagram illustrates how to force a win at the game of Nim. Assume each player  at his turn must pick up at least one match and may pick up as many as five. The  rule is that the player picking up the last match loses. Then, for example, imagine  that the original heap consists of 21 matches. In that case, the one playing first can  force a win by mentally dividing the matches into groups of 1, 6, 6, 6, and 2 (as in  B). Since he plays first, he picks up 2 matches. Then, however many his opponent  picks, the first player picks up the complement of 6, This is shown in A: If the aco-  ond player takes I, the first player takes 5; if the second player takes 2, the flm  player takes 4, and so on. Each of the three groups of 6 is thus exhausted, and the  second player is left with the last match.   Had there been 47 matches, say, the grouping to force a win for the first pfctffcr  would have been: 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, and 4. Rules for any other variation of Nim  can also be easily formulated.   this game is played on a board with 64 squares, Sissa addressed the king:  "Majesty, give me a grain of wheat to place on the first square, and two  grains of wheat to place on the second square, and four grains of wheat to  place on the third, and eight grains of wheat to place on the fourth, and  so, Oh,- King, let me cover each of the 64 squares of the board." "And  is that all you wish, Sissa, you fool?' exclaimed the astonished King.  "Oh, Sire," Sissa replied, "I have asked for more wheat than you have in  your entire kingdom, nay, for more wheat than there is in the whole  world, verily, for enough to cover the whole surface of the earth to the  depth of the twentieth part of a cubit." ie Now the number of grains of  16 One-twentieth of a cubit is about one inch.     2428 Edward Kasner and James R. Newman   wheat which Sissa demanded is 2 64 - 1, exactly the same as the number  of disc transfers required to fulfill the prophecy of Benares related on  pp. 2425-2426.   Another remarkable way in which 2 84 arises is in computing the num  ber of each person's ancestors from the beginning of the Christian era  just about 64 generations ago. In that length of time, assuming that each  person has 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great-grandparents, etc., and not  allowing for incestuous combinations, everyone has at least 2 64 ancestors,  or a little less than eighteen and a half quintillion lineal relations alone.  A most depressing thought.   *****   The Josephus problem is one of the most famous and certainly one  of the most ancient. It generally relates a story about a number of people  on board a ship, some of whom must be sacrificed to prevent the ship  from sinking. Depending on the time that the version of the puzzle was  written, the passengers were Christians and Jews, Christians and Turks,  sluggards and scholars, Negroes and whites, etc. Some ingenious soul  with a knowledge of mathematics always managed to preserve the favored  group. He arranged everyone in a circle, and reckoning from a certain  point onward, every nth person was to be thrown overboard n being a  specified integer. The arrangement of the circle by the mathematician  was such that either the Christians, or the industrious scholars, or the  whites were saved, while the rest were thrown overboard in accordance  with the Golden Rule.   Originally, this tale was told of Josephus who found himself in a cave  with 40 other Jews bent on self-extinction to escape a worse fate at the  hands of the Romans. Josephus decided to save his own neck. He placed  everyone in a circle and made them agree that each third person, count  ing around and around, should be killed. Placing himself and another  provident soul in the 16th and the 31st position of the circle of 41, he  and his companion, being the last ones left, were conveniently able to  avoid the road to martyrdom.   A later version of this problem places 15 Turks and 15 Christians on  board a storm-ridden ship which is certain to sink unless half the passen  gers are thrown overboard. After arranging everyone in a circle, the  Christians, ad majorem Dei gloriam, proposed that every ninth person  be sacrificed.   Thus, every infidel was properly disposed of, and all true Christians  saved. 17   Among the Japanese, the Josephus problem assumed another form:  Thirty children, 15 of the first marriage, and 15 of the second, agree that   17 The general rule of solution of all such problems may be found in P. G. Tait,  Collected Scientific Papers, 1900.     Pastimes of Past and Present Times 2429   their father's estate is too small to be divided among all of them. So the  second wife proposes that all the children be arranged in a circle, in  order to determine her husband's heir by a process of elimination. Being      FIGURE 6   C = Christian T = Turk   a prudent mathematician, as well as the proverbially wicked stepmother,  she arranges the children in such a way that one of her own is certain to  be chosen. After 14 of the children of the first marriage have been elimi  nated, the remaining child, evidently a keener mathematician than his  stepmother, proposes that the counting shall start afresh in the opposite  direction. Certain of her advantage, and therefore disposed to be generous,  she consents, but finds to her dismay that all 15 of her own children are  eliminated, leaving the one child of the first marriage to become the  heir. 18   Elaborate mathematical solutions of more difficult and generalized  versions of the Josephus problem were given by Euler, Schubert, and Tait.   No discussion of puzzles, however brief, can afford to omit mention  of the best-known of the many puzzles invented by Sam Loyd. "15  Puzzle," "Boss Puzzle," "Jeu de Taquin," are a few of its names. For  several years after its appearance in 1878, this puzzle enjoyed a popular  ity, particularly throughout Europe, greater than swing and contract   18 Smith & Mikami, A History of Japanese Mathematics, p. 83.     2430     Edward Kasner and James R. Newman      FIGURE 7 The Josephus problem, from Miyake Kenryu's "Shojutsu." (From Smith and Mikarai,  "A History of Japanese Mathematics.")   bridge combined enjoy today. In Germany, it was played in the streets,  in factories, in the royal palaces, and in the Reichstag. Employers were  forced to post notices forbidding their employees to play the "15 Puzzle"  during business hours under penalty of dismissal. The electorate, having  no such privileges, had to watch their duly elected representatives play  the "Boss Puzzle" in the Reichstag while Bismarck played the Boss. In  France, the "Jeu de Taquin" was played on the boulevards of Paris and  in every tiny hamlet from the Pyrenees to Normandy. A scourge of man  kind was the "Jeu de Taquin," according to a contemporary French  journalist, worse than tobacco and alcohol "responsible for untold  headaches, neuralgias, and neuroses."   For a time, Europe was "15 Puzzle" mad. Tournaments were staged  and huge prizes offered for the solution of apparently simple problems.  But the strange thing was that no one ever won any of these prizes, and  the apparently simple problems remained unsolved.   The "15 Puzzle" (figure below) consists of a square shallow box of  wood or metal which holds 15 little square blocks numbered from 1 to  15. There is actually room for 16 blocks in the box so that the 15 blocks  can be moved about and their places interchanged. The number of con  ceivable positions is 16! = 20,922,789,888,000. A problem consists of     Pastimes of Past and Present Times 2431   bringing about a specified arrangement of the blocks from a given initial  position, which is frequently the normal position illustrated in Figure 8.  Shortly after the puzzle was invented, two American mathematicians 19  proved that from any given initial order only half of all the conceivable     1    2    3    4    : ; : : :  : : ; :    5    6    7    8    : :J;    9    10    11    12    $    13    14    15    ^^i 1           FIGURE 8 The 15 Puzzle (also Boss Puzzle or Jeu de Taquin) in normal position.   positions can actually be obtained. Thus, there are always approximately  ten trillion positions which the possessor of a "15 Puzzle" can bring about,  and ten trillion that he cannot.   The fact that there are impossible positions makes it easy to understand  why such generous cash prizes were offered by Loyd and others, since  the problems for which prizes were offered always entailed impossible  positions. And it is heart-breaking to think of the headaches, neuralgias,  and neuroses that might have been spared to say nothing of the benefits  to the Reichstag if The American Journal of Mathematics had been as  widely circulated as the puzzle itself. With ten trillion possible solutions  there still would have been enough fun left for everyone.   In the normal position (Figure 8), the blank space is in the lower right-  hand corner. When making a mathematical analysis of the puzzle, it is  convenient to consider that a rearrangement of the blocks consists of  nothing more than moving the blank space itself through a specific path,  always making certain that it ends its journey in the lower right-hand  corner of the box. To this end, the blank space must travel through the  same number of boxes to the left as to the right and through the same  number of boxes upwards as downwards. In other words, the blank space  must move through an even number of boxes. If, starting from the normal  position, the desired one can be attained while complying with this  requirement, it is a possible position, otherwise it is impossible.   Based upon this principle, the method of determining whether a posi  tion is possible or impossible is very simple. In the normal position every  numbered block appears in its proper numerical order, i.e., regarding the  boxes, row by row, from left to right, no number precedes any number   19 Johnson & Story, American Journal of Mathematics, vol. 2 (1879).     2432     Edward Kasner and James R. Newman     smaller than itself. To bring about a position different from the normal  one, the numerical order of the blocks must be changed. Some numbers,  perhaps all, will precede others smaller than themselves. Every instance  of a number preceding another smaller than itself is called an inversion.  For example, if the number 6 precedes the numbers 2, 4, and 5, this is  an inversion to which we assign the value 3, because 6 precedes three  numbers smaller than itself. If the sum of the values of all the inversions  in a given position is even, the position is a possible one that is, it can  be brought about from the normal position. If the sum of the values of  the inversions is odd, the position is impossible and cannot be brought  about from the normal configuration.   The position illustrated in Figure 9 can be created from the normal  position since the sum of the values of the inversions is six an even  number.     2    1    4    3 j    6    5    8    7    10    9    12    11    13    14    15       FIGURE 9     But the position shown in Figure 10 is impossible, since, as may readily  be seen, the sum of the value of the inversions brought about is odd:     4    3    2    1 ;    8    7    6    5 ;    12    11    10    9    15    14    13       FIGURE 10   Figures 11 a, b, c illustrate three other positions.

If this statement is supposed to apply to the earth on which  we live, it is both useless and untrue. As we have seen in the previous  chapter, the nineteenth-century mathematicians Riemann and Lobachevsky  knew that the statement, if true at all, applied only to special surfaces. It  does not apply to a spherical surface on which the shortest distance be  tween two points is the arc of a great circle. Since the shape of the earth  approximates a sphere, the shortest distance between two points anywhere  on the surface of the earth is never a straight line, but is a portion of the  arc of a great circle,   Yet, for all practical purposes, even on the surface of the earth, the  shortest distance between two points is given by a straight line. That is to  say, in measuring ordinary distances with a steel tape or a yardstick, the  principle is substantially correct. However, for distances beyond even a  few hundred feet, allowance must be made for the curvature of the earth.  When a steel rod over 600 feet in length was recently constructed in a  large Detroit automobile factory, it was found that the exact measurement          A            B          c            D    \        T          t                ;              /      t  1  l  -*|   1          4              /   /    $.          y    &    /               \                        9         FIGURE 12 The spider, his kind invitation to the fly having been rebuffed, sets out for dinner  along the shortest possible route. What path is the geodesic for the hungry spider?     Edward Kasner and James R. Newman   of its length was impossible without allowing for the earth's curvature.  We indicated that the determination of a geodesic is very difficult for  complicated surfaces. But we can give one puzzle showing how deceptive  this problem may be for even the simplest case the flat surface.   In a room 30 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 12 feet high, there is a spider  in the center of one of the smaller walls, 1 foot from the ceiling; and  there is a fly hi the middle of the opposite wall, 1 foot from the floor.  The spider has designs on the fly. What is the shortest possible route along  which the spider may crawl to reach his prey? If he crawls straight down  the wall, then in a straight line along the floor, and then straight up the  other wall, or follows a similar route along the ceiling, the distance is 42  feet. Surely it is impossible to imagine a shorter route! However, by cut  ting a sheet of paper, which, when properly folded, will make a model of  the room (see Figure 12), and then by joining the points representing the  spider and the fly by a straight line, a geodesic is obtained. The length  of this geodesic is only 40 feet, in other words, 2 feet shorter than the  "obvious" route of following straight lines.   There are several ways of cutting the sheet of paper, and accordingly,  there are several possible routes, but that of 40 feet is the shortest; and  remarkably enough, as may be seen from cut D in Figure 12, this route  requires the spider to pass over 5 of the 6 sides of the room.   This problem graphically reveals the point emphasized throughout  our intuitive notions about space almost invariably lead us astray.     RELATIONSHIPS   Ernest Legouve, 20 the well known French dramatist, tells in his mem  oirs that, while taking the baths at Plombieres, he proposed a question  to his fellow bathers: "Is it possible for two men, wholly unrelated to  each other, to have the same sister?" "No, that's impossible," replied a  notary at once. An attorney who was not quite so quick in giving his  answer, decided after some deliberation, that the notary was right. There  upon, the others quickly agreed that it was impossible. "But still it is  possible," Legouve remarked, "and I will name two such men. One of  them is Eugene Sue, and I am the other." In the midst of cries of aston  ishment and demands that he explain, he called the bath attendant and  asked for the slate on which the attendant was accustomed to mark down  those who had come for their baths. On it, he wrote:   (~ means married to; | means offspring of)  Mrs. Sue~Mr. Sue Mrs. Sauvais^Mr. Sue Mrs. Sauvais~Mr. Legouve   Eugene Sue Flore Sue Ernest Legouve   20 Ahrens, op. cit., volume 2.     Pastimes of Past and Present Times 2435   "Thus, you see," he concluded, "it is quite possible for two men to have  the same sister, without being related to each other."   Most of the puzzles treated hitherto required four steps for their  solution:   1. Sifting out the essential facts.   2. Translating these facts into the appropriate symbols.   3. Setting up the symbols in equations.   4. Solving the equations.   To solve the problems of relationship two of these steps must be modified.  A simple diagram replaces the algebraic equation; inferences from the  diagram replace the algebraic solution. Without the symbols and diagrams,  however, the problems may become extremely confusing.   Alexander Macfarlane, a Scotch mathematician, developed an "algebra  of relationships" which was published in the proceedings of the Royal  Society of Edinburgh, but the problems to which he applied his calculus  were easily solvable without it. Macfarlane used the well-known jingle:   Brothers and sisters have I none,   But this man's father is my father's son,   as a guinea pig for his calculus, although the diagrammatic method gives  the solution much more quickly.   An old Indian fairy tale creates an intricate series of relationships which  would probably prove too much even for Macfarlane's algebra. A king,  dethroned by his relatives, was forced to flee with his wife and daughter.  During their flight they were attacked by robbers; while defending him  self, the king was killed, although his wife and daughter managed to  escape. Soon they came to a forest in which a prince of the neighboring  country and his son were hunting. The prince (a widower) and his son  (an eligible bachelor) noticing the footsteps of the mother and daughter  decided to follow them. The father declared that he would many the  woman with the large footsteps undoubtedly the older and the son  said he would marry the woman with the small footsteps who was surely  the younger. But on their return to the castle, the father and his son  discovered that the small feet belonged to the mother and the big feet to  the daughter. Nevertheless, mastering their disappointment, they married  as they had planned. After the marriage, the mother, daughter-in-law of  her daughter, the daughter, mother-in-law of her mother, both had chil  dren sons and daughters. The task of disentangling the resulting relation  ships we entrust to the reader, as well as the explanation of the following  verse found on an old gravestone at Alencourt, near Paris:   Here lies the son; here lies the mother;  Here lies the daughter; here lies the father;  Here lies the sister; here lies the brother;  Here lie the wife and the husband.  Still, there are only three people here.     2436 Edward Kasner and James R. Newman   In Albrecht Diirer's famous painting, "Melancholia," there appears a  device about which more has been written than any other form of mathe  matical amusement. The device is a magic square.   A magic square consists of an array of integers in a square which, when  added up by rows, diagonals, or columns, yield the same total. Magic  squares date back at least to the Arabs. Great mathematicians like Euler  and Cayley found them amusing and worth studying. Benjamin Franklin  admitted somewhat apologetically that he had spent some time in his youth  on these "trifles"- time "which," he hastened to add, "I might have em  ployed more usefully." Mathematicians have never pretended that magic  squares were anything more than amusement, however much time they  spent on them, although the continual study devoted to this puzzle form  may incidentally have cast some light on relations between numbers. Their  chief appeal is still mystical and recreational.   There are other puzzles of considerable interest not discussed here 21  because we treat them more fully in their proper place. 22 Among these  are problems connected with the theory of probability, map-coloring, and  the one-sided surfaces of Mobius,   Only one extensive group of problems remains those connected with  the theory of numbers. The modern theory of numbers, represented by a  vast literature, engages the attention of every serious mathematician. It is  a branch of study, many theorems of which, though exceedingly difficult   21 See, for example, Kasner and Newman's discussion of paradoxes, pp. 1936-1955.   22 There are also puzzles which though very amusing and deceptive, present no  mathematical idea which has not been already considered and such puzzles have,  therefore, been omitted. We may, nevertheless, give three examples, chosen because  they are so often solved incorrectly:   (a) A glass is half-filled with wine, and another glass half-rilled with water. From  the first glass remove a teaspoonful of wine and pour it into the water. From the  mixture take a teaspoonful and pour it into the wine. Is the quantity of wine in the  water glass now greater or less than the quantity of water in the wine glass? To end  all quarrels they are the same,   (b) The following puzzle troubled the delegates to a distinguished gathering of  puzzle experts not long ago. A monkey hangs on one end of a rope which passes  through a pulley and is balanced by a weight attached to the other end. The monkey  decides to climb the rope. What happens? The astute puzzlers engaged in all sorts  of futile conjectures and speculations, ranging from doubts as to whether the monkey  could climb the rope, to rigorous "mathematical demonstrations" that he couldn't.  (We yield to a shameful and probably superfluous urge to point out the solution  the weight rises, like the monkey!)   (c) Imagine we have a piece of string 25,000 miles long, just long enough to ex  actly encircle the globe at the equator. We take the string and fit it snugly around,  over oceans, deserts, and jungles. Unfortunately, when we have completed our task  we find that in manufacturing the string there has been a slight mistake, for it is  just a yard too long.   To overcome the error, we decide to tie the ends together and to distribute this  36 inches evenly over the entire 25,000 miles. Naturally (we imagine) this will never  be noticed. How far do you think that the string will stand off from the ground at  each point, merely by virtue of the fact that it is 36 inches too long?   The correct answer seems incredible, for the string will stand 6 inches from the  earth over the entire 25,000 miles.   To make this seem more sensible you might ask yourself: In walking around the  surface of the earth, how much further does your head travel than your feet?     Pastimes of Past and Present Times 2437   to prove, can be simply stated and readily understood by everyone. Such  theorems are therefore more widely known among educated laymen than  theorems of far greater importance in other branches of mathematics,  theorems which require technical knowledge- to be understood. Every book  on mathematical recreations is filled with simple or ingenious, cunning or  marvelous, easy or difficult puzzles based on the behavior and properties  of numbers. Space permits us to mention only one or two of those signifi  cant theorems about numbers which, in spite of their profundity, can be  easily grasped.   Ever since Euclid proved 2B that the number of primes is infinite, math  ematicians have been seeking for a test which would determine whether  or not a given number is a prime. But no test applicable to all numbers  has been found. Curiously enough, there is reason to believe that certain  mathematicians of the seventeenth 'century, who spent a great deal of  time on number theory, had means of recognizing primes unknown to us.  The French mathematician Mersenne and his much greater contemporary,  Fermat, had an uncanny way of determining the values of p, for which  2 p 1 is a prime. It has not yet been clearly determined how completely  they had developed their method, or indeed, exactly what method they  employed. Accordingly, it is still a source of wonder that Fermat replied  without a moment's hesitation to a letter which asked whether 100895598-  169 was a prime, that it was the product of 898423 and 112303, and that  each of these numbers was prime. 24 Without a general formula for all  primes, a mathematician, even today, might spend years hunting for the  correct answer.   One of the most interesting theorems of number theory is Goldbach's,  which states that every even number is the sum of two primes. It is easy  to understand; and there is every reason to believe that it is true, no even  number having ever been found which is not the sum of two primes; yet,  no one has succeeded in finding a proof valid for all even numbers.   But perhaps the most famous of all such propositions, believed to be  true, but never proved, is "Fermat's Last Theorem." In the margin of his  copy of Diophantus, Fermat wrote: "If n is a number greater than two,  there are no whole numbers, a, b, c such that a n + b n = c n . I have found  a truly wonderful proof which this margin is too small to contain." What  a pity! Assuming Fermat actually had a proof, and his mathematical  talents were of such a high order that it is certainly possible, he would  have saved succeeding generations of mathematicians unending hours of   23 Euclid's proof that there is an infinite number of primes is an elegant and con  cise demonstration. If P is any prime, a prime* greater than P can always be found.  Construct Pl + 1. This number, obviously greater than P, is not divisible by P or any  number less than P. There are only two alternatives: (1) It is not divisible at all;  (2) It is divisible by a prime lying between P and P! + 1. But both of these alterna  tives prove the existence of a prime greater than P. Q.E.D.   24 Ball, op. cit.     2438 Edward Kasner and James R. Newman   labor if he had found room for it on the margin, Almost every great  mathematician since Fermat attempted a proof, but none has ever  succeeded.   Many pairs of integers are known, the sum of whose squares is also a  square, thus:   3 2 + 4 2 = 5 2 ; or, 6 2 + 8 2 = 10 2 .   But no three integers have ever been found where the sum of the cubes  of two of them is equal to the cube of the third. It was Format's conten  tion that this would be true for all integers when the power to which they  were raised was greater than 2. By extended calculations, it has been  shown that Fermat's theorem is true for values of n up to 617. But  Fermat meant it for every n greater than 2. Of all his great contributions  to mathematics, Fermat's most celebrated legacy is a puzzle which three  centuries of mathematical investigation have not solved and which skeptics  believe Fermat, himself, never solved.     Somewhat reluctantly we must take our leave of puzzles. Reluctantly,  because we have been able to catch only a glimpse of a rich and enter  taining subject, and because puzzles in one sense, better than any other  single branch of mathematics, reflect its always youthful, unspoiled, and  inquiring spirit. When a man stops wondering and asking and playing, he  is through. Puzzles are made of the things that the mathematician, no less  than the child, plays with, and dreams and wonders about, for they are  made of the things and circumstances of the world he lives in.     / am ill at these numbers.

SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE   (The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, The Norwood Builder)     Arithmetical Restorations   By W. W. ROUSE BALL     I TAKE next a class of problems dealing with the reconstruction of arith  metical sums from which various digits have been erased. Some of these  questions are easy, some difficult. This kind of exercise has attracted a  good deal of attention in recent years. I give examples of three kinds of  restoration.   Class A. The solutions of one group of these restoration questions  depend on the well-known propositions that every number     a + 106 + 10 2 c-|-  is equal to any of certain expressions such as     M (9) +a + b + c   M (11) +a-b + c   M (33) + (a + 106) + (c + lOo*) + (e + 10/) 4- ...   M (101) H- (a + 10&) - (c + lOo 1 ) + (e + 10/) - ...   M (m) + (a + 106 + 10 2 c) + (d 4- lOe + 10 2 /) + . . .   M (n) + (a + 106 + 10 2 c) - (d + We + 10 2 /) + . . .   where, in the penultimate line, m = 27, or 37, or 111, and in the last line,  n = 7, or 13, or 77, or 91, or 143.   Examples, depending on such propositions, are not uncommon. Here  are four easy instances of this class of questions.   (i) The product of 417 and . 1 . . . is 9. . .057. Find the missing digits,  each of which is represented by a dot. If the undetermined digits in the  multiplier are denoted in order by a, b> c, d } and we take the steps of the  multiplication in their reverse order, we obtain successively d=l, c = 2,  b = 9. Also the product has 7 digits, therefore a 2. Hence the product  is 9,141,057.   (ii) The seven-digit number 70. .34. is exactly divisible by 792. Find  the missing digits, each of which is represented by a dot. Since 792 is  8 X 9 X 11, we can easily show that the number is 7,054,344.   (iii) The five-digit number 4.18. is divisible by 101. Find the missing  digits. 1   1 P. Delens, Probltmes & Arithmttique Amusante, Paris, 1914, p. 55.   2439     2440 W. W, Rouse Ball   Denote the two missing digits, from right to left, by x and 37. Applying  the theorem for 101, noting that each of the unknowns cannot exceed 9,  and for convenience putting y = 10 z, this equation gives z = 1, x = 7,  -y = 9. Hence the number is 49,187.   (iv) The four-digit number .8. . is divisible by 1287. Find the missing  digits. 2   Denote these digits, from right to left, by x, y, z. We have 1287 =  9 X 11 X 13. Applying the suitable propositions, and noting that each of  the unknowns cannot exceed 9, we get x = 1, y = 6, z = 3. Hence the  number is 3861.   (v) As a slightly harder example of this type, suppose we know that  6.80.8. .51 is exactly divisible by 73 and 137. Find the missing digits. 3  The data suffice to determine the number, which is 6,780,187,951.   Class B. Another and more difficult class of restoration problems is  illustrated by the following examples. Their solutions involve analytical  skill which cannot be reduced to rules.   (i) I begin with an easy instance, said to be of Hindoo origin, in which  the problem is to restore the missing digits in the annexed division sum  where a certain six-digit number when divided by a three-digit number  gives a three-digit result, 4     .50.  '.4!     The solution involves no difficulty. The answer is that the divisor is 215,  and the quotient 573; the solution is unique.   (ii) As a more difficult specimen I give the following problem, pro  posed in 1921 by Prof. Schuh of Delft. A certain seven-digit integer when  divided by a certain six-digit integer gives a result whose integral part is  a two-digit number and whose fractional part is a ten-digit expression of"  which the last nine digits form a repeating decimal, as indicated in the  following work, where a bar has been put above the repeating digits. It  is required to restore the working. 5 This problem is remarkable from the  fact that not a single digit is given explicitly.   2 Ibid., p. 57.   3 Ibid n p. 60.   4 American Mathematical Monthly, 1921, vol. XXVIII p 37  * Ibid., p. 278.     Arithmetical Restorations 2441     The answer is that the divisor is 667334 and the dividend is 7752341.   Here are three additional examples of arithmetical restorations. 6 The  solutions are lengthy and involve much empirical work.   (iii) The first of these Berwick questions is as follows. In the following  division sum all the digits, except the seven "7's" shown, have been erased:  each missing digit may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or (except in the first  digit of a line) 0. Observe that every step in the working consists of two  lines each of which contains an equal number of digits. The problem is  to restore the whole working of the sum. The solution is unique and  gives a divisor of 125473 and a quotient of 58781.   ....7.). .7 (..7..      6 All are due to W. E. H. Berwick. The "7" problem appeared in the School  World, July and October 1906, vol. VIII, pp. 280, 320; the "4" problem appeared in  the Mathematical Gazette, 1920, vol. X, pp. 43, 359-360; the "5" problem in the  same paper, voL.X, p. 361, vol. XI, p. 8.   7 This problem, fully worked out, appears on page 2444,     W. W.

To this problem there are four solutions, the divisors being 846, 848, 943,  949; and the respective quotients 1419, 1418, 1418, 1416,  If we propound the problem (using five "4's") thus:     ..4.  ...4     .4.     there is only one solution, and some will think this is a better form in  which to enunciate it.

(.5.   ..5..     To this problem there is only one solution, the divisor being 3926 and the  quotient 652.   Class C. A third class of digit problems depends on finding the values     Arithmetical Restorations M   2443   of certain symbols which represent specified numbers. Two examples will  suffice.   (i) Here is a very simple illustrative specimen. The result of multiply-  ing be by be is abc, where the letters stand for certain numbers. What  are the numbers? A brief examination shows that be stands for 25, and  therefore a stands for 6.   (ii) Here is another example. The object is to find the digits repre  sented by letters in the following sum: 8     ah) cdeeb (bfb  ceb     gch   ceb  ceb   A solution may be obtained thus: Since the product of b by b is a num  ber which ends in 6, b must be 1, 5, or 6. Since the product of ab by b  is a number of three digits, b cannot be 1. The result of the subtraction  of h from e is e, hence h = 0, and therefore if b = 5 we have / even, and  if b = 6 we have / = 5. Also the result of the subtraction of e from g  is c, hence g = 2c, and therefore c cannot be greater than 4: from which  it follows that b cannot be 6. A few trials now show that the question  arose from the division of 19,775 by 35.   It is possible to frame digit restoration examples of a mixed character  involving the difficulties of all the examples given above, and to increase  the difficulty by expressing them in a non-denary scale of notation. But  such elaborations do not add to the interest of the questions.   8 Strand Magazine, September-October, 1921.     // is quite a three-pipe problem.   SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE (The Red-Headed League)     1 The Seven Seven's   By W. E. H. BERWICK     THE following original problem may interest some readers of The School  World. The problem, as will be seen, consists of an ordinary long-division  sum in which some of the figures are replaced by dots. There is one, and  only one, solution possible.   W. E. H. BERWICK.

SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF THE SEVEN SEVEN'S 1   I send you herewith a solution of the interesting problem which ap  peared in last month's School World, and I have given with it, in some  detail, the process of reasoning by which the result was reached.   (1) Since multiplication of the divisor by 7 gives 6 figures in the  product, while the 2nd and 4th multiplications give 7 figures, the divisor  must begin with 11, 12, 13, or 14, and the 2nd and 4th figures of the  quotient are 8 or 9.   (2) Since the product of the divisor multiplied by 7 has its 2nd digit 7,   1 (The reader will find in an appendix, p. 2445, a much more detailed, meticulously  reasoned solution of Berwick's problem, by Callandreau, Cttebres Problemes Maih&-  matiques, Edition Albin Michel, Paris, 1949. I add this material on the theory there  are readers as intrigued as I am by this sort of logical exercise. Ed.)   2444     The Seven Seven's 2445   it is found by trial that the divisor must begin with 111, 124, 125, 138,  or 139.   (3) The 3rd remainder must evidently begin with 10, and therefore  also the 4th product begins with 10. Hence either divisor begins with 111,  and 4th figure of quotient is 9, or divisor begins 125, and 4th figure of  quotient is 8.   (4) But if 9 were the 4th figure of the quotient, then, since the product  has its 3rd digit from the right 7, the divisor would require to begin with  11197, which would make the product by 7 have an 8 in the 2nd place  instead of a 7. Hence the 4th figure in the quotient is 8, and the divisor  begins with 12547, the 6th figure being less than 5.   (5) Since the 3rd product (by 7) begins 878, and the line above can  not be greater than 979 . . ., therefore the remainder begins 101; and  since the 4th product begins 100, therefore the last remainder begins with  a 1, and the last figure of the quotient must be 1.   (6) On trying 4, 3, 2, 1 in succession as 6th digit in the divisor, and  working the division backwards, it is found that the 2nd of these alone  satisfies the conditions not yet considered, and that the following is the  full division.   1 254(7)3 ) 73@54284 1 3 ( 5 8 8 1  627365     1101 7(7)8  1003784   9(7)9 944  8(7)8 3 1 1   1016331  1 3@8 4   125473  125473     J.

This odd problem, which illustrates well the power of quite elementary  arithmetic, was proposed and solved by Berwick in 1906, in the review  The School World.   Denoting the missing figures by letters, the operation may be written   a r 87e|AB7CDELQWZ'U'X7^ (1st Line)  a b x c d e (2nd Line)     FGHJK7L (3rdLine)   f gh jky 1   M7NOPQ   m 7 n o p q   RSTUzVW  r s t u 7 v w     XYZX'Y'Z'  XYZX'Y'Z'   The first figure a of the divisor must be 1 for the product 7A in the  sixth line has only six figures; even with a = 2 it would have to have  seven.   Considering now the partial remainders in the third and seventh lines,  since they each have six figures F and R must be equal to unity, for  FGHJK7 and RSTUZV are each less than ayS7 e , and a is equal to unity.  So F = R = 1 and therefore also f = r = 1.   The divisor A' therefore cannot be greater than 199,979 and since p is  not greater than 9 the partial product in the eighth line is at most  1,799,811, so s is less than 8. But since S is the difference of the two figures  7 in the column immediately above it S must be either 9 or 0. Now in the  ninth line the remainders (R r) and (S s) are zero, and R = r = 1  therefore S = s = 0. Further, with S = and R = 1 it follows that  M = m -f 1, therefore m ^ 8. So the partial product in the sixth line is  at most 87nopq.     The Seven Seven's 2447   The second figure ft of the divisor can only be equal to 0, 1 or 2; for  if it were 3 or more the divisor would be at least 130,000, and multiplica  tion of this by 7 gives 910,000, which is greater than 87nopq. Suppose  ft=0: the divisor is then at most 109,979, the product of which with  the highest possible figure, 9, of the quotient still gives a partial product  of six figures; but at the eighth line the partial product has seven figures.  ft must therefore be greater than 0. Suppose ft = 1 : then y can only be  equal to or 1, for if y ^ 2 the partial product 7 A will give for the sec  ond figure of the sixth line a figure greater than 7; but 7 cannot be 0,  for even with a figure 9 in the quotient the partial product 9 X 110,979  would not have seven figures, as it must have at the eighth line. Assum  ing that y = 1, we must determine 8, e, ^ in such a way that the partial  product IJL X lll,87e gives a seven-figure number in which the third figure  from the right is 7. ^ must be equal to 9, for ^ = 8 would give a six-  figure number; it follows that 8 must be equal to or 9. In the first case  the divisor would be at most 110,979 and its multiple by the highest figure  9 of the quotient would not give a seven-figure number as required. In  the second case the divisor would be lll,97e which on multiplication by 7  would give for the sixth line 783 . . . , which is impossible since the  second figure from the left must be a 7. Therefore ft cannot be equal to 1.  Therefore it must be equal to 2, from which it follows that m = 8 and  M=9.   We have then that the partial product in the sixth line is 7 X 12y87e  and this must be equal to 87nopq; it follows that y must be 4 or 5, for  7 X 126S7e would be greater than 87nopq, and 7 X 123,979 would be  less than this number. Now 7 X 126,979 would still give a partial product  of six figures, instead of the seven required for the eighth line (10tu7vw,  say), and 9 X 123,979 would be greater than it; so /i = 8, and since for  y 4 the maximum value of the partial product in the eighth line would  be 8 X 124,979 and thus less than 10tu7vw, y must be equal to 5.   But the partial product 8 X 125S7e, that is 10tu7vw, must have the third  figure from the right equal to 7, which is only possible for 8 = 4 or 9;  but 7 X 125 ,97 would give a partial product greater than 87nopq in the  sixth line, so 8 = 4, and it will be seen also that c cannot be greater than  4. From this we conclude that n = 8; and the partial product 10tu7vw in  the eighth line is 8 X 125,47e, so that t = and u = 3.   X, not being zero, is ^ 1, so that T ^ 1; but since n = 8 and N ^ 9  we have T ^ 1, so that T must be equal to 1. Consequently N = 9 and  X~ 1. The partial product v X 125 ,47 in the tenth line requires v= 1  since X=l. From this it follows that Y = 2, Z = 5, X' = 4 f Y':=7,  and Z' = .   The partial product X X 125, 47 e gives at the fourth line a seven-figure  number, from which it follows that \ must be equal to 8 or 9.     2448 w - E - H - Berwick   Suppose e = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in turn, with X = 8 or 9: the partial products  in the fourth, sixth and eighth lines are determined, and on reconstructing  the division we must have a 7 as the second figure from the right on the  third line. Trial and error shows that this is satisfied only in the case  X = 8 and e = 3. The partial products may now be obtained, giving  vw = 84, opq = 311, ghjkyl = 003,784; from which it follows that UzVW  = 6,331, OPQ = 944, and GHJK7L = 101,778.   It only remains to determine the first and second lines, and i. The first  partial product in the second line, i X 125,473, must give a number which  added to the remainder 110,177 gives a 7 in the third place from the left  in the dividend. Only i = 5 will do this. The quotient and the divisor are  thus completely determined; it follows that abxcde = 627,365 and finally  that the dividend AB7CDE = 737,542.     COMMENTARY ON   THOMAS JOHN I'ANSON  BROMWICH     rpHOMAS JOHN FANSON BROMWICH (1875-1929) was an Eng-  A lish mathematician and, for all I know, a tennis player but not the  tennis player. Bromwich was noted for his work in algebra, his encyclo  pedic treatise The Theory of Infinite Series, and certain classic researches  in mathematical physics. He lectured for some years at St. John's College,  Cambridge, and was a Fellow of the Royal Society. Bromwich was an  enthusiastic exponent of the "elementary dynamics of the lawn tennis  court," a subject which, in its mathematical form, at least, does notappear  to have a wide following. Those who regard tennis as too important to be  left to the mercy of crude empirics will wish to study carefully the analysis  presented below.   You will note that Bromwich says the mathematics of his essay is easy.  This opinion, I have learned, is debatable among tennis players. Most of  those whom I consulted implied they would rather play a dozen sets of  singles in Death Valley than sweat through Bromwich's algebra. I do not  guarantee that the tactics here outlined actually work; it may be that  their effectiveness can be realized only hi the form of gamesmanship. A  few words about V2gt 2 and parabolic trajectories might well be helpful if  spoken when your opponent is about to serve or smash. Bromwich's re  minder that "few ladies will volley with any real confidence" evidently  refers to a sort of lady that used to volley with Cambridge dons. The  tactic based on this assumption is no longer recommended.     2449     You know my methods. Apply them.   SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE (The Sign of Four)     8 Easy Mathematics and  Lawn Tennis   By T. J. FA. BROMWICH     IN VIEW of the popular appeal of Lawn Tennis, and of the fact that a  large number of professional mathematicians depend upon this game for  much of their recreation, it seems strange that no one has pointed out that  a good deal may be learned (as to suitable tactics) by applying a few  quite simple principles of dynamics and geometry to the game.   The following remarks refer to the game as played in a men's double: 1  after the age of thirty-five the players usually cease to take very great in  terest in a strenuous men's single, and (at about the same age) less anxiety  to play in mixed doubles will be found. And once the ideas have been sug  gested which govern these tactics in a double, any one really interested  will have little difficulty in working out similar rules for singles, or for  mixed doubles, where it must be borne in mind that few ladies will volley  with any real confidence.   In the first place, any student of geometry will have no difficulty in see  ing that for a pair to cover the court (with as little trouble to themselves  as possible) they should adopt a formation in which the line joining the  players is parallel to the net (or nearly so) ; and again it is easy to see that  the most really vulnerable area is BETWEEN the two players, rather than  the areas which are left outside the players (that is, between each player  and the nearer side-line).   These are, of course, general principles; they cannot be of universal  application, and they must be modified in the light of the known methods  of play and the special personality of individual opponents. For this  reason closeness to the net has the further advantage (apart from the  mathematical reasons given below) that the probable play of the attackers  can be studied more easily, and their strokes (to some extent) anticipated  in consequence of the knowledge so gained.   The court is taken as a rectangle 80 2 feet by 32 feet, and the net as  3 feet high.   1 The players are supposed also to be right-handed; the necessary modifications due  to one or two left-handed players can be easily introduced, but no new ideas are in  volved.   2 Accurately 78 feet; but exact figures are not very valuable here.     2450     Easy Mathematics and Lawn Tennis   ELEMENTARY DYNAMICS OF THE LAWN TENNIS COURT     2451     Although the actual flight of the ball must be greatly affected by air-  resistance, yet we can get an idea of the general character of the problem  by using the familiar parabolic trajectory. 3 Take then the height of the net  as h, and suppose that a ball is to be hit at a height h Q so as to skim the  net and just fall into the court; we take the distances from the net to be  x 9 / respectively.      FIGURE 1   Then if u is the horizontal component of velocity we easily find that   h h h g Vsigt 2   + - = (x + 7) =   x I 2u 2 x + l   where t is the whole time of flight.   From the point of view of the driver, it is of very great importance to  make t small (so as to give his opponent little time to anticipate the  stroke); and accordingly, h being partly at his disposal, we have the  FIRST WORKING RULE: Take the ball as high above the ground as possible.   To consider the effect of position, we may write the formula as     = (A -     and in the subsequent discussion there is one fundamental difference,  according as /z is greater or less than h: for definiteness we may distin  guish these alternatives as the smash and the drive. The latter may be  considered first.   The Drive.   Here 7z < h\ and thus (h h )/h is positive, but it will be supposed  fairly small, say about %; that is, the height h will be %/x (= 2 ft. 3 in.).  Thus:   %*/ 2 "     3 In actual play, the flight is modified a good deal by "cut" and "top-spin." The  former is a very important feature in Court-Tennis, and consequently figured largely  in the early days of lawn-tennis in modern good fast play, "cut" is almost non  existent. "Top-spin" on the other hand may be seen often, but its effect is too compli  cated to be considered here.     J. /. I'A. Bromwich   2452   and so the value of t is least for x = %/, and then is f a where  * 2 =%6(%) = 2 %4, or * = %(5'2) = -65 sec.   This corresponds to a distance of some 20 feet from the net, if the  driver aims at the back-line; but in practice it is usual to come up to, say,  10 or 12 feet, and to aim at a point perhaps 30 feet beyond the net. The  value is then   ), orf!= -66 sec.,     but the slight increase in time for this stroke is more than compensated by  the gain to be found in smashes. The speed u is about 60 ft./sec. in the  second position and nearly 90 ft./sec. in the former.   The Smash.*   Here h Q > h; to have a clear idea of the magnitudes involved, we shall  suppose h to be from 4 to 5 feet; and so an average value for (h - h )/h  would be -%. It is now evident that x must be as small as possible (to  reduce t as far as may be). But as x is decreased, it is evident that the  negative term (the first) in the formula will overpower the positive term:  this simply indicates the fact (familiar in all net-play) that the net is no  longer any real obstacle. Then the racket usually directs the ball slightly  downwards: but to make an easier calculation, let us suppose that the  stroke is horizontal and then we have the two simple formulae:     These give t = 5 (for /z a = 4 feet)   and = 80 ft./sec. (taking x + / = 40 feet) .   The Base-line Drive.   Here we shall have # = /, at least approximately, and so  (2h A ) ; nowadays it is usual to take the ball at a height of perhaps  2 feet, so that again t is about ?, but the necessary speed is considerably  greater, and would seem to be at least 100 ft/sec. Since the energy varies  as the square of the initial speed, the amount of energy used in a base-line  drive is about three times as much as from a point 10 feet from the net.   GEOMETRY APPLIED TO THE QUESTION OF POSITION IN THE COURT   If the opponent is driving from the base-line (unless he possesses excep  tional skill) he is almost forced to aim at the base-line (of course a lob  can be dropped on the side-lines, but lobs must be treated on other prin  ciples). Thus, at a distance of 10 feet from the net, a length of ( 8 ^-)  32 = 20 feet is exposed to fire: thus each player is responsible for 10   4 In what is usually called "smashing" the ball will be hit at a height of 6 or 7  feet: here we have used the phrase smash as a conveniently short phrase to distin  guish the two types of stroke.     Easy Mathematics and Lawn Tennis 2453   feet to be covered. It is a matter of common experience that few players  can aim quite accurately at the corners of the court, so that probably  not more than 9 feet needs to be covered by each player, but there is      FIGURE 2   more need to cover the inside than the outside. The length to be covered  by the left-hand player has been thickened in the figure. It is to be care  fully noticed that, in order to provide the best cover, the players (repre  sented by M, N) should move to their RIGHT, following the position of  the driver at P.   The players should, therefore, try to form mental pictures of the area  into which driving is possible, so as to place themselves to the best possible  advantage along A'B'. Once this idea is grasped, the mind quickly indi  cates suitable points for defence; of course, in trying to defend against a  smash, the problem is far more complicated, since then cross-shots  are comparatively easy. Still the same principles can be used as a  guide.   It is not difficult to apply similar considerations to the position of the  server's partner: he must first decide, after observing the pitch of the  service, whether there is any real danger of being passed at the side-line.  When the pitch is near the centre-line, a passing shot is so difficult that  this risk is almost negligible; then the player will be well-advised to move  towards the centre-line of his court (so as to help the server to cover the  danger zone). But if the pitch is near the side-line, a passing-shot is quite  likely, and the player must remain as close to the side-line as is necessary  to cover it; for the server will be fully engaged in trying to cover the rest  of the court. As to the server himself, in either case his (further) side-line  will be in little danger, and his best policy is to come up towards the  centre-line, keeping a watch on his partner, so as to cover up any possible  gap between them.     -.-, T. 3. VA. Bromwich     POSTSCRIPT   About three weeks after putting down the above formulae I was asked  by a lady player if there was an explanation (by mathematics) of a state  ment made by Senorita Alvarez to the effect that // a ball is ABOVE the  shoulder it may be hit at ANY speed, without being driven out of court,  provided that the ball GRAZES THE NET.   This statement can easily be justified by the same formulae; but it is a  little easier to write down first some general formulae (from which our  earlier formulae were found in the first place). The parabolic trajectory  is used (as already explained); then suppose that u, v are the horizontal  and vertical components of the initial velocity, and that / is the time to  the net. Then we have     x u a u   h A - h      Thus     and so   a x   From this formula those used previously will follow instantly.  For our immediate purpose we note that (h h)/x and also %gf are  both positive.   h h$ h x hy h   Thus; - > or - > .   a x ah   Accordingly, then // /z ^ 2h (i.e. 6 #.), no ball can possibly be driven  out.   In the play of a person of moderate height it is perhaps reasonable to  reckon "shoulder-height" at about 5 ft. 6 in. Then we have      h   and so (a x) < %a.   This means that, unless the driver is within 6 feet (say) of the base  line, a ball at the level of the head cannot be driven out, however hard the  ball is hit (keeping it down to the net).     COMMENTARY ON   STEPHEN BUTLER LEACOCK     QTEPHEN BUTLER LEACOCK, who died in 1944, was a political  O economist head of department at McGill University and the  author of a number of very funny short stories and essays. I have never  understood why it was considered so remarkable that an economist should  also be a humorist. Economics is apt to parch those who practice it and  it is not surprising to find them turning to humor for relief. Leacock has  been described as a "genial satirist." He was not genial. It is true that he  was inclined more to use the flat of his sword than the point or edge; but  he was much too aware of society's follies to be genial. He had a sharp eye  for every sort of idiot's delight and a delightful way of arraigning the  world's ample stupidity. Much of his earlier writing he was most prolific  from 1910 to 1925 has gone flat, but there are pieces in Nonsense  Novels, Behind the Beyond, Frenzied Fiction and Winnowed Wisdom that  still sparkle. Burlesque was Leacock's greatest skill. He knew about science  and enjoyed deflating its pretensions. The essay Mathematics for Golfers  uses arithmetic to dissolve a few of the solemn principles of this pompous  and snobbish game that was obviously invented to kill off overweight  executives on Sundays. Common Sense and the Universe discusses irrever  ently some of the holiest mathematical concepts in this book, from  probability and quantum theory to relativity and entropy. I wish that  Bishop Berkeley could have lived to take on these theories as he took  on the calculus; Leacock's treatment is less pungent he was not an  Irishman but no less gratifying.     2455     When ye come to play golf ye maun hae a heid.   CHARLES BAIRD MACDONALD (1928)     Mathematics for Golfers   By STEPHEN LEACOCK     IT is only quite recently that I have taken up golf. In fact I have played  for only three or four years, and seldom more than ten games in a week,  or at most four in a day. I have had a proper golf vest for only two years.  I bought a "spoon*' only this year and I am not going to get Scotch socks  till next year.   In short, I am still a beginner. I have once, it is true, had the distinction  "of making a hole in one," in other words, of hitting the ball into the pot,  or can, or receptacle, in one shot. That is to say, after I had hit, a ball  was found in the can, and my ball was not found. It is what we call  circumstantial evidence the same thing that people are hanged for.   Under such circumstances I should have little to teach to anybody about  golf. But it has occurred to me that from a certain angle my opinions  may be of value. I at least bring to bear on the game all the resources of  a trained mind and all the equipment of a complete education.   In particular I may be able to help the ordinary golfer, or "goofer"  others prefer "gopher" by showing him something of the application of  mathematics to golf.   Many a player is perhaps needlessly discouraged by not being able to  calculate properly the chances and probabilities of progress in the game.  Take for example the simple problem of "going round in bogey." The  ordinary average player, such as I am now becoming something between  a beginner and an expert necessarily wonders to himself, "Shall I ever  be able to go around in bogey; will the time ever come when I shall  make not one hole in bogey, but all the holes?"   To this, according to my calculations, the answer is overwhelmingly  "yes." The thing is a mere matter of time and patience.   Let me explain for the few people who never play golf (such as night  watchmen, night clerks in hotels, night operators, and astronomers) that  "bogey" is an imaginary player who does each hole at golf in the fewest  strokes that a first-class player with ordinary luck ought to need for  that hole.   Now an ordinary player finds it quite usual to do one hole out of the  nine "in bogey" as we golfers, or rather, "us goofers" call it; but he  wonders whether it will ever be his fate to do all the nine holes of the   2456     Mathematics for Golfers 2457   course in bogey. To which we answer again with absolute assurance, he  wffl.   The thing is a simple instance of what is called the mathematical theory  of probability. If a player usually and generally makes one hole in bogey,  or comes close to it, his chance of making any one particular hole in  bogey is one in nine. Let us say, for easier calculation, that it is one in  ten. When he makes it, his chance of doing the same with the next hole  is also one in ten; therefore, taken from the start, his chance of making  the two holes successively in bogey is one-tenth of a tenth chance. In  other words, it is one in a hundred.   The reader sees already how encouraging the calculation is. Here is at  last something definite about his progress. Let us carry it farther. His  chance of making three holes in bogey one after the other will be one  in 1000, his chance of four one in 10,000, and his chance of making the  whole round in bogey will be exactly one in 1,000,000,000 that is one  in a billion games.   In other words, all he has to do is to keep right on. But for how long?  he asks. How long will it take, playing the ordinary number of games in  a month, to play a billion? Will it take several years? Yes, it will.   An ordinary player plays about 100 games in a year, and will, there  fore, play a billion games in exactly 10,000,000 years. That gives us  precisely the time it will need for persons like the reader and myself to  go round in bogey.   Even this calculation needs a little revision. We have to allow for the  fact that in 10,000,000 years the shrinking of the earth's crust, the  diminishing heat of the sun, and the general slackening down of the  whole solar system, together with the passing of eclipses, comets, and  showers of meteors, may put us off our game.   In fact, I doubt if we shall ever get around in bogey. Let us try some  thing else. Here is a very interesting calculation in regard to "allowing for  the wind."   I have noticed that a great many golf players of my own particular  class are always preoccupied with the question of "allowing for the wind."  My friend Amphibius Jones, for example, just before driving always  murmurs something, as if in prayer, about "allowing for the wind." After  driving he says with a sigh, "I didn't allow for the wind." In fact, all  through my class there is a general feeling that our game is practically  ruined by the wind. We ought really to play in the middle of the Desert  of Sahara where there isn't any.   It occurred to me that it might be interesting to reduce to a formula  the effect exercised by the resistance of the wind on a moving golf ball.  For example, in our game of last Wednesday, Jones in his drive struck  the ball with what, he assures me, was his full force, hitting it with abso-     2^ Stephen Leacock   lute accuracy, as he himself admits, fair in the center, and he himself  feeling, on his own assertion, absolutely fit, his eye being (a very neces  sary thing with Jones) absolutely "in," and he also having on his proper  sweater a further necessary condition of first-class play. Under all the  favorable circumstances the ball advanced only 50 yards! It was evident  at once that it was a simple matter of the wind: the wind, which was of  that treacherous character that blows over the links unnoticed, had im  pinged full upon the ball, pressed it backward, and forced it to the earth.   Here, then, is a neat subject of calculation. Granted that Jones as  measured on a hitting machine the week the circus was here can hit 2  tons, and that this whole force was pressed against a golf ball only one inch  and a quarter in diameter. What happens? My reader will remember that  the superficial area of a golf ball is ;rr 3 , that is 3.141567 X (% inches) 3 . 1  And all of this driven forward with the power of 4000 pounds to the inch!   In short, taking Jones's statements at their face value, the ball would  have traveled, had it not been for the wind, no less than 6 l /z miles.   I give next a calculation of even more acute current interest. It is in  regard to "moving the head." How often is an admirable stroke at golf  spoiled by moving the head! It have seen members of our golf club sit  silent and glum all evening, murmuring from time to time, "I moved my  head." When Jones and I play together I often hit the ball sideways into  the vegetable garden from which no ball returns (they have one of these  on every links; it is a Scottish invention). And whenever I do so Jones  always says, "You moved your head." In return when he drives his ball  away up into the air and down again ten yards in front of him, I always  retaliate by saying, "You moved your head, old man."   In short, if absolute immobility of the head could be achieved, the  major problem of golf would be solved.   Let us put the theory mathematically. The head, poised on the neck,  has a circumferential sweep or orbit of about 2 inches, not counting the  rolling of the eyes. The circumferential sweep of a golf ball is based on  a radius of 250 yards, or a circumference of about 1600 yards, which is  very nearly equal to a mile. Inside this circumference is an area of  27,878,400 square feet, the whole of which is controlled by a tiny move  ment of the human neck. In other words, if a player were to wiggle his  neck even 1/190 of an inch the amount of ground on which the ball  might falsely alight would be half a million square feet. If at the same  time he multiplies the effect by rolling his eyes, the ball might alight  anywhere.   I feel certain that after reading this any sensible player will keep his  head still.   1 [I hope it is not too heavy handed to point out that the formulae are wrong and  the mathematics egregious. ED.]     Mathematics for Golfers 2459   A further calculation remains and one perhaps of even greater prac  tical interest than the ones above.   Everybody who plays golf is well aware that on some days he plays  better than on others. Question How often does a man really play his  game?   I take the case of Amphibius Jones. There are certain days, when he is,  as he admits himself, "put off his game" by not having on his proper golf  vest. On other days the light puts him off his game; at other times the  dark; so, too, the heat; or again the cold. He is often put off his game  because he has been up late the night before; or similarly because he has  been to bed too early the night before; the barking of a dog always puts  him off his game; so do children; or adults; or women. Bad news disturbs  his game; so does good; so also does the absence of news.   All of this may be expressed mathematically by a very simple applica  tion of the theory of permutations and probability; let us say that there  are altogether 50 forms of disturbance any one of which puts Jones off  his game. Each one of these disturbance happens, say, once in ten days.  What chance is there that a day will come when not a single one of them  occurs? The formula is a little complicated, but mathematicians will   X X 2 X*   recognize the answer at once as - H h .In fact, that is   1 1 1   X X 2 AT n   exactly how often Jones plays at his best; I ... worked out in   1 1 1   time and reckoning four games to the week and allowing for leap years  and solar eclipses, comes to about once in 2,930,000 years.  And from watching Jones play I think that this is about right.     In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower Mississippi  has shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles. That is an average  of a trine over one mile and a third per year. Therefore, any calm person,  who is not blind or idiotic, can see that in the old Oolitic Silurian Period,  lust a million years ago next November, the Lower Mississippi River was  upward of one million three hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out  over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod. And by the same token any  person can see that seven hundred and forty-two years from now the  Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and three-quarters long, and Cairo  and New Orleans will have joined their streets together, and be plodding  comfortably alons under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen.  There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale  returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.   MARK TWAIN (Life on the Mississippi)     10 Common Sense and the Universe   By STEPHEN LEACOCK     SPEAKING last December [1941] at the annual convention of the Amer  ican Association for the Advancement of Science, and speaking, as it  were, in the name of the great 100-inch telescope under his control,  Professor Edwin Hubble, of the Mount Wilson Observatory, California,  made the glad announcement that the universe is not expanding. This  was good news indeed, if not to the general public who had no reason  to suspect that it was expanding, at least to those of us who humbly  attempt to 'follow science.' For some twenty-five years past, indeed ever  since the promulgation of this terrific idea in a paper published by Pro  fessor W. de Sitter in 1917, we had lived as best we could in an expanding  universe, one in which everything, at terrific speed kept getting further  away from everything else. It suggested to us the disappointed lover in  the romance who leaped on his horse and rode madly off in all directions.  The idea was majestic in its sheer size, but it somehow gave an uncom  fortable sensation.   Yet we had to believe it. Thus, for example, we had it on the authority  of Dr. Spencer Jones, the British Astronomer Royal, as recently as in his  new and fascinating book of 1940, Life on Other Worlds, that 'a distant  universe in the constellation of Bootes has been found to be receding  with a velocity of 24,300 miles a second. We can infer that this nebula  is at a distance of 230,000,000 light-years.' I may perhaps remind my  fellow followers of science that a light-year means the distance traveled  in one year by light, moving at 186,000 miles a second. In other words,   2460     Common Sense and the Universe 2461   this 'distant universe' is now 1,049,970,980,000,000,000,000 miles away.   Some distance! as Mr. Churchill would say.   But now it appears that that distant universe has not been receding  at all; in fact, it isn't away out there. Heaven knows where it is. Bring it  back. Yet not only did the astronomers assert the expansion but they  proved it, from the behavior of the red band in the spectrum, which  blushed a deeper red at the revelation of it, like the conscious water that  'saw its God and blushed' at Cana in Galilee long ago. One of the most  distinguished and intelligible of our astronomers, Sir Arthur Eddington,  had written a book about it, The Expanding Universe, to bring it down  to our level. Astronomers at large accepted this universal explosion in all  directions as calmly as they once accepted the universal fall of gravita  tion, or the universal death in the cold under Carnot's Second Law of  Thermodynamics.   But the relief brought by Professor Hubble is tempered on reflection  by certain doubts and afterthoughts. It is not that I venture any disbelief  or disrespect toward science, for that is as atrocious in our day as disbelief  in the Trinity in the days of Isaac Newton. But we begin to doubt whether  science can quite keep on believing in and respecting itself. If we expand  today and contract tomorrow; if we undergo all the doubled-up agonies  of the curvature of space only to have the kink called off, as it has been;  if we get reconciled to dying a martyr's death at one -general, distributed  temperature of 459 degrees below zero, the same for all, only to find that  the world is perhaps unexpectedly warming up again then we ask, where  are we? To which, of course, Einstein answers *Nowhere,' since there is  no place to be. So we must pick up our little book again, follow science,  and wait for the next astronomical convention.   Let us take this case of the famous Second Law of Thermodynamics,  that inexorable scroll of fate which condemned the universe or at least  all life in it to die of cold. I look back now with regret to the needless  tears I have wasted over that, the generous sympathy for the last little  band of survivors, dying at 459 degrees below our zero (273 centi  grade), the absolute zero of cold when the molecules cease to move and  heat ends. No stove will light at that, for the wood is as cold as the stove,  and the match is as cold as both, and the dead fingers motionless.   I remember meeting this inexorable law for the first time in reading, as  a little boy, a piece of 'popular science' entitled Our Great Timepiece  Running Down. It was by Richard Proctor, whose science-bogeys were as  terrifying as Mrs. Crow's Night Thoughts, only slower in action. The sun,  it appeared, was cooling; soon it would be all over. Lord Kelvin presently  ratified this. Being Scotch, he didn't mind damnation and he gave the  sun and whole solar system only ninety million years more to live.   This famous law was first clearly enunciated in 1824 by the great     Stephen Leacoek  2462   French physicist, Nicolas Carnot. It showed that all bodies in the universe  kept changing their temperaturehot things heated cold, and cold things  chilled hot. Thus they pooled their temperature. Like the division of a  rich estate among a flock of poor relations, it meant poverty for all. We  must all share ultimately the cold of absolute space.   It is true that a gleam of hope came when Ernest Rutherford and  others, working on radioactivity, discovered that there might be a contrary  process of 'stoking up,' Atoms exploding into radioactivity would keep  the home fires burning in the sun for a long time. This glad news meant  that the sun was both much older and much younger than Lord Kelvin  had ever thought it was. But even at that it was only a respite. The best  they could offer was 1,500,000,000 years. After that we freeze.   And now what do you think! Here comes the new physics of the Quan  tum Theory and shatters the Second Law of Thermodynamics into gas a  word that is Dutch for chaos. The world may go on forever. All of this  because of the final promulgation of the Law of the Quantum, or, shall  we say, the Law of the Just So Much, of which we shall presently speak.  These physical people do not handle their Latin with the neat touch of  those of us who knew our declensions as they know their dimensions. Of  course they mean Tantum but let it go at that. Quantum is drugstore  Latin, quantum sufficit. Tantum is the real thing Virgilium vidi tantum  (*I saw something of Virgil' ).   At this point I may perhaps pause to explain that the purpose of this  article is not to make fun of science, nor to express disbelief in it, but  only to suggest its limits. What I want to say is that when the scientist  steps out from recording phenomena and offers a general statement of the  nature of what is called 'reality,' the ultimate nature of space, of time, of  the beginning of things, of life, of a universe, then he stands exactly where  you and I do, and the three of us stand where Plato did and long before  him, Rodin's primitive thinker.   Consider this. Professor Hubble, like Joshua, has called upon the uni  verse to be still. All is quiet. The universe rests, motionless, in the night  sky. The mad rush is over. Every star in every galaxy, every island uni  verse, is at least right where it is. But the old difficulty remains: Does  it go forever, this world in the sky, or does it stop? Such an alternative  has posed itself as a problem for every one of us, somewhere about the  age of twelve. We cannot imagine that the stars go on forever. It's un  thinkable. But we equally cannot imagine that they come to a stop and  that beyond them is nothing, and then more nothing. Unending nothing  is as incomprehensible as unending something. This alternative I cannot  fathom, nor can Professor Hubble, nor can anyone ever hope to.   Let me turn back in order to make my point of view a little clearer. I  propose to traverse again the path along which modem science has     Common Sense and the Universe 2463   dragged those who have tried to follow it for about a century past. It  was at first a path singularly easy to tread, provided that one could throw  aside the inherited burden of superstition, false belief, and prejudice. For  the direction seemed verified and assured all along by the corroboration  of science by actual physical results. Who could doubt electricity after  the telegraph? Or doubt the theory of light after photography? Or the  theory of electricity when read under electric light? At every turn, each  new advance of science unveiled new power, new mechanism of life and  of death. To 'doubt science' was to be like the farmer at the circus who  doubted the giraffe. Science, of course, had somehow to tuck into the  same bed as Theology, but it was the theologian who protested. Science  just said, Tie over.*   Let us follow then this path.     When mediaeval superstition was replaced by the new learning, mathe  matics, astronomy, and physics were the first sciences to get organized and  definite. By the opening of the nineteenth century they were well set; the  solar system was humming away so drowsily that Laplace was able to  assure Napoleon that he didn't need God to watch over it. Gravitation  worked like clockwork and clockwork worked like gravitation. Chemistry,  which, like electricity, was nothing but a set of experiments in Benjamin  Franklin's time, turned into a science after Lavoisier had discovered that  fire was not a thing but a process, something happening to things an idea  so far above the common thought that they guillotined him for it in  1794. Dalton followed and showed that all things could be broken up into  a set of very, very small atoms, grouped into molecules all acting accord  ing to plan. With Faraday and Maxwell, electricity, which turned out to  be the same as magnetism, or interchangeable with it, fell into its place  in the new order of science.   By about 1880 it seemed as if the world of science was fairly well ex  plained. Metaphysics still talked in its sleep. Theology still preached ser  mons. It took issue with much of the new science, especially with geology  and the new evolutionary science of life that went with the new physical  world. But science paid little attention.   For the whole thing was so amazingly simple. There you had your  space and time, two things too obvious to explain. Here you had your  matter, made up of solid little atoms, infinitely small but really just like  birdseed. All this was set going by and with the Law of Gravitation. Once  started, the nebulous world condensed into suns, the suns threw off  planets, the planets cooled, life resulted and presently became conscious,  conscious life got higher up and higher up till you had apes, then Bishop  Wilberforce, and then Professor Huxley.     2464 Stephen Leacock   A few little mysteries remained, such as the question of what space and  matter and time and life and consciousness really were. But all this was  conveniently called by Herbert Spencer the Unknowable, and then locked  in a cupboard and left there.   Everything was thus reduced to a sort of Dead Certainty. Just one  awkward skeleton remained in the cupboard. And that was the peculiar,  mysterious aspect of electricity, which was not exactly a thing and yet  more than an idea. There was also, and electricity only helped to make it  worse, the old puzzle about 'action at a distance. 5 How does gravitation  pull all the way from here to the sun? And if there is nothing hi space,  how does light get across from the sun in eight minutes, and even all  the way from Sinus in eight years?   Even the invention of 'ether' as a sort of universal jelly that could have  ripples shaken across it proved a little unconvincing.   Then, just at the turn of the century the whole structure began to  crumble.   The first note of warning that something was going wrong came with  the discovery of X-rays. Sir William Crookes, accidentally leaving round  tubes of rarefied gas, stumbled on 'radiant matter,' or 'matter in the fourth  state,' as accidentally as Columbus discovered America. The British Gov  ernment knighted him at once (1897) but it was too late. The thing had  started. Then came Guglielmo Marconi with the revelation of more waves,  and universal at that. Light, the world had learned to accept, because we  can see it, but this was fun in the dark.   There followed the researches of the radioactivity school and, above all,  those of Ernest Rutherford which revolutionized the theory of matter. I  knew Rutherford well as we were colleagues at McGill for seven years.  I am quite sure that he had no original intention of upsetting the founda  tions of the universe. Yet that is what he did and he was in due course  very properly raised to the peerage for it.   When Rutherford was done with the atom all the solidity was pretty  well knocked out of it.   Till these researches began, people commonly thought of atoms as  something like birdseed, little round solid particles, ever so little, billions  to an inch. They were small. But they were there. You could weigh them.  You could apply to them all the laws of Isaac Newton about weight and  velocity and mass and gravitation in other words, the whole of first-year  physics.   Let us try to show what Rutherford did to the atom. Imagine to your  self an Irishman whirling a shillelagh round his head with the rapidity and  dexterity known only in Tipperary or Donegal. If you come anywhere  near you'll get hit with the shillelagh. Now make it go faster; faster still;  get it going so fast that you can't tell which is Irishman and which is     Common Sense and the Universe 2465   shillelagh. The whole combination has turned into a green blur. If you  shoot a bullet at it, it will probably go through, as there is mostly nothing  there. Yet if you go up against it, it won't hit you now, because the  shillelagh is going so fast that you will seem to come against a solid sur  face. Now make the Irishman smaller and the shillelagh longer. In fact  you don't need the Irishman at all; just his force, his Irish determination,  so to speak. Just keep that, the disturbance. And you don't need the  shillelagh either, just the field of force that it sweeps. There! Now put in  two Irishmen and two shillelaghs and reduce them in the same way to one  solid body at least it seems solid but you can shoot bullets through it  anywhere now. What you have now is a hydrogen atom one proton and  one electron flying round as a disturbance in space. Put in more Irishmen  and more shillelaghs or, rather, more protons and electrons and you  get other kinds of atoms. Put in a whole lot eleven protons, eleven elec  trons; that is a sodium atom. Bunch the atoms together into combinations  called molecules, themselves flying round and there you are! That's solid  matter, and nothing in it at all except disturbance. You're standing on it  right now : the molecules are beating against your feet. But there is nothing  there, and nothing in your feet. This may help you to understand how  *waves,' ripples of disturbance, for instance, the disturbance you call  radio, go right through all matter, indeed right through you, as if you  weren't there. You see, you aren't.   The peculiar thing about this atomic theory was that whatever the  atoms were, birdseed or disturbance, it made no difference to the way they  acted. They followed all the laws of mechanics and motion, or they  seemed to. There was no need to change any idea of space or time be  cause of them. Matter was their 'fort,' like wax figures with Artemus  Ward.   One must not confuse Rutherford's work on atoms with Einstein's  theories of space and time. Rutherford worked all his life without refer  ence to Einstein. Even in his later days at the Cavendish Laboratory at  Cambridge when he began, ungratefully, to smash up the 'atom that had  made him, he needed nothing from Einstein. I once asked Rutherford it  was at the height of the popular interest in Einstein, in 1923 what he  thought of Einstein's relativity. 'Oh, that stuff!' he said. We never bother  with that in our work!' His admirable biographer, Professor A. S. Eve,  tells us that when the German physicist Wien told Rutherford that no  Anglo-Saxon could understand relativity Rutherford answered, TSTo, they  have too much sense.'   But it was Einstein who made the real trouble. He announced in 1905  that there was no such thing as absolute rest. After that there never was.  But it was not till just after the Great War that the reading public caught  on to Einstein and little books on 'Relativity' covered the bookstalls.     _>,., Stephen Le acock   Z4OO   Einstein knocked out space and time as Rutherford knocked out matter.  The general viewpoint of relativity towards space is very simple. Einstein  explains that there is no such place as here. 'But,' you answer, I'm here;  here is where I am right now.' But you're moving, you're spinning round  as the earth spins; and you and the earth are both spinning round the  sun, and the sun is rushing through space towards a distant galaxy, and  the galaxy itself is beating it away at 26,000 miles a second. Now where is  that spot that is here! How did you mark it? You remember the story of  the two idiots who were out fishing, and one said, We should have marked  that place where we got all the fish,' and the other said, 'I did, I marked  it on the boat.' Well, that's it. That's here.   You can see it better still if you imagine the universe swept absolutely  empty: nothing in it, not even you. Now put a point in it, just one point.  Where is it? Why, obviously it's nowhere. If you say it's right there,  where do you mean by there? In which direction is there? In that direc  tion? Oh! hold on, you're sticking yourself in to make a direction. It's in  no direction; there aren't any directions. Now put in another point. Which  is which? You can't tell. They both are. One is on the right, you say, and  one on the left. You keep out of that space! There's no right and no  left.   The discovery by Einstein of the curvature of space was greeted by the  physicists with the burst of applause that greets a winning home-run at  baseball. That brilliant writer just mentioned, Sir Arthur Eddington, who  can handle space and time with the imagery of a poet, and even infiltrate  humor into gravitation, as when he says that a man in an elevator falling  twenty stories has an ideal opportunity to study gravitation Sir Arthur  Eddington is loud in his acclaim. Without this curve, it appears, things  won't fit into their place. The fly on the globe, as long as he thinks it flat  (like Mercator's map), finds things shifted as by some unaccountable  demon to all sorts of wrong distances. Once he gets the idea of a sphere  everything comes straight. So with our space. The mystery of gravitation  puzzles us, except those who have the luck to fall hi an elevator, and  even for them knowledge comes too late. They weren't falling at all: just  curving. 'Admit a curvature of the world,' wrote Eddington in his Gifford  Lectures of 1927, 'and the mysterious agency disappears. Einstein has  exorcised this demon.'   But it appears now, fourteen years later, that Einstein doesn't care if  space is curved or not. He can take it either way. A prominent physicist  of today, head of the department in one of the greatest universities of the  world, wrote me on this point: *Einstein had stronger hopes that a gen  eral theory which involved the assumption of a property of space, akin to  what is ordinarily called curvature, would be more useful than he now  believes to be the case.' Plain talk for a professor. Most people just say     Common Sense and the Universe 2467   Einstein has given up curved space. It's as if Sir Isaac Newton years after  had said, with a yawn, 'Oh, about that apple perhaps it wasn't falling.'   m   But unhappily we can't get away from the new physics quite as simply  as that. Even if we beat them out on space and time, there is far worse  to come. That's only the start of it, for now, as the fat boy in Pickwick  said, Tm going" to make your flesh creep.' The next thing to go is cause  and effect. You may think that one thing causes another. It appears that  it doesn't. And of course, when cause and effect go, the bottom is out of  the universe, since you can't tell, literally can't, what's going to happen  next. This is the consequence of the famous Quantum Theory, first hinted  at by Professor Max Planck about forty years ago and since then  scrambled for by the physicists like dogs after a bone. It changes so fast  that when Sir Arthur Eddington gave the Gifford Lectures referred to,  he said to his students that it might not be the same when they met next  autumn.   But we cannot understand the full impact of the Quantum Theory, in  shattering the world we lived in, without turning back again to discuss  time in a new relation, namely, the forward-and-backwardness of it, and  to connect it up again with the Second Law of Thermodynamics the  law, it will be recalled, that condemns us to die of cold. Only we will  now call it by its true name, which we had avoided before, as the Law of  Entropy. All physicists sooner or later say, *Let us call it Entropy,' just as  a man says, when you get to know him, 'Call me Charlie.'   So we make a new start.   I recall, as some other people still may, a thrilling melodrama called  The Silver King. In this the hero, who thinks he has committed a murder  (of course, he hasn't really) , falls on his knees and cries, 'Oh, God, turn  back the universe and give me yesterday.' The supposed reaction of the  audience was 'Alas, you can't turn back the universe!'   But nowadays it would be very different. At the call the Spirit of Time  would appear not Father Time, who is all wrong, being made old, but a  young, radiant spirit in a silver frock made the same back and front.  'Look,' says the Spirit, I'm going to turn back the universe. You see this  wheel turning round. Presto! It's going the other way! You see this elastic  ball falling to the floor. Presto! It's bouncing back. You see out of the  window that star moving west. Presto! It's going east. Hence accordingly/  continues the Spirit, now speaking like a professor, so that the Silver King  looks up in apprehension, 'time as evidenced by any primary motion is  entirely reversible so that we cannot distinguish between future time and  past time: indeed if they move in a circle both are one.'   The Silver King leaps up, shouts 'Innocent! Innocent!' and dashes off,     Stephen Leacock  2468   thus anticipating Act V and spoiling the whole play. The musing Spirit,  musing of course backwards, says, 'Poor fellow, I hadn't the heart to tell  him that this only applies to primary motion and not to Entropy. And  murder of course is a plain case of Entropy.'   And now let us try to explain. Entropy means the introduction into  things that happen of a random element, as opposed to things that happen  and 'unhappen,' like a turning wheel, good either way, or a ball falling  and bouncing as high as it falls, or the earth going around the sun. These  primary motions are 'reversible.' As far as they are concerned, time could  just as well go back as forward. But now consider a pack of cards fresh  from the maker, all in suits, all in order. Shuffle them. Will they ever come  all in order again? They might, but they won't. Entropy.   Here then is Entropy, the smashing down of our world by random  forces that don't reverse. The heat and cold of Carnot's Second Law are  just one case of it. This is the only way by which we can distinguish which  of two events came first. It's our only clue as to which way time is going.  If procrastination is the thief of time, Entropy is the detective.   The Quantum Theory begins with the idea that the quantities of dis  turbance in the atom, of which we spoke, are done up, at least they act  that way, in little fixed quantities (each a Quantum no more, no less),  as if sugar only existed by the pound. The smallness of the Quantum is  beyond comprehension. A Quantum is also peculiar. A Quantum in an  atom flies round in an orbit. This orbit may be a smaller ring or a bigger  ring. But when the Quantum shifts from orbit to orbit it does not pass or  drift or move from one to the other. No, sir. First, it's here and then it's  there. Believe it or not, it has just shifted. Its change of place is random,  and not because of anything. Now the things that we think of as matter  and movements and events (things happening) are all based, infinitely far  down, on this random dance of Quantums. Hence, since you can't ever  teD what a Quantum will do, you can't ever say what will happen next.  Cause and effect are all gone.   But as usual in this bright, new world of the new physics, the state  ment is no sooner made than it is taken back again. There are such a lot  of Quantums that we can feel sure that one at least will turn up in the  right place by chance, not by cause,   The only difficulty about the Quantum Theory has been that to make  the atomic 'orbits' operate properly, and to put the Quantum into two  places at once, it is necessary to have 'more dimensions' in space. If they  are not in one they are in another. You ask next door. What this means  I have no idea.   Nor does it tell us any ultimate truth about the real nature of things to  keep on making equations about them. Suppose I wish to take a holiday  trip and am selecting a place to go. I ask, How far is it? how long does it     Common Sense and the Universe 2469   take? what does it cost? These things all come into it. If I like I can call  them 'dimensions.' It does no harm. If I like I can add other dimensions  how hot it is, how much gold it has, and what sort of women. I can say,  if I wish, that the women are therefore found out to be the seventh dimen  sion of locality. But I doubt if I can find anything sillier to say than the  physicists' talk of ten and twelve dimensions added to space.   Let it be realized, I say, that making equations and functions about a  thing does not tell us anything about its real nature. Suppose that I some  times wonder just what sort of man Chipman, my fellow club member is.  While I am wondering another fellow member, a mathematician, comes  in. Wondering about Chipman, were you? 1 he says. Well, I can tell you  all about him, as I have completed his dimensions. I have here the sta  tistics of the number of times he comes (t), the number of steps he takes  before he sits down ($), his orbit in moving around (o), aberrations as  affected by other bodies (ab), velocity (v), specific gravity (sp), and his  saturation (S) . He is therefore a function of these things, or shall we say  quite simply: -     /s.v.o.sp.S  t.ab     Now this would be mathematically useful. With it I can calculate the  likelihood of my friend being at the club at any particular time, and  whether available for billiards. In other words, I've got him in what is  called a 'frame' in space-time. But just as all this tells me nothing of ulti  mate reality, neither do the super-dimensions of the new physics.   People who know nothing about the subject, or just less than I do, will  tell you that science and philosophy and theology have nowadays all come  together. So they have, in a sense. But the statement, like those above, is  just a 'statistical' one. They have come together as three people may come  together in a picture theatre, or three people happen to take apartments  in the same building, or, to apply the metaphor that really fits, as three  people come together at a funeral. The funeral is that of Dead Certainty.  The interment is over and the three turn away together.   'Incomprehensible,' murmurs Theology reverently.   'What was that word?* asks Science.   'Incomprehensible; I often use it in my litanies/   'Ah yes,' murmurs Science, with almost equal reverence, 'incompre  hensible! 5   The comprehensibility of comprehension,' begins Philosophy, staring  straight in front of him.   'Poor fellow,' says Theology, Tie's wandering again; better lead him  home.'   'I haven't the least idea where he lives,' says Science.   'Just below me,' says Theology. We're both above you.'     Index     NOTE TO INDEX: A few words of explanation are in order on the prepa  ration of this index. It was clearly neither desirable nor necessary to make  an entry for every term or concept every time it appeared; nor would it  have sensibly served the reader to list the casual opinions of a dozen  authors on, say, the importance of Archimedes, or the role of number in  the development of scientific thought. Such an index would have been  inappropriate for an anthology and would, besides, have required a sub-  index to help the reader find his way through the finder. The following  plan was adopted: All proper names and all titles of books are entered  wherever they occur. Substantive entries for concepts, ideas, operations,  symbols and the like refer to the principal definitions, explanations and  discussions. Cross-referencing adheres to the same rule.

"The whole show is dreadful," she cried, coming out of the menagerie of M. Martin. She had just been looking at that daring speculator "working with his hyena"--to speak in the style of the program.  "By what means," she continued, "can he have tamed these animals to such a point as to be certain of their affection for----."  "What seems to you a problem," said I, interrupting, "is really quite natural."  "Oh!" she cried, letting an incredulous smile wander over her lips.  "You think that beasts are wholly without passions?" I asked her. "Quite the reverse; we can communicate to them all the vices arising in our own state of civilization."  She looked at me with an air of astonishment.  "Nevertheless," I continued, "the first time I saw M. Martin, I admit, like you, I did give vent to an exclamation of surprise. I found myself next to an old soldier with the right leg amputated, who had come in with me. His face had struck me. He had one of those intrepid heads, stamped with the seal of warfare, and on which the battles of Napoleon are written. Besides, he had that frank good-humored expression which always impresses me favorably. He was without doubt one of those troopers who are surprised at nothing, who find matter for laughter in the contortions of a dying comrade, who bury or plunder him quite lightheartedly, who stand intrepidly in the way of bullets; in fact, one of those men who waste no time in deliberation, and would not hesitate to make friends with the devil himself. After looking very attentively at the proprietor of the menagerie getting out of his box, my companion pursed up his lips with an air of mockery and contempt, with that peculiar and expressive twist which superior people assume to show they are not taken in. Then when I was expatiating on the courage of M. Martin, he smiled, shook his head knowingly, and said, `Well known.'  "How `well known'? I said. `If you would only explain to me the mystery I should be vastly obliged.'     "After a few minutes, during which we made acquaintance, we went to dine at the first restaurateur's whose shop caught our eye. At dessert a bottle of champagne completely refreshed and brightened up the memories of this odd old soldier. He told me his story, and I said he had every reason to exclaim, `Well known.'"  When she got home, she teased me to that extent and made so many promises that I consented to communicate to her the old soldier's confidences. Next day she received the following episode of an epic which one might call "The Frenchman in Egypt."  During the expedition in Upper Egypt under General Desaix, a Provenal soldier fell into the hands of the Mangrabins, and was taken by these Arabs into the deserts beyond the falls of the Nile.     In order to place a sufficient distance between themselves and the French army, the Mangrabins made forced marches, and only rested during the night. They camped round a well overshadowed by palm trees under which they had previously concealed a store of provisions. Not surmising that the notion of flight would occur to their prisoner, they contented themselves with binding his hands, and after eating a few dates, and giving provender to their horses, went to sleep.  When the brave Provenal saw that his enemies were no longer watching him, he made use of his teeth to steal a scimitar, fixed the blade between his knees, and cut the cords which prevented using his hands; in a moment he was free. He at once seized a rifle and dagger, then taking the precaution to provide himself with a sack of dried dates, oats, and powder and shot, and to fasten a scimitar to his waist he leaped onto a horse, and spurred on vigorously in the direction where he thought to find the French army. So impatient was he to see a bivouac again that he pressed on the already-tired courser at such speed that its flanks were lacerated with his spurs, and at last the poor animal died, leaving the Frenchman alone in the desert. After walking some time in the sand with all the courage of an escaped convict, the soldier was obliged to stop, as the day had already ended. In spite of the beauty of an Oriental sky at night, he felt he had not strength enough to go on. Fortunately he had been able to find a small hill, on the summit of which a few palm trees shot up into the air; it was their verdure seen from afar which had brought hope and consolation to his heart. His fatigue was so great that he lay down upon a rock of granite, capriciously cut out like a camp bed; there he fell asleep without taking any precaution to defend himself while he slept. He had made the sacrifice of his life. His last thought was one of regret. He repented having left the mangrabins, whose nomad life seemed to smile on him now that he was afar from them and without help. He was awakened by the sun, whose pitiless rays fell with all their force on the granite and produced an intolerable heat for he had had the stupidity to place himself inversely to the shadow thrown by the verdant majestic heads of the palm trees. He looked at the solitary trees and shuddered--they reminded him of the graceful shafts crowned with foliage which characterize the Saracen columns in the cathedral of Arles.     But when, after counting the palm trees, he cast his eye around him, the most horrible despair was infused into his soul. Before him stretched an ocean without limit. The dark sand of the desert spread farther than sight could reach in every direction, and glittered like steel struck with a bright light. It might have been a sea of looking glass, or lakes melted together in a mirror. A fiery vapor carried up in streaks made a perpetual whirlwind over the quivering land. The sky was lit with an Oriental splendor of insupportable purity, leaving naught for the imagination to desire. Heaven and earth were on fire.  The silence was awful in its wild and terrible majesty. Infinity, immensity, closed in upon the soul from every side. Not a cloud in the sky, not a breath in the air, not a flaw on the bosom of the sand, ever moving in diminutive waves; the horizon ended as at sea on a clear day, with one line of light, definite as the cut of a sword.  The Provenal threw his arms around the trunk of one of the palm trees, as though it were the body of a friend, and then in the shelter of the thin straight shadow that the palm cast upon the granite, he wept. Then sitting down he remained as he was, contemplating with profound sadness the implacable scene, which was all he had to look upon. He cried aloud, to measure the solitude. His voice, lost in the hollows of the hill, sounded faintly, and aroused no echo--the echo was in his own heart. The Provenal was twenty-two years old; he loaded his carbine.     "There'll be time enough," he said to himself, laying on the ground the weapon which alone could bring him deliverance.  Looking by turns at the black expanse and the blue expanse, the soldier dreamed of France--he smelled with delight the gutters of Paris--he remembered the towns through which he had passed, the faces of his fellow soldiers, the most minute details of his life. His southern fancy soon showed him the stones of his beloved Provence, in the play of the heat which waved over the spread sheet of the desert. Fearing the danger of this cruel mirage, he went down the opposite side of the hill to that by which he had come up the day before. The remains of a rug showed that this place of refuge had at one time been inhabited; at a short distance he saw some palm trees full of dates. Then the instinct which binds us to life awoke again in his heart. He hoped to live long enough to await the passing of some Arabs, or perhaps he might hear the sound of cannon, for at this time Bonaparte was traversing Egypt.  This thought gave him new life. The palm tree seemed to bend with the weight of the ripe fruit. He shook some of it down. When he tasted this unhoped-for manna, he felt sure that the palms had been cultivated by a former inhabitant--the savory, fresh meat of the dates was proof of the care of his predecessor. He passed suddenly from dark despair to an almost insane joy. He went up again to the top of the hill, and spent the rest of the day in cutting down one of the sterile palm trees, which the night before had served him for shelter. A vague memory made him think of the animals of the desert; and in case they might come to drink at the spring, visible from the base of the rocks but lost farther down, he resolved to guard himself from their visits by placing a barrier at the entrance of his hermitage.  In spite of his diligence, and the strength which the fear of being devoured asleep gave him, he was unable to cut the palm in pieces, though he succeeded in cutting it down. At eventide the king of the desert fell; the sound of its fall resounded far and wide, like a sign the solitude; the soldier shuddered as though he had heard some voice predicting woe.     But like an heir who does not long bewail a deceased parent, he tore off from this beautiful tree the tall broad green leaves which are its poetic adornment, and used them to mend the mat on which he was to sleep.  Fatigued by the heat and his work, he fell asleep under the red curtains of his wet cave.  In the middle of the night his sleep was troubled by an extraordinary noise; he sat up, and the deep silence around him allowed him to distinguish the alternative accents of a respiration whose savage energy could not belong to a human creature.  A profound terror, increased still further by the darkness, the silence, and his waking images, froze his heart within him. He almost felt his hair stand on end, when by straining his eyes to their utmost he perceived through the shadows two faint yellow lights. At first he attributed these lights to the reflection of his own pupils, but soon the vivid brilliance of the night aided him gradually to distinguish the objects around him in the cave, and he beheld a huge animal lying but two steps from him. Was it a lion, a tiger, or a crocodile?  The Provenal was not educated enough to know under what species his enemy ought to be classed; but his fright was all the greater, as his ignorance led him to imagine an terrors at once; he endured a cruel torture, noting every variation of the breathing close to him without daring to make the slightest movement. An odor, pungent like that of a fox, but more penetrating, profounder--so to speak--filled the cave, and when the Provenal became sensible of this, his terror reached its height, for he could not longer doubt the proximity of a terrible companion, whose royal dwelling served him for shelter.  Presently the reflection of the moon, descending on the horizon, lit up the den, rendering gradually visible and resplendent the spotted skin of a panther.  This lion of Egypt slept, curled up like a big dog, the peaceful possessor of a sumptuous niche at the gate of a hotel; its eyes opened for a moment and closed again; its face was turned toward the man. A thousand confused thoughts passed through the Frenchman's mind first he thought of killing it with a bullet from his gun, but he saw there was not enough distance between them for him to take proper aim--the shot would miss the mark. And if it were to wake!--the thought made his limbs rigid. He listened to his own heart beating in the midst of' the silence, and cursed the too violent pulsations which the flow of blood brought on, fearing to disturb that sleep which allowed him time to think of some means of escape.     Twice he placed his hand on his scimitar, intending to cut off the head of his enemy; but the difficulty of cutting stiff, short hair compelled him to abandon this daring project. To miss would be to die for certain, he thought; he preferred the chances of fair fight, and made up his mind to wait till morning; the morning did not leave him long to wait.  He could now examine the panther at ease; its muzzle was smeared with blood.  "She's had a good dinner," he thought, without troubling himself as to whether her feast might have been on human flesh "She won't be hungry when she gets up."  It was a female. The fur on her belly and flanks was glistening white; many small marks like velvet formed beautiful bracelets round her feet; her sinuous tail was also white, ending with black rings; the overpart of her dress, yellow like unburnished gold, very lissome and soft, had the characteristic blotches the form of rosettes which distinguish the panther from every other feline species.  This tranquil and formidable hostess snored in an attitude as graceful as that of a cat lying on a cushion. Her bloodstained paws, nervous and well armed, were stretched out before her face, which rested upon them, and from which radiated her straight, slender whiskers, like threads of silver.  If she had been like that in a cage, the Provenal would doubtless have admired the grace of the animal, and the vigorous contrasts of vivid color which gave her robe an imperial splendor; but just then his sight was troubled by her sinister appearance.  The presence of the panther, even asleep, could not fail to produce the effect which the magnetic eyes of the serpent are said to have on the nightingale.  For a moment the courage of the soldier began to fail before this danger, though no doubt it would have risen at the mouth of a cannon charged with shell. Nevertheless, a bold thought brought daylight in his soul and sealed up the source of the cold sweat which sprang forth on his brow. Like men driven to bay who defy death and offer their body to the smiter, so he, seeing in this merely a tragic episode, resolved to play his part with honor to the last.  "The day before yesterday the Arabs would have killed me perhaps," he said; so considering himself as good as dead already, he waited bravely, with excited curiosity his enemy's awakening.  When the sun appeared, the panther suddenly opened her eyes; then she put out her paws with energy, as if to stretch them and get rid of cramp. At last she yawned, showing the formidable apparatus of her teeth and pointed tongue, rough as a file.  "A regular petite matresse," thought the Frenchman, seeing her roll herself about so softly and coquettishly. She licked off the blood which stained her paws and muzzle, and scratched her head with reiterated gestures full of prettiness. "All right, make a little toilet," the Frenchman said to himself, beginning to recover his gaiety with his courage; "we'll say good morning to each other presently," and he seized the small, short dagger which he had taken from the Mangrabins. At this moment the panther turned her head toward the man and looked at him fixedly without moving.  The rigidity of her metallic eyes and their insupportable luster made him shudder, especially when the animal walked toward him. But he looked at her caressingly, staring into her eyes in order to magnetize her, and let her come quite close to him; then with a movement both gentle and amorous, as though he were caressing the most beautiful of women, he passed his hand over her whole body, from the head to the tail, scratching the flexible vertebrae which divided the panther's yellow back. The animal waved her tail voluptuously, and her eyes grew gentle; and when for the third time the Frenchman accomplished this interesting flattery, she gave forth one of those purrings by which our cats express their pleasure; but this murmur issued from a throat so powerful and so deep that it resounded through the cave like the last vibrations of an organ in a church. The man, understanding the importance of his caresses, redoubled them in such a way as to surprise and stupefy his imperious courtesan. When he felt sure of having extinguished the ferocity of his capricious companion, whose hunger had so fortunately been satisfied the day before, he got up to go out of the cave; the panther let him go out, but when he had reached the summit of the hill she sprang with the lightness of a sparrow hopping from twig to twig, and rubbed herself against his legs, putting up her back after the manner of all the race of cats. Then regarding her guest with eyes whose glare had softened a little, she gave vent to that wild cry which naturalists compare to the grating of a saw.  "She is exacting," said the Frenchman, smilingly.  He was bold enough to play with her ears; he caressed her belly and scratched her head as hard as he could.  When he saw that he was successful, he tickled her skull with the point of his dagger, watching for the right moment to kill her, but the hardness of her bones made him tremble for his success.  The sultana of the desert showed herself gracious to her slave; she lifted her head, stretched out her and manifested her delight by - the tranquility of her attitude. It suddenly occurred to the soldier that to kill this savage princess with one blow he must poignard her in the throat.  He raised the blade, when the panther, satisfied no doubt, laid herself gracefully at his feet, and cast up at him glances in which, in spite of their natural fierceness, was mingled confusedly a kind of good will. The poor Provenal ate his dates, leaning against one of the palm trees, and casting his eyes alternately on the desert in quest of some liberator and on his terrible companion to watch her uncertain clemency.  The panther looked at the place where the date stones fell, and every time that he threw one down her eyes expressed an incredible mistrust.  She examined the man with an almost commercial prudence. However, this examination was favorable to him, for when he had finished his meager meal she licked his boots with her powerful rough tongue, brushing off with marvelous skill the dust gathered in the creases.  "Ah, but when she's really hungry!" thought the Frenchman. In spite of the shudder this thought caused him, the soldier began to measure curiously the proportions of the panther, certainly one of the most splendid specimens of its race. She was three feet high and four feet long without counting her tail; this powerful weapon, rounded like a cudgel, was nearly three feet long. The head, large as that of a lioness, was distinguished by a rare expression of refinement. The cold cruelty of a tiger was dominant, it was true, but there was also a vague resemblance to the face of a sensual woman. Indeed, the face of this solitary queen had something of the gaiety of a drunken Nero: she had satiated herself with blood, and she wanted to play.  The soldier tried if he might walk up and down, and the panther left him free, contenting herself with following him with her eyes, less like a faithful dog than a big Angora cat, observing everything and every movement of her master.  When he looked around, he saw, by the spring, the remains of his horse; the panther had dragged the carcass all that way; about two thirds of it had been devoured already. The sight reassured him.  It was easy to explain the panther's absence, and the respect she had had for him while he slept. The first piece of good luck emboldened him to tempt the future, and he conceived the wild hope of continuing on good terms with the panther during the entire day, neglecting no means of taming her, and remaining her good graces.  He returned to her, and had the unspeakable joy of seeing her wag her tail with an almost imperceptible movement at his approach. He sat down then, without fear, by her side, and they began to play together; he took her paws and muzzle, pulled her ears, rolled her over on her back, stroked her warm, delicate flanks. She let him do what ever he liked, and when he began to stroke the hair on her feet she drew her claws in carefully.  The man, keeping the dagger in one hand, thought to plunge it into the belly of the too-confiding panther, but he was afraid that he would be immediately strangled in her last conclusive struggle; besides, he felt in his heart a sort of remorse which bid him respect a creature that had done him no harm. He seemed to have found a friend, in a boundless desert; half unconsciously he thought of his first sweetheart, whom he had nicknamed "Mignonne" by way of contrast, because she was so atrociously jealous that all the time of their love he was in fear of the knife with which she had always threatened him.  This memory of his early days suggested to him the idea of making the young panther answer to this name, now that he began to admire with less terror her swiftness, suppleness, and softness. Toward the end of the day he had familiarized himself with his perilous position; he now almost liked the painfulness of it. At last his companion had got into the habit of looking up at him whenever he cried in a falsetto voice, "Mignonne."  At the setting of the sun Mignonne gave, several times running, a profound melancholy cry. "She's been well brought up," said the lighthearted soldier; "she says her prayers." But this mental joke only occurred to him when he noticed what a pacific attitude his companion remained in. "Come, ma petite blonde, I'll let you go to bed first," he said to her, counting on the activity of his own legs to run away as quickly as possible, directly she was asleep, and seek another shelter for the night.  The soldier waited with impatience the hour of his flight, and when it had arrived he walked vigorously in the direction of the Nile; but hardly had he made a quarter of a league in the sand when he heard the panther bounding after him, crying with that sawlike cry more dreadful even than the sound of her leaping.  "Ah!" he said, "then she's taken a fancy to me, she has never met anyone before, and it is really quite flattering to have her first love."  That instant the man fell into one, of those movable quicksands so terrible to travelers and from which it is impossible to save oneself. Feeling himself caught, he gave a shriek of alarm; the panther seized him with her teeth by the collar, and, springing vigorously backward, drew him as if by magic out of the whirling sand.  "Ah, Mignonne!" cried the soldier, caressing her enthusiastically; "we're bound together for life and death but no jokes, mind!" and he retraced his steps.  From that time the desert seemed inhabited. It contained a being to whom the man could talk, and whose ferocity was rendered gentle by him, though he could not explain to himself the reason for their strange friendship. Great as was the soldier's desire to stay upon guard, he slept.  On awakening he could not find Mignonne; he mounted the hill, and in the distance saw her springing toward him after the habit of these animals, who cannot run on account of the extreme flexibility of the vertebral column. Mignonne arrived, her jaws covered with blood; she received the wonted caress of her companion, showing with much purring how happy it made her. Her eyes, full of languor, turned still more gently than the day before toward the Provenal who talked to her as one would to a tame animal.  "Ah! Mademoiselle, you are a nice girl, aren't you? Just look at that! So we like to be made much of, don't we? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? So you have been eating some Arab or other, have you? That doesn't matter. They're animals just the same as you are; but don't you take to eating Frenchmen, or I shan't like you any longer."  She played like a dog with its master, letting herself be rolled over, knocked about, and stroked, alternately; sometimes she herself would provoke the soldier, putting up her paw with a soliciting gesture.  Some days passed in this manner. This companionship permitted the Provenal to appreciate the sublime beauty of the desert; now that he had a living thing to think about, alternations of fear and quiet, and plenty to eat, his mind became filled with contrast and his life began to be diversified.  Solitude revealed to him all her secrets, and enveloped him in her delights. He discovered in the rising and setting of the sun sights unknown to the world. He knew what it was to tremble when he heard over his head the hiss of a bird's wing, so rarely did they pass, or when he saw the clouds, changing and many-colored travelers, melt one into another. He studied in the night time the effect of the moon upon the ocean of sand, where the simoom made waves swift of movement and rapid in their change. He lived the life of the Eastern day, marveling at its wonderful pomp; then, after having reveled in the sight of a hurricane over the plain where the whirling sands made red, dry mists and death-bearing clouds, he would welcome the night with joy, for then fell the healthful freshness of the stars, and he listened to imaginary music in the skies. Then solitude taught him to unroll the treasures of dreams. He passed whole hours in remembering mere nothings, and comparing his present life with his past.  At last he grew passionately fond of the panther; for some sort of affection was a necessity.  Whether it was that his will powerfully projected had modified the character of his companion, or whether, because she found abundant food in her predatory excursions in the desert, she respected the man's life, he began to fear for it no longer, seeing her so well tamed.  He devoted the greater part of his time to sleep, but he was obliged to watch like a spider knits web that the moment of his deliverance might not escape him, if anyone should pass the line marked by the horizon. He had sacrificed his shirt to make a flag with, which he hung at the top of a palm tree, whose foliage he had torn off. Taught by necessity, he found the means of keeping it spread out, by fastening it with little sticks; for the wind might not be blowing at the moment when the passing traveler was looking through the desert.  It was during the long hours, when he had abandoned hope, that he amused himself with the panther. He had come to learn the different inflections of her voice, the expressions of her eyes; he had studied the capricious patterns of all the rosettes which marked the gold of her robe. Mignonne was not even angry when he took hold of the tuft at the end of her tail to count her rings, those graceful ornaments which glittered in the sun like jewelry. It gave him pleasure to contemplate the supple, fine outlines of her form, the whiteness of her belly, the graceful pose of her head. But it was especially when she was playing that he felt most pleasure in looking at her; the agility and youthful lightness of her movements were a continual surprise to him; he wondered at the supple way in which she jumped and climbed, washed herself and arranged her fur, crouched down and prepared to spring. However rapid her spring might be, however slippery the stone she was on, she would always stop short at the word "Mignonne."  One day, in a bright midday sun, an enormous bird coursed through the air. The man left his panther to look at this new guest; but after waiting a moment the deserted sultana growled deeply.  "My goodness! I do believe she's jealous," he cried, seeing her eyes become hard again; "the soul of Virginie has passed into her body; that's certain."  The eagle disappeared into the air, while the soldier admired the curved contour of the panther.  But there was such youth and grace in her form! she was beautiful as a woman! the blond fur of her robe mingled well with the delicate tints of faint white which marked her flanks.  The profuse light cast down by the sun made this living gold, these russet markings, to burn in a way to give them an indefinable attraction.  The man and the panther looked at one another with a look full of meaning; the coquette quivered when she felt her friend stroke her head; her eyes flashed like lightning-- then she shut them tightly.  "She has a soul," he said, looking at the stillness of this queen of the sands, golden like them, white like them, solitary and burning like them.  "Well," she said, "I have read your plea in favor of beasts; but how did two so well adapted to understand each other end?"  "Ah, well! you see, they ended as all great passions do end--by a misunderstanding. For some reason one suspects the other of treason; they don't come to an explanation through pride, and quarrel and part from sheer obstinacy."  "Yet sometimes at the best moments a single word or a look is enough--but anyhow go on with your story."  "It's horribly difficult, but you will understand, after what the old villain told me over his champagne.  "He said--`I don't know if I hurt her, but she turned round, as if enraged, and with her sharp teeth caught hold of my leg--gently, I daresay; but I, thinking she would devour me, plunged my dagger into her throat. She rolled over, giving a cry that froze my heart; and I saw her dying, still looking at me without anger. I would have given all the world--my cross even, which I lied not then--to have brought her to life again. It was as though I had murdered a real person; and the soldiers who had seen my flag, and were come to my assistance, found me in tears.'  "`Well sir,' he said, after a moment of silence, `since then I have been in war in Germany, in Spain, in Russia, in France; I've certainly carried my carcass about a good deal, but never have I seen anything like the desert. Ah! yes, it is very beautiful!'  " 'What did you feel there?' I asked him.  "'Oh! that can't be described, young man. Besides, I am not always regretting my palm trees and my panther. I should have to be very melancholy for that. In the desert, you see, there is everything and nothing.'  Yes, but explain----'  "'Well,' he said, with an impatient gesture, 'it is God without mankind.'"
One evening I went with the huntsman Yermolai "stand-shooting." . . . But perhaps all my readers may not know what "stand-shooting" is. I will tell you.  A quarter of an hour before sunset in springtime you go out into the woods with your gun, but without your dog. You seek out a spot for yourself on the outskirts of the forest, take a look round, examine your caps, and glance at your companion. A quarter of an hour passes; the sun has set, but it is still light in the forest; the sky is clear and transparent; the birds are chattering and twittering; the young grass shines with the brilliance of emerald. . . . You wait. Gradually the recesses of the forest grow dark; the blood-red glow of the evening sky creeps slowly on to the roots and the trunks. of the trees, and keeps rising higher and higher, passes from the lower, still almost leafless branches, to the motionless, slumbering tree-tops. . . . And now even the topmost branches are darkened; the purple sky fades to dark-blue. The forest fragrance grows stronger; there is a scent of warmth and damp earth; the fluttering breeze dies away at your side. The birds go to sleep—not all at once—but after their kinds; first the finches are hushed, a few minutes later the warblers, and after them the yellow buntings. In the forest it grows darker and darker. The trees melt together into great masses of blackness; in the dark-blue sky the first stars come timidly out. All the birds are asleep. Only the redstarts and the nuthatches are still chirping drowsily. . . . And now they, too, are still. The last echoing call of the peewit rings over our heads; the oriole's melancholy cry sounds somewhere in the distance; then the nightingale's first note. Your heart is weary with suspense, when suddenly—but only hunters can understand me—suddenly in the deep hush there is a peculiar croaking and whirring sound, the measured sweep of swift wings is heard, and the snipe, gracefully bending its long beak, sails smoothly from behind a dark bush to meet your shot.  That is the meaning of "stand-shooting."  And so I had gone out stand-shooting with Yermolai. But excuse me, reader: I must first introduce you to Yermolai.  Picture to yourself a tall gaunt man of forty-five, with a long thin nose, a narrow forehead, little grey eyes, a bristling head of hair, and thick sarcastic lips. This man wore, winter and summer alike, a yellow nankin coat of foreign cut, but with a sash round the waist; he wore blue pantaloons and a cap of astrakhan, presented to him in a merry hour by a spendthrift landowner. Two bags were fastened on to his sash, one in front, skilfully tied into two halves, for powder and for shot; the other behind for game; wadding Yermolai used to produce out of his peculiar, seemingly inexhaustible cap. With the money he gained by the game he sold, he might easily have bought himself a cartridge-box and powder-flask; but he never once even contemplated such a purchase, and continued to load his gun after his old fashion, exciting the admiration of all beholders by the skill with which he avoided the risks of spilling or mixing his powder and shot. His gun was a single-barrelled flint-lock, endowed, moreover, with a villainous habit of "kicking." It was due to this that Yermolai's right cheek was permanently swollen to a larger size than the left. How he ever succeeded in hitting anything with this gun, it would take a shrewd man to discover—but he did. He had, too, a setter-dog, by name Valetka, a most extraordinary creature. Yermolai never fed him. "Me feed a dog!" he reasoned; "why, a dog's a clever beast; he finds a living for himself." And certainly, though Valetka's extreme thinness was a shock even to an indifferent observer, he still lived and had a long life; and in spite of his pitiable position he was not even once lost, and never showed an inclination to desert his master. Once indeed, in his youth, he had absented himself for two days, on courting bent, but this folly was soon over with him. Valetka's most noticeable peculiarity was his impenetrable indifference to everything in the world. . . . If it were not a dog I was speaking of, I should have called him "disillusioned." He usually sat with his cropped tail curled up under him, scowling and twitching at times, and he never smiled. (It is well known that dogs can smile, and smile very sweetly.) He was exceedingly ugly; and the idle house-serfs never lost an opportunity of jeering cruelly at his appearance; but all these jeers, and even blows, Valetka bore with astonishing indifference. He was a source of special delight to the cooks, who would all leave their work at once and give him chase with shouts and abuse, whenever, through a weakness not confined to dogs, he thrust his hungry nose through the half-open door of the kitchen, tempting with its warmth and appetizing smells. He distinguished himself by untiring energy in the chase, and had a good scent; but if he chanced to overtake a slightly wounded hare, he devoured it with relish to the last bone, somewhere in the cool shade under the green bushes, at a respectful distance from Yermolai, who was abusing him in every known and unknown dialect.  Yermolai belonged to one of my neighbours, a landlord of the old style. Landlords of the old style don't care for game, and prefer the domestic fowl. Only on extraordinary occasions, such as birthdays, namedays, and elections, the cooks of the old-fashioned landlords set to work to prepare some long-beaked birds, and, falling into the state of frenzy peculiar to Russians when they don't quite know what to do, they concoct such marvellous sauces for them that the guests examine the proffered dishes curiously and attentively, but rarely make up their minds to try them. Yermolai was under orders to provide his master's kitchen with two brace of grouse and partridges once a month. But he might live where and how he pleased. They had given him up as a man of no use for work of any kind—"bone lazy," they called him. Powder and shot, of course, they did not provide him, following precisely the same principle in virtue of which he did not feed his dog. Yermolai was a very strange kind of man; heedless as a bird, rather fond of talking, awkward and vacant-looking; he was excessively fond of drink, and never could sit still long; in walking he shambled along, and rolled from side to side; and yet he got over fifty miles in the day with his rolling, shambling gait. He exposed himself to the most varied adventures: spent the night in the marshes, in trees, on roofs, or under bridges; more than once he had got shut up in lofts, cellars, or barns; he sometimes lost his gun, his dog, his most indispensable garments; got long and severe thrashings; but he always returned home after a little while, in his clothes, and with his gun and his dog. One could not call him a cheerful man, though one almost always found him in an even frame of mind; he was looked on generally as an eccentric. Yermolai liked a little chat with a good companion, especially over a glass, but he would not stop long; he would get up and go. "But where the devil are you going? It's dark out of doors." "To Chaplino." "But what's taking you to Chaplino, ten miles away?" "I am going to stay the night at Sofron's there." "But stay the night here." "No, I can't." And Yermolai, with his Valetka, would go off into the dark night, through woods and watercourses, and the peasant Sofron very likely did not let him into his place, and even, I am afraid, gave him a blow to teach him "not to disturb honest folks." But none could compare with Yermolai in skill in deep-water fishing in springtime, in catching crayfish with his hands, in tracking game by scent, in snaring quails, in training hawks, in capturing the nightingales who had the greatest variety of notes. . . . One thing he could not do, train a dog; he had not patience enough. He had a wife, too. He went to see her once a week. She lived in a wretched, tumble-down little hut, and led a hand-to-mouth existence, never knowing overnight whether she would have food to eat on the morrow; and in every way her lot was a pitiful one. Yermolai, who seemed such a careless and easy-going fellow, treated his wife with cruel harshness; in his own house he assumed a stern and menacing manner; and his poor wife did everything she could to please him, trembled when he looked at her, and spent her last farthing to buy him vodka; and when he stretched himself majestically on the stove and fell into an heroic sleep, she obsequiously covered him with her sheepskin. I happened myself more than once to catch an involuntary look in him of a kind of savage ferocity; I did not like the expression of his face when he finished off a wounded bird with his teeth. But Yermolai never remained more than a day at home, and away from home he was once more the same "Yermolka," (i.e., the shooting cap), as he was called for a hundred miles round, and as he sometimes called himself. The lowest house-serf was conscious of being superior to this vagabond—and perhaps this was precisely why they treated him with friendliness; the peasants at first amused themselves by chasing him and driving him like a hare over the open country, but afterwards they left him in God's hands, and when once they recognized him as "queer," they no longer tormented him, and even gave him bread and entered into talk with him. . . . This was the man I took as my huntsman, and with him I went stand-shooting to a great birch wood on the banks of the Ista.  Many Russian rivers, like the Volga, have one bank rugged and precipitous, the other bounded by level meadows; and so it is with the Ista. This small river winds extremely capriciously, coils like a snake, and does not keep a straight course for half a mile together; in some places, from the top of a sharp declivity, one can see the river for ten miles, with its dykes, its pools and mills, and the gardens on its banks, shut in with willows and thick flower-gardens. There are fish in the Ista in endless numbers, especially roaches (the peasants take them in hot weather from under the bushes with their hands); little sandpipers flutter whistling along the stony banks, which are streaked with cold clear streams; wild ducks dive in the middle of the pools, and look round warily; in the coves under the overhanging cliffs herons stand out in the shade. . . . We stood in ambush nearly an hour, killed two brace of wood snipe, and, as we wanted to try our luck again at sunrise (stand-shooting can be done as well in the early morning), we resolved to spend the night at the nearest mill. We came out of the wood and went down the slope. The dark-blue waters of the river ran below; the air was thick with the mists of night. We knocked at the gate. The dogs began barking in the yard.  "Who is there?" asked a hoarse and sleepy voice.  "We are hunters; let us stay the night." There was no reply. "We will pay."  "I will go and tell the master—Sh! curse the dogs! Go to the devil with you!"  We listened as the workman went into the cottage; he soon came back to the gate. "No," he said; "the master tells me not to let you in."  "Why not?"  "He is afraid; you are hunters, you might set the mill on fire; you've firearms with you, to be sure."  "But what nonsense!"  "We had our mill on fire like that last year; some fish-dealers stayed the night, and they managed to set it on fire somehow."  "But, my good friend, we can't sleep in the open air!"  "That's your business." He went away, his boots clacking as he walked.  Yermolai promised him various unpleasant things in the future. "Let us go to the village," he brought out at last, with a sigh. But it was two miles to the village:  "Let us stay the night here," I said, "in the open air—the night is warm; the miller will let us have some straw if we pay for it."  Yermolai agreed without discussion. We began again to knock.  "Well, what do you want?" the workman's voice was heard again; "I've told you we can't."  We explained to him what we wanted. He went to consult the master of the house, and returned with him. The little side gate creaked. The miller appeared, a tall, fat-faced man with a bull neck, round-bellied and corpulent. He agreed to my proposal. A hundred paces from the mill there was a little out-building open to the air on all sides. They carried straw and hay there for us; the workman set a samovar down on the grass near the river, and, squatting on his heels, began to blow vigorously into its pipe. The embers glowed, and threw a bright light on his young face. The miller ran to wake his wife, and suggested at last that I myself should sleep in the cottage; but I preferred to remain in the open air. The miller's wife brought us milk, eggs, potatoes and bread. Soon the samovar boiled, and we began drinking tea. A mist had risen from the river; there was no wind; from all round came the cry of the corn-crake, and faint sounds from the mill-wheels of drops that dripped from the paddles and of water gurgling through the bars of the lock. We built a small fire on the ground. While Yermolai was baking the potatoes in the embers, I had time to fall into a doze. I was waked by a discreetly subdued whispering near me. I lifted my head; before the fire, on a tub turned upside down, the miller's wife sat talking to my huntsman. By her dress, her movements, and her manner of speaking, I had already recognized that she had been in domestic service, and was neither peasant nor city-bred; but now for the first time I got a clear view of her features. She looked about thirty; her thin, pale face still showed the traces of remarkable beauty; what particularly charmed me was her eyes, large and mournful in expression. She was leaning her elbows on her knees, and had her face in her hands. Yermolai was sitting with his back to me and thrusting sticks into the fire.  "They've the cattle-plague again at Zheltukhina," the miller's wife was saying; "father Ivan's two cows are dead—Lord have mercy on them!"  "And how are your pigs doing?" asked Yermolai, after a brief pause.  "They're alive."  "You ought to make me a present of a sucking pig."  The miller's wife was silent for a while, then she sighed.  "Who is it you're with?" she asked.  "A gentleman from Kostomarovo."  Yermolai threw a few pine twigs on the fire; they all caught fire at once, and a thick white smoke came puffing into his face.  "Why didn't your husband let us into the cottage?"  "He's afraid."  "Afraid! the fat old tub! Arina Timofeyevna, my darling, bring me a little glass of spirits."  The miller's wife rose and vanished into the darkness. Yermolai began to sing in an undertone:  When I went to see my sweetheart, I wore out all my boots. . .    Arina returned with a small flask and a glass. Yermolai got up, crossed himself, and drank it off at a draught. "Good!" was his comment.  The miller's wife sat down again on the tub.  "Well, Arina Timofeyevna, are you still ill?"  "Yes."  "What is it?"  "My cough troubles me at night."  "The gentleman's asleep, it seems," observed Yermolai after a short silence. "Don't go to a doctor, Arina; it will be worse if you do."  "Well, I am not going."  "But come and pay me a visit."  Arina hung down her head dejectedly.  "I will drive my wife out for the occasion," continued Yermolai. "Upon my word, I will."  "You had better wake the gentleman, Yermolai Petrovich; you see, the potatoes are done."  "Oh, let him snore," observed my faithful servant indifferently; "he's tired with walking, so he sleeps sound."  I turned over in the hay. Yermolai got up and came to me. "The potatoes are ready; will you come and eat them?"  I came out of the out-building; the miller's wife got up from the tub and was going away. I addressed her:  "Have you kept this mill long?"  "It's two years since I came on Trinity Day."  "And where does your husband come from?"  Arina had not caught my question.  "Where's your husband from?" repeated Yermolai, raising his voice.  "From Belev. He's a Belev townsman."  "And are you too from Belev?"  "No, I'm a serf; I was a serf."  "Whose?"  "Zvyerkov was my master. Now I am free."  "What Zvyerkov?"  "Alexander Silitch."  "Weren't you his wife's lady's maid?"  "How did you know? Yes."  I looked at Arina with redoubled curiosity and sympathy.  "I know your master," I continued.  "Do you?" she replied in a low voice, and her head drooped.  I must tell the reader why I looked with such sympathy at Arina. During my stay at Petersburg I had become by chance acquainted with Mr. Zvyerkov. He had a rather influential position, and was reputed a man of sense and education. He had a wife, fat, sentimental, lachrymose and spiteful—an ordinary and disagreeable creature; he had, too, a son, the very type of the young swell of today, pampered and stupid. The exterior of Mr. Zvyerkov himself did not prepossess one in his favour; his little mouse-like eyes peeped slyly out of a broad, almost square face; he had a large, sharp nose, with distended nostrils; his close-cropped grey hair stood up like a brush above his furrowed brow; his thin lips were forever twitching and smiling mawkishly. Mr. Zvyerkov's favourite position was standing with his short legs wide apart and his podgy hands in his trouser pockets. Once I happened somehow to be driving alone with Mr. Zvyerkov in a coach out of town. We fell into conversation. As a man of experience and of judgement, Mr. Zvyerkov began to try to set me in "the path of truth."  "Allow me to observe to you," he piped at last: "all you young people criticize and form judgements on everything at random; you have little knowledge of your own country; Russia, young gentlemen, is an unknown land to you; that's where it is!. . . You are forever reading German. For instance, now you say this and that and the other about anything; for instance, about the house serfs. . . . Very fine; I don't dispute it's all very fine; but you don't know them; you don't know the kind of people they are." (Mr. Zvyerkov blew his nose loudly and took a pinch of snuff.) "Allow me to tell you as an illustration one little anecdote; it may perhaps interest you." (Mr. Zverkov cleared his throat.) "You know, doubtless, what my wife is; it would be difficult, I should imagine, to find a more kind-hearted woman, you will agree. For her waiting-maids, existence is simply a perfect paradise, and no mistake about it. . . . But my wife has made it a rule never to keep married serving-maids. Certainly it would not do; children come—and one thing and the other—and how is a lady's maid to look after her mistress as she ought, to fit in with her ways; she is no longer able to do it; her mind is on other things. One must look at things through human nature. Well, we were driving once through our village, it must be—let me be correct—yes, fifteen years ago. We saw, at the bailiff's, a young girl, his daughter, very pretty indeed; something even—you know—something of the good servant in her manners. And my wife said to me: 'Koko'—you understand, of course, that is her pet name for me—'let us take this girl to Petersburg; I like her, Koko. . . .' I said, 'Let us take her, by all means.' The bailiff, of course, was at our feet; he could not have expected such good fortune, you can imagine. . . . Well, the girl, of course, cried violently. Of course, it was hard for her at first; the parental home . . . and that sort of thing . . . there was nothing surprising in that. However, she soon got used to us: at first we put her in the maidservants' room; they trained her, of course. And what do you think? The girl made wonderful progress; my wife became simply devoted to her, promoted her at last above the rest to wait on herself . . . observe. . . . And one must do her the justice to say, my wife had never such a maid, absolutely never; attentive, modest, and obedient—simply all that could be desired. My wife was very good to her; she even spoilt her, I must confess; she dressed her well, fed her from our own table, gave her tea to drink, and so on, as you can imagine! So she waited on my wife like this for ten years. Suddenly, one fine morning, picture to yourself, Arina—her name was Arina—rushes unannounced into my study and flops down at my feet. That's a thing, I tell you plainly, I can't endure. No human being ought ever to lose sight of his personal dignity. Am I not right? 'What do you want?' 'Your honour, Alexander Silitch, I beseech a favour of you.' 'What favour?' 'Let me be married.' I must confess I was taken aback. 'But you know, you fool, your mistress has no other lady's maid?' 'I will wait on Mistress as before.' 'Nonsense! Nonsense! Your mistress can't endure married serving-maids.' 'Malanya could take my place.' 'Don't argue with me.' 'I obey your will.' I must confess it was quite a shock. I assure you, I am like that; nothing wounds me so—nothing, I venture to say, wounds me so deeply as ingratitude. I need not tell you—you know what my wife is: an angel upon earth, goodness inexhaustible. One would fancy even the worst of men would be ashamed to hurt her. Well, I sent Arina away. I thought, perhaps, she would come to her senses; I was unwilling, do you know, to believe in wicked, black ingratitude in anyone. What do you think? Within six months she thought fit to come to me again with the same request. And here I must confess I turned her out in a temper and threatened to tell my wife about it. I felt revolted. But imagine my amazement when, some time later, my wife comes to me in tears, so agitated that I felt positively alarmed. 'What has happened?' 'Arina. . . . You understand. . . . I am ashamed to tell it.' 'Impossible! Who is the man?' 'Petrushka, the footman.' My indignation broke out then. I am like that. I don't like half-measures! Petrushka—well, he wasn't to blame. We might flog him, but in my opinion he was not to blame. Arina. . . . Well, well, well! What more's to be said? I gave orders, of course, that her hair should be cut off, she should be dressed in sackcloth, and sent back to the village. My wife was deprived of an excellent lady's maid; but there was no help for it: immorality cannot be tolerated in a household in any case. Better to cut off the infected member at once. There, there! now you can judge the thing for yourself—you know that my wife is . . . yes, yes, yes! indeed! . . . an angel! She had grown attached to Arina, and Arina knew it, and had the face to. . . . Eh? no, tell me . . . eh? And what's the use of talking about it. Anyway, there was no help for it. I, indeed—I, in particular, felt hurt, felt wounded for a long time by the ingratitude of this girl. Whatever you say—it's no good to look for feeling, for heart, in these people! You may feed the wolf as you will; he has always a hankering for the woods. It was a good lesson! But I only wanted to give you an example. . . ."  And Mr. Zvyerkov, without finishing his sentence, turned away his head, and, wrapping himself more closely into his cloak, manfully repressed his involuntary emotion. The reader now probably understands why I looked with sympathetic interest at Arina.  "Have you long been married to the miller?" I asked her at last.  "Two years."  "How was it? Did your master allow it?"  "They bought my freedom."  "Who?"  "Savely Alexeyevich."  "Who is that?"  "My husband." (Yermolai smiled to himself.) "Has my master perhaps spoken to you of me?" added Arina, after a brief silence.  I did not know what reply to make to her question.  "Arina!" cried the miller from a distance. She got up and walked away.  "Is her husband a good fellow?" I asked Yermolai.  "So-so."  "Have they any children?"  "There was one, but it died."  "How was it? Did the miller take a liking to her? Did he give much to buy her freedom?"  "I don't know. She can read and write; in their business it's of use. I suppose he liked her."  "And have you known her long?"  "Yes. I used to go to her master's. Their house isn't far from here."  "And do you know the footman Petrushka?"  "You mean Pyotr Vasilyevich? Of course, I knew him."  "Where is he now?"  "He was sent for a soldier."  We were silent for a while.  "She doesn't seem well?" I asked Yermolai at last.  "I should think not! Tomorrow, I say, we shall have good sport. A little sleep now would do us no harm."  A flock of wild ducks swept whizzing over our heads, and we heard them drop down into the river not far from us. It was now quite dark, and it began to be cold; in the thicket sounded the melodious notes of a nightingale. We buried ourselves in the hay and fell asleep.  
Between eight and nine o’clock in the morning. A dark leaden-colored mass is creeping over the sky towards the sun. Red zigzags of lightning gleam here and there across it. There is a sound of far-away rumbling. A warm wind frolics over the grass, bends the trees, and stirs up the dust. In a minute there will be a spurt of May rain and a real storm will begin. Fyokla, a little beggar-girl of six, is running through the village, looking for Terenty the cobbler. The white-haired, barefoot child is pale. Her eyes are wide-open, her lips are trembling. “Uncle, where is Terenty?” she asks every one she meets. No one answers. They are all preoccupied with the approaching storm and take refuge in their huts. At last she meets Silanty Silitch, the sacristan, Terenty’s bosom friend. He is coming along, staggering from the wind. “Uncle, where is Terenty?” “At the kitchen-gardens,” answers Silanty. The beggar-girl runs behind the huts to the kitchen-gardens and there finds Terenty; the tall old man with a thin, pock-marked face, very long legs, and bare feet, dressed in a woman’s tattered jacket, is standing near the vegetable plots, looking with drowsy, drunken eyes at the dark storm-cloud. On his long crane-like legs he sways in the wind like a starling-cote. “Uncle Terenty!” the white-headed beggar-girl addresses him. “Uncle, darling!” Terenty bends down to Fyokla, and his grim, drunken face is overspread with a smile, such as come into people’s faces when they look at something little, foolish, and absurd, but warmly loved. “Ah! servant of God, Fyokla,” he says, lisping tenderly, “where have you come from?” “Uncle Terenty,” says Fyokla, with a sob, tugging at the lapel of the cobbler’s coat. “Brother Danilka has had an accident! Come along!” “What sort of accident? Ough, what thunder! Holy, holy, holy. What sort of accident?” “In the count’s copse Danilka stuck his hand into a hole in a tree, and he can’t get it out. Come along, uncle, do be kind and pull his hand out!” “How was it he put his hand in? What for?” “He wanted to get a cuckoo’s egg out of the hole for me.” “The day has hardly begun and already you are in trouble.” Terenty shook his head and spat deliberately. “Well, what am I to do with you now? I must come. I must, may the wolf gobble you up, you naughty children! Come, little orphan!” Terenty comes out of the kitchen-garden and, lifting high his long legs, begins striding down the village street. He walks quickly without stopping or looking from side to side, as though he were shoved from behind or afraid of pursuit. Fyokla can hardly keep up with him. They come out of the village and turn along the dusty road towards the count’s copse that lies dark blue in the distance. It is about a mile and a half away. The clouds have by now covered the sun, and soon afterwards there is not a speck of blue left in the sky. It grows dark. “Holy, holy, holy” whispers Fyokla, hurrying after Terenty. The first rain-drops, big and heavy, lie, dark dots on the dusty road. A big drop falls on Fyokla’s cheek and glides like a tear down her chin. “The rain has begun,” mutters the cobbler, kicking up the dust with his bare, bony feet. “That’s fine, Fyokla, old girl. The grass and the trees are fed by the rain, as we are by bread. And as for the thunder, don’t you be frightened, little orphan. Why should it kill a little thing like you?” As soon as the rain begins, the wind drops. The only sound is the patter of rain dropping like fine shot on the young rye and the parched road. “We shall get soaked, Fyokla,” mutters Terenty. “There won’t be a dry spot left on us. Ho-ho, my girl! It’s run down my neck! But don’t be frightened, silly. The grass will be dry again, the earth will be dry again, and we shall be dry again. There is the same sun for us all.” A flash of lightning, some fourteen feet long, gleams above their head. There is a loud peal of thunder, and it seems to Fyokla that something big, heavy, and round is rolling over the sky and tearing it open, exactly over her head. “Holy, holy, holy” says Terenty, crossing himself. “Don’t be afraid, little orphan! It is not from spite that it thunders.” Terenty’s and Fyokla’s feet are covered with lumps of heavy, wet clay. It is slippery and difficult to walk, but Terenty strides on more and more rapidly. The weak little beggar-girl is breathless and ready to drop. But at last they go into the count’s copse. The washed trees, stirred by a gust of wind, drop a perfect waterfall upon them. Terenty stumbles over stumps and begins to slacken his pace. “Whereabouts is Danilka?” he asks. “Lead me to him.” Fyokla leads him into a thicket, and, after going a quarter of a mile, points to Danilka. Her brother, a little fellow of eight, with hair as red as ochre and a pale sickly face, stands leaning against a tree, and, with his head on one side, looking sideways at the sky. In one hand he holds his shabby old cap, the other is hidden in an old lime tree. The boy is gazing at the stormy sky, and apparently not thinking of his trouble. Hearing footsteps and seeing the cobbler he gives sickly smile and says: “A terrible lot of thunder, Terenty. I’ve never heard so much thunder in all my life.” “And where is your hand?” “In the hole. Pull it out, please, Terenty!” The wood had broken at the edge of the hole and jammed Danilka’s hand: he could push it farther in, but could not pull it out. Terenty snaps off the broken piece, and the boy’s hand, red and crushed, is released. “It’s terrible how it’s thundering,” the boy says again, rubbing his hand. “What makes it thunder, Terenty?” “One cloud runs against the other,” answers the cobbler. The party come out of the copse, and walk along the edge of it towards the darkened road. The thunder gradually abates, and its rumbling is heard far away beyond the village. “The ducks flew by here the other day, Terenty,” says Danilka, still rubbing his hand. “They must be nesting in the Gniliya Zaimishtcha marshes. Fyokla, would you like me to show you a nightingale’s nest?” “Don’t touch it, you might disturb them,” says Terenty, wringing the water out of his cap. “The nightingale is a singing-bird, without sin. He has had a voice given him in his throat, to praise God and gladden the heart of man. It’s a sin to disturb him.” “What about the sparrow?” “The sparrow doesn’t matter, he’s a bad, spiteful bird. He is like a pickpocket in his ways. He doesn’t like man to be happy. When Christ was crucified it was the sparrow brought nails to the Jews, and called ‘alive! alive!’ “ A bright patch of blue appears in the sky. “Look!” says Terenty. “An ant-heap burst open by the rain! They’ve been flooded, the rogues!” They bend over the ant-heap. The downpour has damaged it; the insects are scurrying to and fro in the mud, agitated, and busily trying to carry away their drowned companions. “You needn’t be in such a taking, you won’t die of it!” says Terenty, grinning. “As soon as the sun warms you, you’ll come to your senses again. It’s a lesson to you, you stupids. You won’t settle on low ground another time.” They go on. “And here are some bees,” cries Danilka, pointing to the branch of a young oak tree. The drenched and chilled bees are huddled together on the branch. There are so many of them that neither bark nor leaf can be seen. Many of them are settled on one another. “That’s a swarm of bees,” Terenty informs them. “They were flying looking for a home, and when the rain came down upon them they settled. If a swarm is flying, you need only sprinkle water on them to make them settle. Now if, say, you wanted to take the swarm, you would bend the branch with them into a sack and shake it, and they all fall in.” Little Fyokla suddenly frowns and rubs her neck vigorously. Her brother looks at her neck, and sees a big swelling on it. “Hey-hey!” laughs the cobbler. “Do you know where you got that from, Fyokla, old girl? There are Spanish flies on some tree in the wood. The rain has trickled off them, and a drop has fallen on your neck. That’s what has made the swelling.” The sun appears from behind the clouds and floods the wood, the fields, and the three friends with its warm light. The dark menacing cloud has gone far away and taken the storm with it. The air is warm and fragrant. There is a scent of bird-cherry, meadowsweet, and lilies-of-the-valley. “That herb is given when your nose bleeds,” says Terenty, pointing to a woolly-looking flower. “It does good.” They hear a whistle and a rumble, but not such a rumble as the storm-clouds carried away. A goods train races by before the eyes of Terenty, Danilka, and Fyokla. The engine, panting and puffing out black smoke, drags more than twenty vans after it. Its power is tremendous. The children are interested to know how an engine, not alive and without the help of horses, can move and drag such weights, and Terenty undertakes to explain it to them: “It’s all the steam’s doing, children. The steam does the work. You see, it shoves under that thing near the wheels, and it works.” They cross the railway line, and, going down from the embankment, walk towards the river. They walk not with any object, but just at random, and talk all the way. Danilka asks questions, Terenty answers them. Terenty answers all his questions, and there is no secret in Nature which baffles him. He knows everything. Thus, for example, he knows the names of all the wild flowers, animals, and stones. He knows what herbs cure diseases, he has no difficulty in telling the age of a horse or a cow. Looking at the sunset, at the moon, or the birds, he can tell what sort of weather it will be next day. And indeed, it is not only Terenty who is so wise. Silanty Silitch, the innkeeper, the market-gardener, the shepherd, and all the villagers, generally speaking, know as much as he does. These people have learned not from books, but in the fields, in the wood, on the river bank. Their teachers have been the birds themselves, when they sang to them, the sun when it left a glow of crimson behind it at setting, the very trees, and wild herbs. Danilka looks at Terenty and greedily drinks in every word. In spring, before one is weary of the warmth and the monotonous green of the fields, when everything is fresh and full of fragrance, who would not want to hear about the golden may-beetles, about the cranes, about the gurgling streams, and the corn mounting into ear? The two of them, the cobbler and the orphan, walk about the fields, talk unceasingly, and are not weary. They could wander about the world endlessly. They walk, and in their talk of the beauty of the earth do not notice the frail little beggar-girl tripping after them. She is breathless and moves with a lagging step. There are tears in her eyes; she would be glad to stop these inexhaustible wanderers, but to whom and where can she go? She has no home or people of her own; whether she likes it or not, she must walk and listen to their talk. Towards midday, all three sit down on the river bank. Danilka takes out of his bag a piece of bread, soaked and reduced to a mash, and they begin to eat. Terenty says a prayer when he has eaten the bread, then stretches himself on the sandy bank and falls asleep. While he is asleep, the boy gazes at the water, pondering. He has many different things to think of. He has just seen the storm, the bees, the ants, the train. Now, before his eyes, fishes are whisking about. Some are two inches long and more, others are no bigger than one’s nail. A viper, with its head held high, is swimming from one bank to the other. Only towards the evening our wanderers return to the village. The children go for the night to a deserted barn, where the corn of the commune used to be kept, while Terenty, leaving them, goes to the tavern. The children lie huddled together on the straw, dozing. The boy does not sleep. He gazes into the darkness, and it seems to him that he is seeing all that he has seen in the day: the storm-clouds, the bright sunshine, the birds, the fish, lanky Terenty. The number of his impressions, together with exhaustion and hunger, are too much for him; he is as hot as though he were on fire, and tosses from side to side. He longs to tell someone all that is haunting him now in the darkness and agitating his soul, but there is no one to tell. Fyokla is too little and could not understand. “I’ll tell Terenty to-morrow,” thinks the boy. The children fall asleep thinking of the homeless cobbler, and, in the night, Terenty comes to them, makes the sign of the cross over them, and puts bread under their heads. And no one sees his love. It is seen only by the moon which floats in the sky and peeps caressingly through the holes in the wall of the deserted barn.
Once upon a time there were two Officials. They were both empty-headed, and so they found themselves one day suddenly transported to an uninhabited isle, as if on a magic carpet.  They had passed their whole life in a Government Department, where records were kept; had been born there, bred there, grown old there, and consequently hadn't the least understanding for anything outside of the Department; and the only words they knew were: "With assurances of the highest esteem, I am your humble servant."  But the Department was abolished, and as the services of the two Officials were no longer needed, they were given their freedom. So the retired Officials migrated to Podyacheskaya Street in St. Petersburg. Each had his own home, his own cook and his pension.  Waking up on the uninhabited isle, they found themselves lying under the same cover. At first, of course, they couldn't understand what had happened to them, and they spoke as if nothing extraordinary had taken place.  "What a peculiar dream I had last night, your Excellency," said the one Official. "It seemed to me as if I were on an uninhabited isle."  Scarcely had he uttered the words, when he jumped to his feet. The other Official also jumped up.  "Good Lord, what does this mean! Where are we?" they cried out in astonishment.  They felt each other to make sure that they were no longer dreaming, and finally convinced themselves of the sad reality.  Before them stretched the ocean, and behind them was a little spot of earth, beyond which the ocean stretched again. They began to cry—the first time since their Department had been shut down.  They looked at each other, and each noticed that the other was clad in nothing but his night shirt with his order hanging about his neck.  "We really should be having our coffee now," observed the one Official. Then he bethought himself again of the strange situation he was in and a second time fell to weeping.  "What are we going to do now?" he sobbed. "Even supposing we were to draw up a report, what good would that do?"  "You know what, your Excellency," replied the other Official, "you go to the east and I will go to the west. Toward evening we will come back here again and, perhaps, we shall have found something."  They started to ascertain which was the east and which was the west. They recalled that the head of their Department had once said to them, "If you want to know where the east is, then turn your face to the north, and the east will be on your right." But when they tried to find out which was the north, they turned to the right and to the left and looked around on all sides. Having spent their whole life in the Department of Records, their efforts were all in vain.  "To my mind, your Excellency, the best thing to do would be for you to go to the right and me to go to the left," said one Official, who had served not only in the Department of Records, but had also been teacher of handwriting in the School for Reserves, and so was a little bit cleverer.  So said, so done. The one Official went to the right. He came upon trees, bearing all sorts of fruits. Gladly would he have plucked an apple, but they all hung so high that he would have been obliged to climb up. He tried to climb up in vain. All he succeeded in doing was tearing his night shirt. Then he struck upon a brook. It was swarming with fish.  "Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had all this fish in Podyacheskaya Street!" he thought, and his mouth watered. Then he entered woods and found partridges, grouse and hares.  "Good Lord, what an abundance of food!" he cried. His hunger was going up tremendously.  But he had to return to the appointed spot with empty hands. He found the other Official waiting for him.  "Well, Your Excellency, how went it? Did you find anything?"  "Nothing but an old number of the Moscow Gazette, not another thing."  The Officials lay down to sleep again, but their empty stomachs gave them no rest They were partly robbed of their sleep by the thought of who was now enjoying their pension, and partly by the recollection of the fruit, fishes, partridges, grouse and hares that they had seen during the day.  "The human pabulum in its original form flies, swims and grows on trees. Who would have thought it your Excellency?" said the one Official.  "To be sure," rejoined the other Official. "I, too, must admit that I had imagined that our breakfast rolls, came into the world just as they appear on the table."  "From which it is to be deduced that if we want to eat a pheasant, we must catch it first, kill it, pull its feathers and roast it. But how's that to be done?"  "Yes, how's that to be done?" repeated the other Official.  They turned silent and tried again to fall asleep, but their hunger scared sleep away. Before their eyes swarmed flocks of pheasants and ducks, herds of porklings, and they were all so juicy, done so tenderly and garnished so deliciously with olives, capers and pickles.  "I believe I could devour my own boots now," said the one Official.  "Gloves, are not bad either, especially if they have been born quite mellow," said the other Official.  The two Officials stared at each other fixedly. In their glances gleamed an evil-boding fire, their teeth chattered and a dull groaning issued from their breasts. Slowly they crept upon each other and suddenly they burst into a fearful frenzy. There was a yelling and groaning, the rags flew about, and the Official who had been teacher of handwriting bit off his colleague's order and swallowed it. However, the sight of blood brought them both back to their senses.  "God help us!" they cried at the same time. "We certainly don't mean to eat each other up. How could we have come to such a pass as this? What evil genius is making sport of us?"  "We must, by all means, entertain each other to pass the time away, otherwise there will be murder and death," said the, one Official.  "You begin," said the other.  "Can you explain why it is that the sun first rises and then sets? Why isn't it the reverse?"  "Aren't you a funny, man, your Excellency? You get up first, then you go to your office and work there, and at night you lie down to sleep."  "But why can't one assume the opposite, that is, that one goes to, bed, sees all sorts of dream figures, and then gets up?"  "Well, yes, certainly. But when I was still an Official, I always thought this way: 'Now it is; dawn, then it will be day, then will come supper, and finally will come the time to go to bed.'"  The word "supper" recalled that incident in the day's doings, and the thought of it made both Officials melancholy, so that the conversation came to a halt.  "A doctor once told me that human beings can sustain themselves for a long time on their own juices," the one Official began again.  "What does that mean?"  "It is quite simple. You see, one's own juices generate other juices, and these in their turn still other juices, and so it goes on until finally all the juices are consumed."  "And then what happens?"  "Then food has to be taken into the system again."  "The devil!"  No matter what topic the Officials chose, the conversation invariably reverted to the subject of eating; which only increased their appetite more and more. So they decided to give up talking altogether, and, recollecting the Moscow Gazette that the one of them had found, they picked it up and began to read eagerly.   BANQUET GIVEN BY THE MAYOR  "The table was set for one hundred persons. The magnificence of it exceeded all expectations. The remotest provinces were represented at this feast of the gods by the costliest gifts. The golden sturgeon from Sheksna and the silver pheasant from the Caucasian woods held a rendezvous with strawberries so seldom to be had in our latitude in winter..."  "The devil! For God's sake, stop reading, your Excellency. Couldn't you find something else to read about?" cried the other Official in sheer desperation. He snatched the paper from his colleague's hands, and started to read something else.  "Our correspondent in Tula informs us that yesterday a sturgeon was found in the Upa (an event which even the oldest inhabitants cannot recall, and all the more remarkable since they recognised the former police captain in this sturgeon). This was made the occasion for giving a banquet in the club. The prime cause of the banquet was served in a large wooden platter garnished with vinegar pickles. A bunch of parsley stuck out of its mouth. Doctor P—— who acted as toast-master saw to it that everybody present got a piece of the sturgeon. The sauces to go with it were unusually varied and delicate—"  "Permit me, your Excellency, it seems to me you are not so careful either in the selection of reading matter," interrupted the first Official, who secured the Gazette again and started to read:  "One of the oldest inhabitants of Viatka has discovered a new and highly original recipe for fish soup; A live codfish (lota vulgaris) is taken and beaten with a rod until its liver swells up with anger..."  The Officials' heads drooped. Whatever their eyes fell upon had something to do with eating. Even their own thoughts were fatal. No matter how much they tried to keep their minds off beefsteak and the like, it was all in vain; their fancy returned invariably, with irresistible force, back to that for which they were so painfully yearning.  Suddenly an inspiration came to the Official who had once taught handwriting.  "I have it!" he cried delightedly. "What do you say to this, your Excellency? What do you say to our finding a muzhik?"  "A muzhik, your Excellency? What sort of a muzhik?"  "Why a plain ordinary muzhik. A muzhik like all other muzhiks. He would get the breakfast rolls for us right away, and he could also catch partridges and fish for us."  "Hm, a muzhik. But where are we to fetch one from, if there is no muzhik here?"  "Why shouldn't there be a muzhik here? There are muzhiks everywhere. All one has to do is hunt for them. There certainly must be a muzhik hiding here somewhere so as to get out of working."  This thought so cheered the Officials that they instantly jumped up to go in search of a muzhik.  For a long while they wandered about on the island without the desired result, until finally a concentrated smell of black bread and old sheep skin assailed their nostrils and guided them in the right direction. There under a tree was a colossal muzhik lying fast asleep with his hands under his head. It was clear that to escape his duty to work he had impudently withdrawn to this island. The indignation of the Officials knew no bounds.  "What, lying asleep here you lazy-bones you!" they raged at him, "It is nothing to you that there are two Officials here who are fairly perishing of hunger. Up, forward, march, work."  The Muzhik rose and looked at the two severe gentlemen standing in front of him. His first thought was to make his escape, but the Officials held him fast.  He had to submit to his fate. He had to work.  First he climbed up on a tree and plucked several dozen of the finest apples for the Officials. He kept a rotten one for himself. Then he turned up the earth and dug out some potatoes. Next he started a fire with two bits of wood that he rubbed against each other. Out of his own hair he made a snare and caught partridges. Over the fire, by this time burning brightly, he cooked so many kinds of food that the question arose in the Officials' minds whether they shouldn't give some to this idler.  Beholding the efforts of the Muzhik, they rejoiced in their hearts. They had already forgotten how the day before they had nearly been perishing of hunger, and all they thought of now was: "What a good thing it is to be an Official. Nothing bad can ever happen to an Official."  "Are you satisfied, gentlemen?" the lazy Muzhik asked.  "Yes, we appreciate your industry," replied the Officials.  "Then you will permit me to rest a little?"  "Go take a little rest, but first make a good strong cord."  The Muzhik gathered wild hemp stalks, laid them in water, beat them and broke them, and toward evening a good stout cord was ready. The Officials took the cord and bound the Muzhik to a tree, so that he should not run away. Then they laid themselves to sleep.  Thus day after day passed, and the Muzhik became so skilful that he could actually cook soup for the Officials in his bare hands. The Officials had become round and well-fed and happy. It rejoiced them that here they needn't spend any money and that in the meanwhile their pensions were accumulating in St. Petersburg.  "What is your opinion, your Excellency," one said to the other after breakfast one day, "is the Story of the Tower of Babel true? Don't you think it is simply an allegory?"  "By no means, your Excellency, I think it was something that really happened. What other explanation is there for the existence of so many different languages on earth?"  "Then the Flood must really have taken place, too?"  "Certainly, else; how would you explain the existence of Antediluvian animals? Besides, the Moscow Gazette says——"  They made search for the old number of the Moscow Gazette, seated themselves in the shade, and read the whole sheet from beginning to end. They read of festivities in Moscow, Tula, Penza and Riazan, and strangely enough felt no discomfort at the description of the delicacies served.  There is no saying how long this life might have lasted. Finally, however, it began to bore the Officials. They often thought of their cooks in St. Petersburg, and even shed a few tears in secret.  "I wonder how it looks in Podyacheskaya Street now, your Excellency," one of them said to the other.  "Oh, don't remind me of it, your Excellency. I am pining away with homesickness."  "It is very nice here. There is really no fault to be found with this place, but the lamb longs for its mother sheep. And it is a pity, too, for the beautiful uniforms."  "Yes, indeed, a uniform of the fourth class is no joke. The gold embroidery alone is enough to make one dizzy."  Now they began to importune the Muzhik to find some way of getting them back to Podyacheskaya Street, and strange to say, the Muzhik even knew where Podyacheskaya Street was. He had once drunk beer and mead there, and as the saying goes, everything had run down his beard, alas, but nothing into his mouth. The Officials rejoiced and said: "We are Officials from Podyacheskaya Street."  "And I am one of those men—do you remember?—who sit on a scaffolding hung by ropes from the roofs and paint the outside walls. I am one of those who crawl about on the roofs like flies. That is what I am," replied the Muzhik.  The Muzhik now pondered long and heavily on how to give great pleasure to his Officials, who had been so gracious to him, the lazy-bones, and had not scorned his work. And he actually succeeded in constructing a ship. It was not really a ship, but still it was a vessel, that would carry them across the ocean close to Podyacheskaya Street.  "Now, take care, you dog, that you don't drown us," said the Officials, when they saw the raft rising and falling on the waves.  "Don't be afraid. We muzhiks are used to this," said the Muzhik, making all the preparations for the journey. He gathered swan's-down and made a couch for his two Officials, then he crossed himself and rowed off from shore.  How frightened the Officials were on the way, how seasick they were during the storms, how they scolded the coarse Muzhik for his idleness, can neither be told nor described. The Muzhik, however, just kept rowing on and fed his Officials on herring. At last, they caught sight of dear old Mother Neva. Soon they were in the glorious Catherine Canal, and then, oh joy! they struck the grand Podyacheskaya Street. When the cooks saw their Officials so well-fed, round and so happy, they rejoiced immensely. The Officials drank coffee and rolls, then put on their uniforms and drove to the Pension Bureau. How much money they collected there is another thing that can neither be told nor described. Nor was the Muzhik forgotten. The Officials sent a glass of whiskey out to him and five kopeks. Now, Muzhik, rejoice.
Two friends -- one a fat man and the other a thin man -- met at the Nikolaevsky station. The fat man had just dined in the station and his greasy lips shone like ripe cherries. He smelt of sherry and fleur d'orange. The thin man had just slipped out of the train and was laden with portmanteaus, bundles, and bandboxes. He smelt of ham and coffee grounds. A thin woman with a long chin, his wife, and a tall schoolboy with one eye screwed up came into view behind his back.  "Porfiry," cried the fat man on seeing the thin man. "Is it you? My dear fellow! How many summers, how many winters!"     "Holy saints!" cried the thin man in amazement. "Misha! The friend of my childhood! Where have you dropped from?"  The friends kissed each other three times, and gazed at each other with eyes full of tears. Both were agreeably astounded.  "My dear boy!" began the thin man after the kissing. "This is unexpected! This is a surprise! Come have a good look at me! Just as handsome as I used to be! Just as great a darling and a dandy! Good gracious me! Well, and how are you? Made your fortune? Married? I am married as you see. . . . This is my wife Luise, her maiden name was Vantsenbach . . . of the Lutheran persuasion. . . . And this is my son Nafanail, a schoolboy in the third class. This is the friend of my childhood, Nafanya. We were boys at school together!"  Nafanail thought a little and took off his cap.  "We were boys at school together," the thin man went on. "Do you remember how they used to tease you? You were nicknamed Herostratus because you burned a hole in a schoolbook with a cigarette, and I was nicknamed Ephialtes because I was fond of telling tales. Ho--ho! . . . we were children! . . . Don't be shy, Nafanya. Go nearer to him. And this is my wife, her maiden name was Vantsenbach, of the Lutheran persuasion. . . ."  Nafanail thought a little and took refuge behind his father's back.     "Well, how are you doing my friend?" the fat man asked, looking enthusiastically at his friend. "Are you in the service? What grade have you reached?"  "I am, dear boy! I have been a collegiate assessor for the last two years and I have the Stanislav. The salary is poor, but that's no great matter! The wife gives music lessons, and I go in for carving wooden cigarette cases in a private way. Capital cigarette cases! I sell them for a rouble each. If any one takes ten or more I make a reduction of course. We get along somehow. I served as a clerk, you know, and now I have been transferred here as a head clerk in the same department. I am going to serve here. And what about you? I bet you are a civil councillor by now? Eh?"  "No dear boy, go higher than that," said the fat man. "I have risen to privy councillor already . . . I have two stars."  The thin man turned pale and rigid all at once, but soon his face twisted in all directions in the broadest smile; it seemed as though sparks were flashing from his face and eyes. He squirmed, he doubled together, crumpled up. . . . His portmanteaus, bundles and cardboard boxes seemed to shrink and crumple up too. . . . His wife's long chin grew longer still; Nafanail drew himself up to attention and fastened all the buttons of his uniform.     "Your Excellency, I . . . delighted! The friend, one may say, of childhood and to have turned into such a great man! He--he!"  "Come, come!" the fat man frowned. "What's this tone for? You and I were friends as boys, and there is no need of this official obsequiousness!"  "Merciful heavens, your Excellency! What are you saying. . . ?" sniggered the thin man, wriggling more than ever. "Your Excellency's gracious attention is like refreshing manna. . . . This, your Excellency, is my son Nafanail, . . . my wife Luise, a Lutheran in a certain sense."  The fat man was about to make some protest, but the face of the thin man wore an expression of such reverence, sugariness, and mawkish respectfulness that the privy councillor was sickened. He turned away from the thin man, giving him his hand at parting.  The thin man pressed three fingers, bowed his whole body and sniggered like a Chinaman: "He--he--he!" His wife smiled. Nafanail scraped with his foot and dropped his cap. All three were agreeably overwhelmed.
I  Through the bloody September twilight, aftermath of sixty-two rainless days, it had gone like a fire in dry grass---the rumor, the story, whatever it was. Something about Miss Minnie Cooper and a Negro. Attacked, insulted, frightened: none of them, gathered in the barber shop on that Saturday evening where the ceiling fan stirred, without freshening it, the vitiated air, sending back upon them, in recurrent surges of stale pomade and lotion, their own stale breath and odors, knew exactly what had happened.  "Except it wasn't Will Mayes," a barber said. He was a man of middle age; a thin, sand-colored man with a mild face, who was shaving a client. "I know Will Mayes. He's a good nigger. And I know Miss Minnie Cooper, too."  "What do you know about her?" a second barber said.  "Who is she?" the client said. "A young girl?"  "No," the barber said. "She's about forty, I reckon. She aint married. That's why I dont believe--"  "Believe, hell!" a hulking youth in a sweat-stained silk shirt said. "Wont you take a white woman's word before a nigger's?  "I dont believe Will Mayes did it," the barber said. "I know Will Mayes."  "Maybe you know who did it, then. Maybe you already got him out of town, you damn niggerlover."  "I dont believe anybody did anything. I dont believe any-thing happened. I leave it to you fellows if them ladies that get old without getting married dont have notions that a man cant-"  "Then you are a hell of a white man," the client said. He moved under the cloth. The youth had sprung to his feet.  "You dont?" he said. "Do you accuse a white woman of lying?"  The barber held the razor poised above the half-risen client. He did not look around.  "It's this durn weather," another said. "It's enough to make a man do anything. Even to her."  Nobody laughed. The barber said in his mild, stubborn tone: "I aint accusing nobody of nothing. I just know and you fellows know how a woman that never-- "  "You damn niggerlover! " the youth said.  "Shut up, Butch," another said. "We'll get the facts in plenty of time to act."  "Who is? Who's getting them?" the youth said. "Facts, hell! I--"  "You're a fine white man," the client said. "Aint you?" In his frothy beard he looked like a desert rat in the moving pictures. "You tell them, Jack," he said to the youth. "If there aint any white men in this town, you can count on me, even if I aint only a drummer and a stranger."  "That's right, boys," the barber said. "Find out the truth first. I know Will Mayes."  "Well, by God!" the youth shouted. "To think that a white man in this town--"  "Shut up, Butch," the second speaker said. "We got plenty of time."  The client sat up. He looked at the speaker. "Do you claim that anything excuses a nigger attacking a white woman? Do you mean to tell me you are a white man and you'll stand for it? You better go back North where you came from. The South dont want your kind here."  "North what?" the second said. "I was born and raised in this town."  "Well, by God!" the youth said. He looked about with a strained, baffled gaze, as if he was trying to remember what it was he wanted to say or to do. He drew his sleeve across his sweating face. "Damn if I'm going to let a white woman--"  "You tell them, Jack," the drummer said. "By God, if they--"  The screen door crashed open. A man stood in the floor, his feet apart and his heavy-set body poised easily. His white shirt was open at the throat; he wore a felt hat. His hot, bold glance swept the group. His name was McLendon. He had commanded troops at the front in France and had been decorated for valor.  "Well," he said, "are you going to sit there and let a black son rape a white woman on the streets of Jefferson?"  Butch sprang up again. The silk of his shirt clung flat to his heavy shoulders. At each armpit was a dark halfmoon. "That's what I been telling them! That's what I--"  "Did it really happen?" a third said. "This aint the first man scare she ever had, like Hawkshaw says. Wasn't there something about a man on the kitchen  roof, watching her undress, about a year ago?"  "What?" the client said. "What's that?" The barber had been slowly forcing him back into the chair; he arrested himself reclining, his head lifted, the barber still pressing him down.  McLendon whirled on the third speaker. "Happen? What the hell difference does it make? Are you going to let the black sons get away with it until one really does it?"  "That's what I'm telling them!" Butch shouted. He cursed, long and steady, pointless.  "Here, here," a fourth said. "Not so loud. Dont talk so loud."  "Sure," McLendon said; "no talking necessary at all. I've done my talking. Who's with me?" He poised on the balls of his feet, roving his gaze.  The barber held the drummer's face down, the razor poised. "Find out the facts first, boys. I know Willy Mayes. It wasn't him. Let's get the sheriff and do this thing right."  McLendon whirled upon him his furious, rigid face. The barber did not look away. They looked like men of different races. The other barbers had ceased also above their prone clients. "You mean to tell me," McLendon said, "that you'd take a nigger's word before a white woman's? Why, you damn niggerloving--"  The third speaker rose and grasped McLendon's arm; he too had been a soldier. "Now, now. Let's figure this thing out. Who knows anything about what really happened?"  "Figure out hell!" McLendon jerked his arm free. "All that're with me get up from there. The ones that aint--" He roved his gaze, dragging his sleeve across his face.  Three men rose. The drummer in the chair sat up. "Here," he said, jerking at the cloth about his neck; "get this rag off me. I'm with him. I dont live here, but by God, if our mothers and wives and sisters--" He smeared the cloth over his face and flung it to the floor. McLendon stood in the floor and cursed the others. Another rose and moved toward him. The remainder sat uncomfortable, not looking at one another, then one by one they rose and joined him.  The barber picked the cloth from the floor. He began to fold it neatly. "Boys, dont do that. Will Mayes never done it. I know."  "Come on," McLendon said. He whirled. From his hip pocket protruded the butt of a heavy automatic pistol. They went out. The screen door crashed behind them reverberant in the dead air.  The barber wiped the razor carefully and swiftly, and put it away, and ran to the rear, and took his hat from the wall. "I'll be back as soon as I can," he said to the other barbers. "I cant let--" He went out, running. The two other barbers followed him to the door and caught it on the re-bound, leaning out and looking up the street after him. The air was flat and dead. It had a metallic taste at the base of the tongue.  "What can he do?" the first said. The second one was saying "Jees Christ, Jees Christ" under his breath. "I'd just as lief be Will Mayes as Hawk, if he gets McLendon riled."  "Jees Christ, Jees Christ," the second whispered.  "You reckon he really done it to her?" the first said. II  SHE WAS thirty-eight or thirty-nine. She lived in a small frame house with her invalid mother and a thin, sallow, un-flagging aunt, where each morning between ten and eleven she would appear on the porch in a lace-trimmed boudoir cap, to sit swinging in the porch swing until noon. After dinner she lay down for a while, until the afternoon began to cool. Then, in one of the three or four new voile dresses which she had each summer, she would go downtown to spend the afternoon in the stores with the other ladies, where they would handle the goods and haggle over the prices in cold, immediate voices, without any intention of buying.  She was of comfortable people--not the best in Jefferson, but good people enough--and she was still on the slender side of ordinary looking, with a bright, faintly haggard man-ner and dress. When she was young she had had a slender, nervous body and a sort of hard vivacity which had enabled her for a time to ride upon the crest of the town's social life as exemplified by the high school party and church social period of her contemporaries while still children enough to be unclassconscious.  She was the last to realize that she was losing ground; that those among whom she had been a little brighter and louder flame than any other were beginning to learn the pleasure of snobbery-male--and retaliation--female. That was when her face began to wear that bright, haggard look. She still carried it to parties on shadowy porticoes and summer lawns, like a mask or a flag, with that bafflement of furious repudiat-ion of truth in her eyes. One evening at a party she heard a boy and two girls, all schoolmates, talking. She never accepted another invitation.  She watched the girls with whom she had grown up as they married and got homes and children, but no man ever called on her steadily until the children of the other girls had been calling her "aunty" for several years, the while their mothers told them in bright voices about how popular Aunt Minnie had been as a girl. Then the town began to see her driving on Sunday afternoons with the cashier in the bank. He was a widower of about forty--a high-colored man,  smelling always faintly of the barber shop or of whisky. He owned the first automobile in town, a red runabout; Minnie had the first motoring bonnet and veil the town ever saw. Then the town began to say: "Poor Minnie." "But she is old enough to take care of herself," others said. That was when she began to ask her old schoolmates that their children call her "cousin" instead of "aunty."  It was twelve years now since she had been relegated into adultery by public opinion, and eight years since the cashier had gone to a Memphis bank, returning for one day each Christmas, which he spent at an annual bachelors' party at a hunting club on the river. From behind their curtains the neighbors would see the party pass, and during the over-the-way Christmas day visiting they would tell her about him, about how well he looked, and how they heard that he was prospering in the city, watching with bright, secret eyes her haggard, bright face. Usually by that hour there would be the scent of whisky on her breath. It was supplied her by a youth, a clerk at the soda fountain: "Sure; I buy it for the old gal. I reckon she's entitled to a little fun."  Her mother kept to her room altogether now; the gaunt aunt ran the house. Against that background Minnie's bright dresses, her idle and empty days, had a quality of furious unreality. She went out in the evenings only with women now, neighbors, to the moving pictures. Each afternoon she dressed in one of the new dresses and went downtown alone, where her young "cousins" were already strolling in the late afternoons with their delicate, silken heads and thin, awk-ward arms and conscious hips, clinging to one another or shrieking and giggling with paired boys in the soda fountain when she passed and went on along the serried store fronts, in the doors of which the sitting and lounging men did not even follow her with their eyes any more. III  THE BARBER WENT SWIFTLY up the street where the sparse lights, insectswirled, glared in rigid and violent suspension in the lifeless air. The day had died in a pall of dust; above the darkened square, shrouded by the spent dust, the sky was as clear as the inside of a brass bell. Below the cast was a rumor of the twice-waxed moon.  When he overtook them McLendon and three others were getting into a car parked in an alley. McLendon stooped his thick head, peering out beneath the top. "Changed your mind, did you?" he said. "Damn good thing; by God, tomorrow when this town hears about how you talked tonight-"  "Now, now," the other ex-soldier said. "Hawkshaw's all right. Come on, Hawk; jump in."  "Will Mayes never done it, boys," the barber said. "If anybody done it. Why, you all know well as I do there aint any town where they got better niggers than us. And you know how a lady will kind of think things about men when there aint any reason to, and Miss Minnie anyway-"  "Sure, sure," the soldier said. "We're just going to talk to him a little; that's  all."  "Talk hell!" Butch said. "When we're through with the-"  "Shut up, for God's sake!" the soldier said. "Do you want everybody in town- "  "Tell them, by God!" McLendon said. "Tell every one of the sons that'll let a white woman-"  "Let's go; let's go: here's the other car." The second car slid squealing out of a cloud of dust at the alley mouth. McLendon started his car and took the lead. Dust lay like fog in the street. The street lights hung nimbused as in water. They drove on out of town.  A rutted lane turned at right angles. Dust hung above it too, and above all the land. The dark bulk of the ice plant, where the Negro Mayes was night watchman, rose against the sky. "Better stop here, hadn't we?" the soldier said. McLendon did not reply. He hurled the car up and slammed to a stop, the headlights glaring on the blank wall.  "Listen here, boys," the barber said; "if he's here, dont that prove he never done it? Dont it? If it was him, he would run. Dont you see he would?" The second car came up and stopped. McLendon got down; Butch sprang down beside him. "Listen, boys," the barber said.  "Cut the lights off!" McLendon said. The breathless dark rushed down. There was no sound in it save their lungs as they sought air in the parched dust in which for two months they had lived; then the diminishing crunch of McLendon's and Butch's feet, and a moment later McLendon's voice:  "Will! . . . Will!"  Below the cast the wan hemorrhage of the moon increased. It heaved above the ridge, silvering the air, the dust, so that they seemed to breathe, live, in a bowl of molten lead. There was no sound of nightbird nor insect, no sound save their breathing and a faint ticking of contracting metal about the cars. Where their bodies touched one another they seemed to sweat dryly, for no more moisture came. "Christ! " a voice said; "let's get out of here."  But they didn't move until vague noises began to grow out of the darkness ahead; then they got out and waited tensely in the breathless dark. There was another sound: a blow, a hissing expulsion of breath and McLendon cursing in undertone. They stood a moment longer, then they ran forward. They ran in a stumbling clump, as though they were fleeing something. "Kill him, kill the son," a voice whispered. McLendon flung them back.  "Not here," he said. "Get him into the car." "Kill him kill the black son!" the voice murmured. They dragged the Negro to the car. The barber had waited beside the car. He could feel himself sweating and he knew he was going to be  sick at the stomach.  "What is it, captains?" the Negro said. "I aint done nothing. 'Fore God, Mr John." Someone produced handcuffs. They worked busily about the Negro as though he were a post, quiet, intent, getting in one another's way. He submitted to the handcuffs, looking swiftly and constantly from dim face to dim face. "Who's here, captains?" he said, leaning to peer into the faces until they could feel his breath and smell his sweaty reek. He spoke a name or two. "What you all say I done, Mr John?"  McLendon jerked the car door open. "Get in!" he said.  The Negro did not move. "What you all going to do with me, Mr John? I aint done nothing. White folks, captains, I aint done nothing: I swear 'fore God." He called another name.  "Get in!" McLendon said. He struck the Negro. The others expelled their breath in a dry hissing and struck him with random blows and he whirled and cursed them, and swept his manacled hands across their faces and slashed the barber upon the mouth, and the barber struck him also. "Get him in there," McLendon said. They pushed at him. He ceased struggling and got in and sat quietly as the others took their places. He sat between the barber and the soldier, drawing his limbs in so as not to touch them, his eyes going swiftly and constantly from face to face. Butch clung to the running board. The car moved on. The barber nursed his mouth with his handkerchief.  "What's the matter, Hawk?" the soldier said.  'Nothing," the barber said. They regained the highroad and turned away from town. The second car dropped back out of the dust. They went on, gaining speed; the final fringe of houses dropped behind.  "Goddamn, he stinks!" the soldier said.  "We'll fix that," the drummer in front beside McLendon said. On the running board Butch cursed into the hot rush of air. The barber leaned suddenly forward and touched McLendon's arm.  "Let me out, John," he said.  "Jump out, niggerlover," McLendon said without turning his head. He drove swiftly. Behind them the sourceless lights of the second car glared in the dust. Presently McLendon turned into a narrow road. It was rutted with disuse. It led back to an abandoned brick kiln--a series of reddish mounds and weed- and vine-choked vats without bottom. It had been used for pasture once, until one day the owner missed one of his mules. Although he prodded carefully in the vats with a long pole, he could not even find the bottom of them.  "John," the barber said.  "Jump out, then," McLendon said, hurling the car along the ruts. Beside the barber the Negro spoke:  "Mr Henry."  The barber sat forward. The narrow tunnel of the road rushed up and past. Their motion was like an extinct furnace blast: cooler, but utterly dead. The car bounded from rut to rut.  "Mr Henry," the Negro said.  The barber began to tug furiously at the door. "Look out, there!" the soldier said, but the barber had already kicked the door open and swung onto the running board. The soldier leaned across the Negro and grasped at him, but he had already jumped. "The car went on without checking speed.  The impetus hurled him crashing through dust-sheathed weeds, into the ditch. Dust puffed about him, and in a thin, vicious crackling of sapless stems he lay choking and retching until the second car passed and died away. Then he rose and limped on until he reached the highroad and turned toward town, brushing at his clothes with his hands. The moon was higher, riding high and clear of the dust at last, and after a while the town began to glare beneath the dust. He went on, limping. Presently he heard cars and the glow of them grew in the dust behind him and he left the road and crouched again in the weeds until they passed. McLendon's car came last now. There were four people in it and Butch was not on the running board.  They went on; the dust swallowed them; the glare and the sound died away. The dust of them hung for a while, but soon the eternal dust absorbed it again. The barber climbed back onto the road and limped on toward town. IV  AS SHE DRESSED for supper on that Saturday evening, her own flesh felt like fever. Her hands trembled among the hooks and eyes, and her eyes had a feverish look, and her hair swirled crisp and crackling under the comb. While she was still dressing the friends called for her and sat while she donned her sheerest underthings and stockings and a new voile dress. "Do you feel strong enough to go out?" they said, their eyes bright too, with a dark glitter. "When you have had time to get over the shock, you must tell us what happened. What he said and did; everything."  In the leafed darkness, as they walked toward the square, she began to breathe deeply, something like a swimmer pre-paring to dive, until she ceased trembling, the four of them walking slowly because of the terrible heat and out of solicitude for her. But as they neared the square she began to tremble again, walking with her head up her hands clenched at her sides, their voices about her murmurous, also with that feverish, glittering quality of their eyes.  They entered the square, she in the center of the group, fragile in her fresh  dress. She was trembling worse. She walked slower and slower, as children eat ice cream, her head up and her eyes bright in the haggard banner of her face, passing the hotel and the coatless drummers in chairs along the curb looking around at her: "That's the one: see? The one in pink in the middle." "Is that her? What did they do with the nigger? Did they--?" "Sure. He's all right." "All right, is he?" "Sure. He went on a little trip." Then the drug store, where even the young men lounging in the door-way tipped their hats and followed with, their eyes the motion of her hips and legs when she passed.  They went on, passing the lifted hats of the gentlemen, the suddenly ceased voices, deferent, protective. "Do you see?" the friends said. Their voices sounded like long, hovering sighs of hissing exultation. "There's not a Negro on the square. Not one."  They reached the picture show. It was like a miniature fairyland with its lighted lobby and colored lithographs of life caught in its terrible and beautiful mutations. Her lips began to tingle. In the dark, when the picture began, it would be all right; she could hold back the laughing so it would not waste away so fast and so soon. So she hurried on before the turning faces, the undertones of low astonishment, and they took their accustomed places where she could see the aisle against the silver glare and the young men and girls coming in two and two against it.  The lights flicked away; the screen glowed silver, and soon life began to unfold, beautiful and passionate and sad, while still the young men and girls entered, scented and sibilant in the half dark, their paired backs in silhouette delicate and sleek, their slim, quick bodies awkward, divinely young, while beyond them the silver dream accumulated, inevitably on and on. She began to laugh. In trying to suppress it, it made more noise than ever; heads began to turn. Still laughing, her friends raised her and led her out, and she stood at the curb, laughing on a high, sustained note, until the taxi came up and they helped her in.  They removed the pink voile and the sheer underthings and the stockings, and put her to bed, and cracked ice for her temples, and sent for the doctor. He was hard to locate, so they ministered to her with hushed ejaculations, renewing the ice and fanning her. While the ice was fresh and cold she stopped laughing and lay still for a time, moaning only a little. But soon the laughing welled again and her voice rose screaming.  "Shhhhhhhhhhh! Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" they said, fresh-ening the icepack, smoothing her hair, examining it for gray; "poor girl!" Then to one another: "Do you suppose anything really happened?" their eyes darkly aglitter, secret and passionate. "Shhhhhhhhhh! Poor girl! Poor Minnie!" V  IT WAS MIDNIGHT when McLendon drove up to his neat new house. It was trim and fresh as a birdcage and almost as small, with its clean, green-andwhite paint. He locked the car and mounted the porch and entered. His wife  rose from a chair beside the reading lamp. McLendon stopped in the floor and stared at her until she looked down.  "Look at that clock," he said, lifting his arm, pointing. She stood before him her face lowered, a magazine in her hands. Her face was pale, strained, and weary-looking. "Haven't I told you about sitting up like this, waiting to see when I come in?"  "John," she said. She laid the magazine down. Poised on the balls of his feet, he glared at her with his hot eyes, his sweating face.  "Didn't I tell you?" He went toward her. She looked up then. He caught her shoulder. She stood passive, looking at him.  "Don't, John. I couldn't sleep . . . The heat; something. Please, John. You're hurting me."  "Didn't I tell you?" He released her and half struck, half flung her across the chair, and she lay there and watched him quietly as he left the room.  He went on through the house, ripping off his shirt, and on the dark, screened porch at the rear he stood and mopped his head and shoulders with the shirt and flung it away. He took the pistol from his hip and laid it on the table beside the bed, and sat on the bed and removed his shoes, and rose and slipped his trousers off. He was sweating again already, and he stooped and hunted furiously for the shirt. At last he found it and wiped his body again, and, with his body pressed against the dusty screen, he stood panting. There was no movement, no sound, not even an insect. The dark world seemed to lie stricken beneath the cold moon and the lidless stars.
MURRAY dreamed a dream.  Both psychology and science grope when they would explain to us the strange adventures of our immaterial selves when wandering in the realm of "Death's twin brother, Sleep." This story will not attempt to be illuminative; it is no more than a record of Murray's dream. One of the most puzzling phases of that strange waking sleep is that dreams which seem to cover months or even years may take place within a few seconds or minutes.  Murray was waiting in his cell in the ward of the condemned. An electric arc light in the ceiling of the corridor shone brightly upon his table. On a sheet of white paper an ant crawled wildly here and there as Murray blocked its way with an envelope. The electrocution was set for eight o'clock in the evening. Murray smiled at the antics of the wisest of insects.  There were seven other condemned men in the chamber. Since he had been there Murray had seen three taken out to their fate; one gone mad and fighting like a wolf caught in a trap; one, no less mad, offering up a sanctimonious lip-service to Heaven; the third, a weakling, collapsed and strapped to a board. He wondered with what credit to himself his own heart, foot, and face would meet his punishment; for this was his evening. He thought it must be nearly eight o'clock.  Opposite his own in the two rows of cells was the cage of Bonifacio, the Sicilian slayer of his betrothed and of two officers who came to arrest him. With him Murray had played checkers many a long hour, each calling his move to his unseen opponent across the corridor.  Bonifacio's great booming voice with its indestructible singing quality called out:  "Eh, Meestro Murray; how you feel--all-a right--yes?"  "All right, Bonifacio," said Murray steadily, as he allowed the ant to crawl upon the envelope and then dumped it gently on the stone floor.  "Dat's good-a, Meestro Murray. Men like us, we must-a die like-a men. My time come nex'-a week. All-a right. Remember, Meestro Murray, I beat-a you dat las' game of de check. Maybe we play again some-a time. I don'-a know. Maybe we have to call-a de move damn-a loud to play de check where dey goin' send us."  Bonifacio's hardened philosophy, followed closely by his deafening, musical peal of laughter, warmed rather than chilled Murray's numbed heart. Yet, Bonifacio had until next week to live.  The cell-dwellers heard the familiar, loud click of the steel bolts as the door at the end of the corridor was opened. Three men came to Murray's cell and unlocked it. Two were prison guards; the other was "Len"--no; that was in the old days; now the Reverend Leonard Winston, a friend and neighbor from their barefoot days.  "I got them to let me take the prison chaplain's place," he said, as he gave Murray's hand one short, strong grip. In his left hand he held a small Bible, with his forefinger marking a page.  Murray smiled slightly and arranged two or three books and some penholders orderly on his small table. He would have spoken, but no appropriate words seemed to present themselves to his mind.     The prisoners had christened this cellhouse, eighty feet long, twenty-eight feet wide, Limbo Lane. The regular guard of Limbo Lane, an immense, rough, kindly man, drew a pint bottle of whiskey from his pocket and offered it to Murray, saying:  "It's the regular thing, you know. All has it who feel like they need a bracer. No danger of it becoming a habit with 'em, you see."  Murray drank deep into the bottle.  "That's the boy!" said the guard. "Just a little nerve tonic, and everything goes smooth as silk."  They stepped into the corridor, and each one of the doomed seven knew. Limbo Lane is a world on the outside of the world; but it had learned, when deprived of one or more of the five senses, to make another sense supply the deficiency. Each one knew that it was nearly eight, and that Murray was to go to the chair at eight. There is also in the many Limbo Lanes an aristocracy of crime. The man who kills in the open, who beats his enemy or pursuer down, flushed by the primitive emotions and the ardor of combat, holds in contempt the human rat, the spider, and the snake.     So, of the seven condemned only three called their farewells to Murray as he marched down the corridor between the two guards--Bonifacio, Marvin, who had killed a guard while trying to escape from the prison, and Bassett, the train-robber, who was driven to it because the express-messenger wouldn't raise his hands when ordered to do so. The remaining four smoldered, silent, in their cells, no doubt feeling their social ostracism in Limbo Lane society more keenly than they did the memory of their less picturesque offences against the law.  Murray wondered at his own calmness and nearly indifference. In the execution room were about twenty men, a congregation made up of prison officers, newspaper reporters, and lookers-on who had succeeded  Here, in the very middle of a sentence, the hand of Death interrupted the telling of O. Henry's last story. He had planned to make this story different from his others, the beginning of a new series in a style he had not previously attempted. "I want to show the public," he said, "that I can write something new--new for me, I mean--a story without slang, a straightforward dramatic plot treated in a way that will come nearer my idea of real story-writing." Before starting to write the present story, he outlined briefly how he intended to develop it: Murray, the criminal accused and convicted of the brutal murder of his sweetheart--a murder prompted by jealous rage--at first faces the death penalty, calm, and, to all outward appearances, indifferent to his fate. As he nears the electric chair he is overcome by a revulsion of feeling. He is left dazed, stupefied, stunned. The entire scene in the death-chamber--the witnesses, the spectators, the preparations for execution--become unreal to him. The thought flashes through his brain that a terrible mistake is being made. Why is he being strapped to the chair? What has he done? What crime has he committed? In the few moments while the straps are being adjusted a vision comes to him. He dreams a dream. He sees a little country cottage, bright, sun-lit, nestling in a bower of flowers. A woman is there, and a little child. He speaks with them and finds that they are his wife, his child--and the cottage their home. So, after all, it is a mistake. Some one has frightfully, irretrievably blundered. The accusation, the trial, the conviction, the sentence to death in the electric chair--all a dream. He takes his wife in his arms and kisses the child. Yes, here is happiness. It was a dream. Then--at a sign from the prison warden the fatal current is turned on.  Murray had dreamed the wrong dream.
Returning from a hunting trip, I waited at the little town of Los Pinos, in New Mexico, for the south-bound train, which was one hour late. I sat on the porch of the Summit House and discussed the functions of life with Telemachus Hicks, the hotel proprietor.  Perceiving that personalities were not out of order, I asked him what species of beast had long ago twisted and mutilated his left ear. Being a hunter, I was concerned in the evils that may befall one in the pursuit of game.  "That ear," says Hicks, "is the relic of true friendship."  "An accident?" I persisted.  "No friendship is an accident," said Telemachus; and I was silent.  "The only perfect case of true friendship I ever knew," went on my host, "was a cordial intent between a Connecticut man and a monkey. The monkey climbed palms in Barranquilla and threw down cocoanuts to the man. The man sawed them in two and made dippers, which he sold for two /reales/ each and bought rum. The monkey drank the milk of the nuts. Through each being satisfied with his own share of the graft, they lived like brothers.  "But in the case of human beings, friendship is a transitory art, subject to discontinuance without further notice.  "I had a friend once, of the entitlement of Paisley Fish, that I imagined was sealed to me for an endless space of time. Side by side for seven years we had mined, ranched, sold patent churns, herded sheep, took photographs and other things, built wire fences, and picked prunes. Thinks I, neither homocide nor flattery nor riches nor sophistry nor drink can make trouble between me and Paisley Fish. We was friends an amount you could hardly guess at. We was friends in business, and we let our amicable qualities lap over and season our hours of recreation and folly. We certainly had days of Damon and nights of Pythias.  "One summer me and Paisley gallops down into these San Andres mountains for the purpose of a month's surcease and levity, dressed in the natural store habiliments of man. We hit this town of Los Pinos, which certainly was a roof-garden spot of the world, and flowing with condensed milk and honey. It had a street or two, and air, and hens, and a eating-house; and that was enough for us.  "We strikes the town after supper-time, and we concludes to sample whatever efficacy there is in this eating-house down by the railroad tracks. By the time we had set down and pried up our plates with a knife from the red oil-cloth, along intrudes Widow Jessup with the hot biscuit and the fried liver.  "Now, there was a woman that would have tempted an anchovy to forget his vows. She was not so small as she was large; and a kind of welcome air seemed to mitigate her vicinity. The pink of her face was the /in hoc signo/ of a culinary temper and a warm disposition, and her smile would have brought out the dogwood blossoms in December.  "Widow Jessup talks to us a lot of garrulousness about the climate and history and Tennyson and prunes and the scarcity of mutton, and finally wants to know where we came from.  "'Spring Valley,' says I.  "'Big Spring Valley,' chips in Paisley, out of a lot of potatoes and knuckle-bone of ham in his mouth.  "That was the first sign I noticed that the old /fidus Diogenes/ business between me and Paisley Fish was ended forever. He knew how I hated a talkative person, and yet he stampedes into the conversation with his amendments and addendums of syntax. On the map it was Big Spring Valley; but I had heard Paisley himself call it Spring Valley a thousand times.     "Without saying any more, we went out after supper and set on the railroad track. We had been pardners too long not to know what was going on in each other's mind.  "'I reckon you understand,' says Paisley, 'that I've made up my mind to accrue that widow woman as part and parcel in and to my hereditaments forever, both domestic, sociable, legal, and otherwise, until death us do part.'  "'Why, yes,' says I, 'I read it between the lines, though you only spoke one. And I suppose you are aware,' says I, 'that I have a movement on foot that leads up to the widow's changing her name to Hicks, and leaves you writing to the society column to inquire whether the best man wears a japonica or seamless socks at the wedding!'  "'There'll be some hiatuses in your program,' says Paisley, chewing up a piece of a railroad tie. 'I'd give in to you,' says he, 'in 'most any respect if it was secular affairs, but this is not so. The smiles of woman,' goes on Paisley, 'is the whirlpool of Squills and Chalybeates, into which vortex the good ship Friendship is often drawn and dismembered. I'd assault a bear that was annoying you,' says Paisley, 'or I'd endorse your note, or rub the place between your shoulder-blades with opodeldoc the same as ever; but there my sense of etiquette ceases. In this fracas with Mrs. Jessup we play it alone. I've notified you fair.'     "And then I collaborates with myself, and offers the following resolutions and by-laws:  "'Friendship between man and man,' says I, 'is an ancient historical virtue enacted in the days when men had to protect each other against lizards with eighty-foot tails and flying turtles. And they've kept up the habit to this day, and stand by each other till the bellboy comes up and tells them the animals are not really there. I've often heard,' I says, 'about ladies stepping in and breaking up a friendship between men. Why should that be? I'll tell you, Paisley, the first sight and hot biscuit of Mrs. Jessup appears to have inserted a oscillation into each of our bosoms. Let the best man of us have her. I'll play you a square game, and won't do any underhanded work. I'll do all of my courting of her in your presence, so you will have an equal opportunity. With that arrangement I don't see why our steamboat of friendship should fall overboard in the medicinal whirlpools you speak of, whichever of us wins out.'  "'Good old hoss!' says Paisley, shaking my hand. 'And I'll do the same,' says he. 'We'll court the lady synonymously, and without any of the prudery and bloodshed usual to such occasions. And we'll be friends still, win or lose.'  "At one side of Mrs. Jessup's eating-house was a bench under some trees where she used to sit in the breeze after the south-bound had been fed and gone. And there me and Paisley used to congregate after supper and make partial payments on our respects to the lady of our choice. And we was so honorable and circuitous in our calls that if one of us got there first we waited for the other before beginning any gallivantery.  "The first evening that Mrs. Jessup knew about our arrangement I got to the bench before Paisley did. Supper was just over, and Mrs. Jessup was out there with a fresh pink dress on, and almost cool enough to handle.  "I sat down by her and made a few specifications about the moral surface of nature as set forth by the landscape and the contiguous perspective. That evening was surely a case in point. The moon was attending to business in the section of sky where it belonged, and the trees was making shadows on the ground according to science and nature, and there was a kind of conspicuous hullabaloo going on in the bushes between the bullbats and the orioles and the jack-rabbits and other feathered insects of the forest. And the wind out of the mountains was singing like a Jew's-harp in the pile of old tomato-cans by the railroad track.     "I felt a kind of sensation in my left side--something like dough rising in a crock by the fire. Mrs. Jessup had moved up closer.  "'Oh, Mr. Hicks,' says she, 'when one is alone in the world, don't they feel it more aggravated on a beautiful night like this?'  "I rose up off the bench at once.  "'Excuse me, ma'am,' says I, 'but I'll have to wait till Paisley comes before I can give a audible hearing to leading questions like that.'  "And then I explained to her how we was friends cinctured by years of embarrassment and travel and complicity, and how we had agreed to take no advantage of each other in any of the more mushy walks of life, such as might be fomented by sentiment and proximity. Mrs. Jessup appears to think serious about the matter for a minute, and then she breaks into a species of laughter that makes the wildwood resound.  "In a few minutes Paisley drops around, with oil of bergamot on his hair, and sits on the other side of Mrs. Jessup, and inaugurates a sad tale of adventure in which him and Pieface Lumley has a skinning-match of dead cows in '95 for a silver-mounted saddle in the Santa Rita valley during the nine months' drought.  "Now, from the start of that courtship I had Paisley Fish hobbled and tied to a post. Each one of us had a different system of reaching out for the easy places in the female heart. Paisley's scheme was to petrify 'em with wonderful relations of events that he had either come across personally or in large print. I think he must have got his idea of subjugation from one of Shakespeare's shows I see once called 'Othello.' There is a coloured man in it who acquires a duke's daughter by disbursing to her a mixture of the talk turned out by Rider Haggard, Lew Dockstader, and Dr. Parkhurst. But that style of courting don't work well off the stage.  "Now, I give you my own recipe for inveigling a woman into that state of affairs when she can be referred to as '/nee/ Jones.' Learn how to pick up her hand and hold it, and she's yours. It ain't so easy. Some men grab at it so much like they was going to set a dislocation of the shoulder that you can smell the arnica and hear 'em tearing off bandages. Some take it up like a hot horseshoe, and hold it off at arm's length like a druggist pouring tincture of asafoetida in a bottle. And most of 'em catch hold of it and drag it right out before the lady's eyes like a boy finding a baseball in the grass, without giving her a chance to forget that the hand is growing on the end of her arm. Them ways are all wrong.     "I'll tell you the right way. Did you ever see a man sneak out in the back yard and pick up a rock to throw at a tomcat that was sitting on a fence looking at him? He pretends he hasn't got a thing in his hand, and that the cat don't see him, and that he don't see the cat. That's the idea. Never drag her hand out where she'll have to take notice of it. Don't let her know that you think she knows you have the least idea she is aware you are holding her hand. That was my rule of tactics; and as far as Paisley's serenade about hostilities and misadventure went, he might as well have been reading to her a time- table of the Sunday trains that stop at Ocean Grove, New Jersey.  "One night when I beat Paisley to the bench by one pipeful, my friendship gets subsidised for a minute, and I asks Mrs. Jessup if she didn't think a 'H' was easier to write than a 'J.' In a second her head was mashing the oleander flower in my button-hole, and I leaned over and--but I didn't.  "'If you don't mind,' says I, standing up, 'we'll wait for Paisley to come before finishing this. I've never done anything dishonourable yet to our friendship, and this won't be quite fair.'  "'Mr. Hicks,' says Mrs. Jessup, looking at me peculiar in the dark, 'if it wasn't for but one thing, I'd ask you to hike yourself down the gulch and never disresume your visits to my house.'  "'And what is that, ma'am?' I asks.  "'You are too good a friend not to make a good husband,' says she.  "In five minutes Paisley was on his side of Mrs. Jessup.  "'In Silver City, in the summer of '98,' he begins, 'I see Jim Batholomew chew off a Chinaman's ear in the Blue Light Saloon on account of a crossbarred muslin shirt that--what was that noise?'  "I had resumed matters again with Mrs. Jessup right where we had left off.  "'Mrs. Jessup,' says I, 'has promised to make it Hicks. And this is another of the same sort.'  "Paisley winds his feet round a leg of the bench and kind of groans.  "'Lem,' says he, 'we been friends for seven years. Would you mind not kissing Mrs. Jessup quite so loud? I'd do the same for you.'  "'All right,' says I. 'The other kind will do as well.'  "'This Chinaman,' goes on Paisley, 'was the one that shot a man named Mullins in the spring of '97, and that was--'  "Paisley interrupted himself again.  "'Lem,' says he, 'if you was a true friend you wouldn't hug Mrs. Jessup quite so hard. I felt the bench shake all over just then. You know you told me you would give me an even chance as long as there was any.'  "'Mr. Man,' says Mrs. Jessup, turning around to Paisley, 'if you was to drop in to the celebration of mine and Mr. Hicks's silver wedding, twenty-five years from now, do you think you could get it into that Hubbard squash you call your head that you are /nix cum rous/ in this business? I've put up with you a long time because you was Mr. Hicks's friend; but it seems to me it's time for you to wear the willow and trot off down the hill.'     "'Mrs. Jessup,' says I, without losing my grasp on the situation as fiance, 'Mr. Paisley is my friend, and I offered him a square deal and a equal opportunity as long as there was a chance.'  "'A chance!' says she. 'Well, he may think he has a chance; but I hope he won't think he's got a cinch, after what he's been next to all the evening.'  "Well, a month afterwards me and Mrs. Jessup was married in the Los Pinos Methodist Church; and the whole town closed up to see the performance.  "When we lined up in front and the preacher was beginning to sing out his rituals and observances, I looks around and misses Paisley. I calls time on the preacher. 'Paisley ain't here,' says I. 'We've got to wait for Paisley. A friend once, a friend always--that's Telemachus Hicks,' says I. Mrs. Jessup's eyes snapped some; but the preacher holds up the incantations according to instructions.  "In a few minutes Paisley gallops up the aisle, putting on a cuff as he comes. He explains that the only dry-goods store in town was closed for the wedding, and he couldn't get the kind of a boiled shirt that his taste called for until he had broke open the back window of the store and helped himself. Then he ranges up on the other side of the bride, and the wedding goes on. I always imagined that Paisley calculated as a last chance that the preacher might marry him to the widow by mistake.  "After the proceedings was over we had tea and jerked antelope and canned apricots, and then the populace hiked itself away. Last of all Paisley shook me by the hand and told me I'd acted square and on the level with him and he was proud to call me a friend.  "The preacher had a small house on the side of the street that he'd fixed up to rent; and he allowed me and Mrs. Hicks to occupy it till the ten-forty train the next morning, when we was going on a bridal tour to El Paso. His wife had decorated it all up with hollyhocks and poison ivy, and it looked real festal and bowery.  "About ten o'clock that night I sets down in the front door and pulls off my boots a while in the cool breeze, while Mrs. Hicks was fixing around in the room. Right soon the light went out inside; and I sat there a while reverberating over old times and scenes. And then I heard Mrs. Hicks call out, 'Ain't you coming in soon, Lem?'  "'Well, well!' says I, kind of rousing up. 'Durn me if I wasn't waiting for old Paisley to--'  "But when I got that far," concluded Telemachus Hicks, "I thought somebody had shot this left ear of mine off with a forty-five. But it turned out to be only a lick from a broomhandle in the hands of Mrs. Hicks."
Mr. Towers Chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom. One iron was heating on a small gas stove; the other was being pushed vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in straight lines from Mr. Chandler's patent leather shoes to the edge of his low-cut vest. So much of the hero's toilet may be intrusted to our confidence. The remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient. Our next view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging-house immaculately and correctly clothed; calm, assured, handsome—in appearance the typical New York young clubman setting out, slightly bored, to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening.  Chandler's honorarium was $18 per week. He was employed in the office of an architect. He was twenty-two years old; he considered architecture to be truly an art; and he honestly believed—though he would not have dared to admit it in New York—that the Flatiron Building was inferior to design to the great cathedral in Milan.  Out of each week's earnings Chandler set aside $1. At the end of each ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated, he purchased one gentleman's evening from the bargain counter of stingy old Father Time. He arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents; he took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest, and there dined with taste and luxury. With ten dollars a man may, for a few hours, play the wealthy idler to perfection. The sum is ample for a well-considered meal, a bottle bearing a respectable label, commensurate tips, a smoke, cab fare and the ordinary etceteras.  This one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to Chandler a source of renascent bliss. To the society bud comes but one début; it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened; but to Chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen, as thrilling, as new as the first had been. To sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of concealed music, to look upon the habitués of such a paradise and to be looked upon by them—what is a girl's first dance and short-sleeved tulle compared with this?  Up Broadway Chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade. For this evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer. For the next sixty-nine evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious table d'hôtes, at whirlwind lunch counters, on sandwiches and beer in his hall-bedroom. He was willing to do that, for he was a true son of the great city of razzle-dazzle, and to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones.  Chandler protracted his walk until the Forties began to intersect the great and glittering primrose way, for the evening was yet young, and when one is of the beau monde only one day in seventy, one loves to protract the pleasure. Eyes bright, sinister, curious, admiring, provocative, alluring were bent upon him, for his garb and air proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure.  At a certain corner he came to a standstill, proposing to himself the question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury. Just then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner, slipped on a patch of icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk.  Chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy. The girl hobbled to the wall of the building, leaned against it, and thanked him demurely.  "I think my ankle is strained," she said. "It twisted when I fell."  "Does it pain you much?" inquired Chandler.  "Only when I rest my weight upon it. I think I will be able to walk in a minute or two."  "If I can be of any further service," suggested the young man, "I will call a cab, or—"  "Thank you," said the girl, softly but heartily. "I am sure you need not trouble yourself any further. It was so awkward of me. And my shoe heels are horridly common-sense; I can't blame them at all."  Chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest. She was pretty in a refined way; and her eye was both merry and kind. She was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a sort of uniform such as shop girls wear. Her glossy dark-brown hair showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament was a velvet ribbon and bow. She could have posed as a model for the self-respecting working girl of the best type.  A sudden idea came into the head of the young architect. He would ask this girl to dine with him. Here was the element that his splendid but solitary periodic feasts had lacked. His brief season of elegant luxury would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady's society. This girl was a lady, he was sure—her manner and speech settled that. And in spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to sit at table with her.  These thoughts passed swiftly through his mind, and he decided to ask her. It was a breach of etiquette, of course, but oftentimes wage-earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind. They were generally shrewd judges of men; and thought better of their own judgment than they did of useless conventions. His ten dollars, discreetly expended, would enable the two to dine very well indeed. The dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull routine of the girl's life; and her lively appreciation of it would add to his own triumph and pleasure.  "I think," he said to her, with frank gravity, "that your foot needs a longer rest than you suppose. Now, I am going to suggest a way in which you can give it that and at the same time do me a favour. I was on my way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the corner. You come with me and we'll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant talk together, and by that time your game ankle will carry you home very nicely, I am sure."  The girl looked quickly up into Chandler's clear, pleasant countenance. Her eyes twinkled once very brightly, and then she smiled ingenuously.  "But we don't know each other—it wouldn't be right, would it?" she said, doubtfully.  "There is nothing wrong about it," said the young man, candidly. "I'll introduce myself—permit me—Mr. Towers Chandler. After our dinner, which I will try to make as pleasant as possible, I will bid you good-evening, or attend you safely to your door, whichever you prefer."  "But, dear me!" said the girl, with a glance at Chandler's faultless attire. "In this old dress and hat!"  "Never mind that," said Chandler, cheerfully. "I'm sure you look more charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner toilette."  "My ankle does hurt yet," admitted the girl, attempting a limping step. "I think I will accept your invitation, Mr. Chandler. You may call me—Miss Marian."  "Come then, Miss Marian," said the young architect, gaily, but with perfect courtesy; "you will not have far to walk. There is a very respectable and good restaurant in the next block. You will have to lean on my arm—so—and walk slowly. It is lonely dining all by one's self. I'm just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice."  When the two were established at a well-appointed table, with a promising waiter hovering in attendance, Chandler began to experience the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him.  The restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down Broadway, which he always preferred, but it was nearly so. The tables were well filled with prosperous-looking diners, there was a good orchestra, playing softly enough to make conversation a possible pleasure, and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism. His companion, even in her cheap hat and dress, held herself with an air that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure. And it is certain that she looked at Chandler, with his animated but self-possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes, with something not far from admiration in her own charming face.  Then it was that the Madness of Manhattan, the frenzy of Fuss and Feathers, the Bacillus of Brag, the Provincial Plague of Pose seized upon Towers Chandler. He was on Broadway, surrounded by pomp and style, and there were eyes to look at him. On the stage of that comedy he had assumed to play the one-night part of a butterfly of fashion and an idler of means and taste. He was dressed for the part, and all his good angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it.  So he began to prate to Miss Marian of clubs, of teas, of golf and riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints of a yacht lying at Larchmont. He could see that she was vastly impressed by this vague talk, so he endorsed his pose by random insinuations concerning great wealth, and mentioned familiarly a few names that are handled reverently by the proletariat. It was Chandler's short little day, and he was wringing from it the best that could be had, as he saw it. And yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and all objects.  "This way of living that you speak of," she said, "sounds so futile and purposeless. Haven't you any work to do in the world that might interest you more?"  "My dear Miss Marian," he exclaimed—"work! Think of dressing every day for dinner, of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon—with a policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to the station, if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart's gait. We do-nothings are the hardest workers in the land."  The dinner was concluded, the waiter generously fed, and the two walked out to the corner where they had met. Miss Marian walked very well now; her limp was scarcely noticeable.  "Thank you for a nice time," she said, frankly. "I must run home now. I liked the dinner very much, Mr. Chandler."  He shook hands with her, smiling cordially, and said something about a game of bridge at his club. He watched her for a moment, walking rather rapidly eastward, and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward.  In his chilly bedroom Chandler laid away his evening clothes for a sixty-nine days' rest. He went about it thoughtfully.  "That was a stunning girl," he said to himself. "She's all right, too, I'd be sworn, even if she does have to work. Perhaps if I'd told her the truth instead of all that razzle-dazzle we might—but, confound it! I had to play up to my clothes."  Thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the tribe of the Manhattans.  The girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east, facing on that avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary gods. Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously out the window.  "Oh, you madcap!" exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered. "When will you quit frightening us this way? It is two hours since you ran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie's hat. Mamma has been so alarmed. She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you. You are a bad, thoughtless Puss."  The elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment.  "Marie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned."  "Don't scold, sister. I only ran down to Mme. Theo's to tell her to use mauve insertion instead of pink. My costume and Marie's hat were just what I needed. Every one thought I was a shopgirl, I am sure."  "Dinner is over, dear; you stayed so late."  "I know. I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle. I could not walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better. That is why I was so long."  The two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue. The younger one cuddled down with her head in her sister's lap.  "We will have to marry some day," she said dreamily—"both of us. We have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the public. Do you want me to tell you the kind of a man I could love, Sis?"  "Go on, you scatterbrain," smiled the other.  "I could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes, who is gentle and respectful to poor girls, who is handsome and good and does not try to flirt. But I could love him only if he had an ambition, an object, some work to do in the world. I would not care how poor he was if I could help him build his way up. But, sister dear, the kind of man we always meet—the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs—I could not love a man like that, even if his eyes were blue and he were ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street."
IT WAS A DAY to be out of bed, to pull curtains and fling open windows. It was a day to make your heart bigger. It was early, the sun barely on the horizon, but already the birds were stirring from the pines and ten billion red ants milled free from their bronze hills by the cabin door. Cora’s husband Tom slept like a bear in a snowyhibernation of bedclothes beside her. Will my heart wake him up? she wondered.  And then she knew why this seemed a special day.  “Benjy’s coming!”  She imagined him far off, fording streams where spring was pushing itself in cool colors of moss and clear water toward the sea. She saw his great shoes dusting and flicking the stony roads and paths. She saw his freckled face. “Benjy, come on!” she thought, opening a window swiftly. Wind blew her hair like a grey spider web about her cold ears . . “Now Benjy’s at Iron Bridge, now at Meadow Pike, now up Creek Path, over Chesley’s Field . . .”  Somewhere in the mountains was Benjy. Cora blinked. Those strange high hills beyond which twice a year she and Tom drove their horse and wagon to town, and through which she had once wanted to run forever, saying, “O, Tom, let’s just drive and drive until we reach the sea.” But Tom had looked at her as if she had slapped his face, and he had turned the wagon around and driven on home, talking to the mare. And if people lived by shores where the sea came like a storm, now louder, now softer, every day, she did not know it. And if there were cities where neons  were like pink ice and green mint and red fireworks each evening, she didn’t know that either. Her horizon, north, south, east, west, was this valley, and had never been anything else.  “But now, today,” she thought, “Benjy’s coming from that world out there, he’s seen it, heard it, smelt it, he’ll tell me about it. And he can write.” She looked at her hands. “He’ll be here a whole month and teach me. Then I can write out into that world and bring it here to the mailbox I’ll make Tom build today. Get up, Tom! You hear?”  She put her hand out to push the bank of sleeping snow.  By nine o’clock the valley was full of grasshoppers flinging themselves through the blue piney air while smoke curled into the sky.  Cora, singing into her pots and pans as she polished them, saw her face bronzed and freshened in the copper bottoms. Tom was grumbling the sounds of a sleepy bear at his breakfast, while her singing moved all about him. like a bird in a cage.  "Someone’s mighty happy,” said a voice.  Cora made herself into a statue. From the comers of her eyes she saw a shadow cross the open door. "Mrs. Brabham?” asked Cora of her scouring cloth.  "That’s who it is!” And there stood the widow woman, her gingham dress dragging the warm dust, her letters in her chickeny hand. "Morning! I just been to my mailbox. Got me a real beauty of a letter from my Uncle George.” Mrs. Brabham fixed Cora with a gaze like a silver needle. “How long since you got a letter from your uncle, Missus?”  "My uncles are all dead.” It was not Cora  herself, but her tongue, that lied. When the time came, she knew, it would be her tongue alone that must take communion and confess earthly sinning.  “It’s certainly nice, getting mail.” Mrs. Brabham waved her letters in a straight flush on the morning air.  Always twisting the knife in the flesh. How many years, thought Cora, had this run on, Mrs. Brabham and her smily eyes, talking loud of how she got mail: inferring that nobody else for miles around could read. Cora bit her lip and almost threw the pot, but set it down, laughing. “I forgot to tell you. My nephew Benjy’s coming; his folks are poorly, and he’s here for the summer, today! He’ll teach me to write. And Tom’s building us a postal box, aren’t you, Tom?”  Mrs. Brabham clutched her letters. “Well, isn’t that fine? You lucky lady.” And suddenly the door was empty. Mrs. Brabham was gone.  But Cora was after her. For in that instant she had seen something like a scarecrow, something like a flicker of pure sunlight, something like a brook trout jumping upstream, leap a fence in the yard below. She saw a huge wand wave and birds flush in terror from a crab-apple tree. Cora was rushing, the world rushing back of her, down the path. “Benjy!”  They ran at each other like partners in a Saturday dance, linked arms, collided, and waltzed, jabbering.  “Benjy!”  She glanced swiftly behind his ear. Yes, there was the yellow pencil.  “Benjy, welcome!”  “Why, ma’am.” He held  Continued on page 22  Continued from page 14  her off at arm’s length. “Why, ma’am, you’re crying.”  HERE’S my nephew,” said Cora.  Tom scowled up from spooning his corn-meal mush.  “Mighty glad,” smiled Benjy.  Cora held his arm tight so he couldn’t vanish. She felt faint, wanting to sit, stand, run, but she only beat her heart fast and laughed at strange times. Now. in an instant, the far countries were brought near. Here was this tall boy, lighting up the room like a pine torch, this boy who had seen cities and seas and gone places when things had been better for his parents.  “Benjy, I got peas, corn, bacon, mush, soup, and beans for breakfast.” “Hold on!” said Tom.  “Hush. Tom. the boy’s down to the bone with walking.” She turned to the boy. “Benjy, tell me all about yourself. You did go to school?” Benjy kicked off his shoes. With one bare foot he traced a word in the hearth ashes.  Tom scowled. “What’s it say?”  “It says,” said Benjy, “C and O and R and A. Cora.”  “My name. Tom, see it! Oh. Benjy, it’s good you really write, child. We had one cousin here, long ago, claimed he could spell upside down and backwards. So we fattened him up and he wrote letters and we never got answers. Come to find out he knew just enough spelling to mail letters to the dead-letter office. Lord, Tom knocked two months’ worth of vittles out of that boy batting him up the road with a piece of fence.” They laughed, anxiously.  “I write fine,” said the serious boy. “That’s all we want to know.” She shoved a cut of berry pie at him. “Eat.”  By ten-thirty, with the sun riding higher, after watching Benjy devour heaped platters of food, Tom thundered from the cabin, jamming his cap on. “I’m going out and cut down half the forest!” he said angrily.  But no one heard. Cora was seated in a breathless spell. She was watching the pencil behind Benjy’s peach-fuzz ear. She saw him finger it casually, lazily, indifferently. Oh, not so casual, Benjy, she thought, handle it like a spring robin’s egg. She wanted to touch the pencil, but hadn’t touched one in years because it made her feel foolish and then angry and then sad. Her hand twitched in her lap.  “You got some paper?” asked Benjy. “Oh, land, I never thought,” she wailed, and the room walls darkened. “What’ll we do?”  “Just happens I brought some.” He fetched a tablet from his little bag. “You want to write a letter somewhere?”  She smiled outrageously. “I want to write a letter to . . . to . Her face fell apart. She looked around for someone in the distance. She looked at the mountains in the morning sunshine. She heard the sea rolling off on yellow shores a thousand miles away. The birds were coming north over the valley, on their way to multitudes of cities and indifferent to her need.  “Benjy, why, I never thought, until this moment. I don’t know anybody in all that world out there. Nobody but my aunt. And if I wrote her it’d make her feel bad, a hundred miles from here, to have to find someone else to read the letter to her. She’s got the whalebone corset sort of pride. Make her nervous the next ten years, that letter setting in her house on the mantel. No, no letter to her.” Cora’s  eyes moved from the hills and the unseen ocean. “Who then? Where? Someone. I just’ve got to get me some letters.”  “Hold on.” Benjy fished a dime magazine from his coat. It had a red cover of an undressed woman screaming away from a green monster. “All sorts of addresses in here.”  They leafed the pages together. “What’s this?” Cora tapped an ad.  “HERE’S YOUR Power Plus FREE MUSCLE CHART. Send name, address,” read Benjy. “To Dept. M-3 for Free Health Map!”  “And what about this one?” “DETECTIVES MAKE SECRET INVESTIGATIONS. PARTICULARS FREE. WRITE: G.D.M. DETECTIVE SCHOOL—.”  “Everything’s free. Well, Benjy.” She lookedat the pencil in his hand. He drew up his chair. She watched him turn the pencil in his fingers. She saw him bite his tongue, softly. She saw him squint his eyes. She held her breath. She bent forward. She squinted her own eyes and clamped her tongue.  Now, now Benjy raised his pencil, licked it, and set it down to the paper. “There it is!” thought Cora.  The first words. They formed themselves slowly on the incredible paper. “Dear Power Plus Muscle Company. Sirs,” he wrote.  THE morning blew away on a wind, the morning flowed down the creek, the morning flew off with some ravens, and the sun burned on the cabin roof. Cora didn’t turn when she heard a shuffle at the blazing sun-filled door. Tom was there, but not there, nothing was before her but a series of filled pages, a whispering pencil, and Benjy’s careful Palmer Penmanship hand. Cora moved her head around, around, with each O, each L, with each small hill of an M, each tiny dot made her head peck like a chicken, each crossed T made her tongue lick across her upper lip.  “It’s noon and I’m hungry!” said Tom, almost behind her.  But Cora was a statue now, watching the pencil as one watches a snail leaving an exceptional trail across a flat stone in the early morning.  “It’s noon!” cried Tom, again. Cora glanced up, stunned. "Why, it seems only a moment ago we wrote to that Philadelphia Coin Collecting Company, ain’t that right. Benjy?” Cora smiled c dazzling smile. “While you wait for your vittles, Tom, just can’t you build that mailbox? Bigger than Mrs. Brabbam’s, please?”  “I’ll nail up a shoebox.”  “Tom Gibbs.” She rose pleasantly. Her smile said, better run. better work, better do. “I want a big pretty mailbox, all white, for Benjy to paint our name on in black spelling. I won’t have any shoebox for my very first real letter.” And it was done.  Benjy lettered the finished mailbox: MRS. CORA GIBBS, while Tom stood grumbling behind him. “What’s it say?” "MR. TOM GIBBS,” said Be¿jy, quietly, painting.  Tom blinked at it for a minute, quietly, and then said, “I’m still hungry. Someone light the fire.” There were no stamps. Tom was made to hitch up the horse and drive to Green Fork to buy some red ones, a green, and ten pink stamps with dignified gentlemen printed on them. But Cora rode along to be certain Tom didn’t hurl these first letters in the creek. When they rode home the first thing Cora did, face glowing, was poke in the new mailbox.  “You crazy?” said Tom.  “No harm looking.”  That afternoon she visited the mailbox six times. On the seventh, a  woodchuck jumped out. Tom stood laughing in the door, pounding his knees. Cora chased him out of the house still laughing.  Then she stood in the window looking down at her mailbox right across from Mrs. Brabham’s. Ten years ago the widow woman had plunked her letterbox right under Cora’s nose almost, when she could as easily have built it up nearer her own cabin. But it gave Mrs. Brabham an excuse to float like a flower on a river, down the hill path, flip the box wide with a great rustling, from time to time spying up to see if Cora was watching. Cora always was. When caught, she pretended to sprinkle flowers with an empty water can, or dig mushrooms in the wrong season.  NEXT morning Cora was up before the sun had warmed the strawberry patch or the wind had stirred the pines.  Benjy was sitting up in his cot when Cora returned from the mailbox. “Too early,” he said. “Postman won’t drive by yet.”  “Drive by?”  “They come in cars, this far out.” “Oh.” Cora sat down.  “You sick, Aunt Cora?”  “No, no.” She blinked. “It’s just, I don’t recall in twenty years seeing no mail truck whistle by here. It just came to me. All this time I never seen no mailman at all.”  “Maybe he comes when you’re not around.”  “I’m up with the fog-spunks, down with the chickens. I never really gave it a thought, of course, but—.” She turned to look out the window, up at Mrs. Brabham’s house. “Benjy, I got a kind of sneaking hunch.” She stood up and walked straight out of the cabin, down the dust path, Benjy following, across the thin road to Mrs. Brabham’s mailbox. A hush was on the fields and lulls. It was so early it made you whisper.  “Don’t break the law, Aunt Cora!” “Shh. Here.” She opened the box, put her hand in like someone fumbling in a gopher hole. “And here, and here.” She rattled some letters into his cupped hands.  “Why, these been opened already! You open these, Aunt Cora?”  “I never touched them.” Her face was stunned. “This is the first time in my life I ever even let my shadow cross this box.”  Benjy turned the letters around and around, cocking his head. “Why, Aunt Cora, these letters, they’re ten years old!”  “What!” Cora grabbed at them. “Aunt Cora, she's been getting the same mail every day for years. And they’re not even addressed to Mrs. Brabham, they’re to some woman named Ortega in Green Fork.”  “Ortega, the Mexican grocery woman! All these years,” whispered Cora, staring at the worn mail in her hands. “All these years.”  They gazed up at Mrs. Brabham’s sleeping house in the cool quiet morning.  “Oh, that sly woman, making a commotion with her letters, making me feel small. All puffed out she was, swishing along, reading her mail.” Mrs. Brabbam's front door opened. “Put them back, Aunt Cora!”  Cora slammed the mailbox shut with time to spare.  Mrs. Brabham drifted down the path, stopping here or there, quietly, to peer at the opening wild flowers. “Morning,” she said, sweetly.  “Mrs. Brabham, this is my nephew Benjy.”  “How nice.” Mrs. Brabham with a great swivel of her body, a flourish of her flour-white hands, rapped the mail-  bos as if to shake the letters loose inside, flipped the lid, and extracted the mail, covering her actions with her back. She made motions, and spun about, merrily, winking. “Wonderful! Why just look at this letter from dear Uncle George!”  “Well, ain’t that nice!” said Cora.  THEN the breathless summer days of waiting. The butterflies jumping orange and blue on the air, the flowers nodding about the cabin, and the hard constant sound of Benjy’s pencil scribbling through the afternoons. Benjy’s mouth was always packed with food and Tom was always stomping in to find lunch or supper late, cold, both, or none at all.  Benjy handled the pencil with a delicious spread of his bony hands, lovingly inscribing each vowel and consonant as Cora hovered about him making up words, rolling them on her tongue, delighted each time she saw them spring out on the paper. But she wasn’t learning to write. “It’s so much fun watrhing you write, Benjy. Tomorrow I’ll start learning. Now take another letter!”  They worked their way through ads about Asthma, Trusses, and Magic, they joined the Rosicrucians. or at least sent for a free sealed book all about the Knowledge that Had been Damned to Oblivion, Secrets from Hidden Ancient Temples and Buried Sanctuaries. Then there were free packets of Giant Sunflower seeds, and something about HEARTBURN. They had worked back to page 127 of Quarter Murder Magazine, on a bright summer morning when . . .  “Listen,” said Cora.  They Listened.  “A car.” said Benjy.  I And up the blue hills and through the tall fiery green pines and along the dusty road, mile by mile, came the sound of a car riding along and along, until finally, at the bend, it came full thundering and in an instant Cora was out the door running and as she ran she heard and saw and felt many things. First, from the comer of her eye, she saw Mrs. Brabham gliding down the road from the other direction. Mrs. Brabham froze when she saw the bright green car boiling on the grade, and there was the whistle of a silver whistle and the old man in the car leaned out just before Cora arrived and said. "Mrs. Gibbs?” "Ves!" she cried. "Mail for you, ma'am," he said, and held it toward her. She put out her hand, then drew back, remembering. "Oh.” she said, "please, would you mind, would you put it. please . . . in my mailbox.” The old man squinted at her. at the mailbox, back at her, and laughed. "Don’t mind.” he said, and did just that put the mail in the box.  Mrs. Brabham stood where she was. not moving, eyes wild. "Any mail for Mrs. Brabham?" asked Cora.  "That’s all." And the car dusted away down the road.  Mrs. Brabham stood with her hands clenched together. Then, without looking in her own letterbox, turned and rustled swiftly up her path, out of sight.  Cora walked around her mailbox twice, not touching it for a long time. "Benjy. I’ve gor me some letters!" She reached in. delicately, and took them out and turned them over. She put them quietly in his hand. "Read them to me. Is my name on the front?” "Yes’m." He opened the first letter with due carefulness and read it aloud in the summer morning: "Dear Mrs. Gibbs . . .”  He stopped and let her savor it. her 1 eyes half shut, her mouth moving the words. He repeated it for artistic  emphasis, and then went on: “We are sending you our free folder, enclosed, from the Intercontinental Mailing Schools concerning full particulars on how you, too, can take our Correspondence Course in Sanitary Engineering—.”  “Benjy, Benjy, I’m so happy! Start over again!”  “Dear Mrs. Gibbs,” he read.  AFTER that the mailbox was never empty. The world came rushing and crowding in, all the places she had never seen or heard about or been to. Travel folders, spice cake recipes, and even a letter from an elderly gentleman who wished for „ lady “—fifty years old, gentle disposition, money; object matrimony.” Benjy wrote back, “I am already married, but thank you for your kind and thoughtful consideration. Yours truly. Cora Gibbs.” And the letters continued to pour across the hills: coin collectors’ catalogues, novelty books, magic list numbers, arthritis charts, flea killer samples—the world filled up her letterbox and suddenly she was not alone or remote from people. If a man wrote a form letter to Cora about the Mysteries of Ancient Maya Revealed, he was likely as not to receive three letters from Cora in the next week budding out their formal meeting into a warm friendship. After one particularly hard day of writing Benjy was forced to soak his hand in Epsom salts.  By the end of the third week Mrs. Brabham no longer came down to her mailbox. She didn’t even come out the front door of her cabin to get the air, for Cora was always down at the road, leaning out, smiling for the  All too quickly the Stimmer was at an end. or, at least, that part of the summer that counted most, anyway: Benjy’s visit. There was his red bandanna handkerchief on the cabin table, sandwiches folded fresh and oniony in it, tied with a mint-sprig to keep it clean to the smell; there on the floor, freshly polished, were his shoes to get in to, and there on the chair, with his pencil, which had once been long and yellow but was now stubby and chewed, sat Benjy. Cora took hold of his chin and tilted his head, as if she were testing a summer squash of an unfamiliar variety.  "Benjy, I owe you an apology. I don’t think I looked at your face once in all this time. Seems I know every wart on your hand, every hangnail, every bump and every crinkle, but I might pass your face in a crowd and miss you.”  "It’s no face to look at,” said Benjy, shyly.  "But I'd know that hand in a million hands,” Cora said. “Let anyone shake my hand in a dark room, a thousand people, and out of all those I'd say. Well, this one's Benjy.” She  smiled quietly and walked away to the open door. “I been thinking.” She looked up at a distant cabin. “Ain’t seen Mrs. Brabham in weeks. Stays in all the time now. I’ve got a guilty feeling. I’ve done a prideful thing, a thing more sinful than she ever done me. I took the bottom out of her life. It was a mean and spiteful thing and I’m ashamed.” She gazed up the hill toward that silent locked place. “Benjy, would you do me one last favor?”  “Write a letter for Mrs. Brabham.”  “Ma’am?”  “Yes, write some of those companies, a free chart, a sample, something, and sign Mrs. Brabham’s name.”  “All right,” said Benjy.  “Thi t way in A week or a month the postman’ll come by and whistle and I’ll tell him to go up to her door, special, and deliver it. And I’ll be sure and be out in my front yard where I can see and Mrs. Brabham can see I see. And I’ll wave my letters to her and she’ll wave her letters to me and everybody'll smile.”  “Yes’m.” said Benjy.  He wrote three letters, licked tire envelopes carefully, stuck them in his pocket. “I’ll mail them when I get to Saint Louis.”  “It’s been a fine summer,” she said.  “It sure lias.”  “But, Benjy, I didn't learn to write, did I? I was after the letters and made you write late nights, and we were so busy sending labels and getting samples, land, it seemed there wnsn’t time to learn. And that means . .”  He knew what it meant. He shook her hand. They stood in the cabin door. “Thanks,” she said, “for every-  ihen he was running off. He ran as far as the meadow fence, leaped it easily, and the last she saw of him he was still running, waving the special l“tters. off into the great world over tile hills.  THE letters kept coming for some six months after Benjy went away. There would be the postman’s little green car and the sharp ice-rimed shout of good morning, or the whistle, as he clapped two or three pink or blue envelopes in that fine mailbox.  And there was that special day when Mrs. Brabham received her first real letter.  After that the letters were spaced a week apart, then a month, and finally the postman didn’t say hello at all. there was no sound of a car coming up that lonely mountain road. First a spider moved into the mailbox, then a sparrow.  And Cora, while the letters still lasted, would clutch them in her bewildered hands, staring at them quietly until the pressure of her face muscles squeezed clear round shiny , drops of water from her eves. She’d hold up one blue envelope. “Who’s this from?"  "Don't know.” said Tom.  “What’s it say?” she wailed.  “Don’t know.” said Torr.  “What’s going on in that world out there, oh. I’ll never know. I'll never know now.” she said. “And this letter, and this one, and this." She tumbled the stacks and stacks of letters that had come since Benjy ran off. “All the world and all the people and all the happenings, and me not knowing All that world and people waiting to hear from us. and us not writing, and them not ever writing back!"  And at last the day came when the wind blew the mailbox over. In the mornings again Cora would stand at the open door of her cabin brushing her hair with a slow brush, not spealing. looking at the hills. And in all the years that followed she never passed the fallen mailbox without stooping aimlessly to fumble inside and take her hand out with nothing in it before she wandered on again into the fields.
THE rain continued. It was a hard rain, a perpetual rain, a sweating and steaming rain; it was a mizzle, a downpour, a fountain, a whipping at the eyes, an undertow at the ankles; it was a rain to drown all rains and the memory of rains. It came by the pound and the ton, it hacked at the jungle and cut the trees like scissors and shaved the grass and tunneled the soil and molted the bushes. It shrank men’s hands into the hands of wrinkled apes; it rained a solid glassy rain, and it never stopped. “How much farther, Lieutenant?” “I don’t know. A mile, ten miles, a thousand.” “Aren’t you sure?” “How can I be sure?” “I don’t like this rain. If we only knew how far it is to the Sun Dome, I’d feel better.” “Another hour or two from here.” “You really think so, Lieutenant?” “Of course.” “Or are you lying to keep us happy?” “I’m lying to keep you happy. Shut up!” The two men sat together in the rain. Behind them sat two other men who were wet and tired and slumped like clay that was melting. The lieutenant looked up. He had a face that once had been brown and now the rain had washed it pale, and the rain had washed the color from his eyes and they were white, as were his teeth, and as was his hair. He was all white. Even his uniform was beginning to turn white, and perhaps a little green with fungus. “Don’t be crazy,” said one of the two other men. “It never stops raining on Venus. It just goes on and on. I’ve lived here for ten years and I never saw a minute, or even a second, when it wasn’t pouring.” “It’s like living under water,” said the lieutenant, and rose up, shrugging his guns into place. “Well, we’d better get going. We’ll find that Sun Dome yet.” “Or we won’t find it,” said the cynic. “It’s an hour or so.” “Now you’re lying to me, Lieutenant.”  “No, now I’m lying to myself. This is one of those times when you’ve got to lie. I can’t take much more of this.” They walked down the jungle trail, now and then looking at their compasses. There was no direction anywhere, only what the compass said. There was a gray sky and rain falling and jungle and a path, and, far back behind them somewhere, a rocket in which they had ridden and fallen. A rocket in which lay two of their friends, dead and dripping rain. They walked in single file, not speaking. They came to a river which lay wide and flat and brown, flowing down to the great Single Sea. The surface of it was stippled in a billion places by the rain. “All right, Simmons.” The lieutenant nodded and Simmons took a small packet from his back which, with a pressure of hidden chemical, inflated into a large boat. The lieutenant directed the cutting of wood and the quick making of paddles and they set out into the river, paddling swiftly across the smooth surface in the rain. The lieutenant felt the cold rain on his cheeks and on his neck and on his moving arms. The cold was beginning to seep into his lungs. He felt the rain on his ears, on his eyes, on his legs. “I didn’t sleep last night,” he said. “Who could? Who has? When? How many nights have we slept? Thirty nights, thirty days! Who can sleep with rain slamming their head, banging away. . . . I’d give anything for a hat. Anything at all, just so it wouldn’t hit my head any more. I get headaches. My head is sore; it hurts all the time.” “I’m sorry I came to China,” said one of the others. “First time I ever heard Venus called China.” “Sure, China. Chinese water cure. Remember the old torture? Rope you against a wall. Drop one drop of water on your head every half-hour. You go crazy waiting for the next one. Well, that’s Venus, but on a big scale. We’re not made for water. You can’t sleep, you can’t breathe right, and you’re crazy from just being soggy. If we’d been ready for a crash, we’d have brought waterproofed uniforms and hats. It’s this beating rain on your head gets you, most of all. It’s so heavy. It’s like BB shot. I don’t know how long I can take it.” They crossed the river, and in crossing they thought of the Sun Dome, somewhere ahead of them, shining in the jungle rain. A yellow house, round and bright as the sun. A house fifteen feet high by one hundred feet in diameter, in which was warmth and quiet and hot food and freedom from rain. And in the center of the Sun Dome, of course, was a sun. A small floating free globe of yellow fire, drifting in space at the top of the building where you could look at it from where you sat, smoking or reading a book or drinking your hot chocolate crowned with marshmallow dollops. There it would be, the yellow sun, just the size of the Earth sun, and it was warm and continuous, and the rain world of Venus would be forgotten as long as they stayed in that house and idled their time. The lieutenant turned and looked back at the three men using their oars and gritting their teeth. They were as white as mushrooms, as white as lie was. Venus bleached everything away in a few months. Even the jungle was an immense cartoon nightmare, for how could the jungle be green with no sun,   with always rain falling and always dusk? The white, white jungle with the pale cheese-colored leaves, and the earth carved of wet Camembert, and the tree boles like immense toadstools— everything black and white. And how often could you see the soil itself? Wasn’t it mostly a creek, a stream, a puddle, a pool, a lake, a river, and then, at last the sea? “Here we are!” They leaped out on the farthest shore, splashing and sending up showers. The boat was deflated and stored in a cigarette packet. Then, standing on the rainy shore, they tried to light up a few smokes for themselves, and it was five minutes or so before, shuddering, they worked the inverted lighter and, cupping their hands, managed a few drags upon cigarettes that all too quickly were limp and beaten away from their lips by a sudden slap of rain. They walked on. “Wait just a moment,” said the lieutenant. “I thought I saw something ahead.” “The Sun Dome?” “I’m not sure. The rain closed in again. Simmons began to run. “The Sun Dome!” “Come back, Simmons!” “The Sun Dome!” Simmons vanished in the rain. The others ran after him. They found him in a little clearing, and they stopped and looked at him and what he had discovered. The rocket ship. It was lying where they had left it. Somehow they had circled back and were where they had started. In the ruin of the ship green fungus was growing up out of the mouths of the two dead men. As they watched, the fungus took flower, the petals broke away in the rain, and the fungus died. “An electrical storm must be nearby. Threw our compasses off. That explains it.” “You’re right.” “What’ll we do now?” “Start out again.” “Good lord, we’re not any closer to anywhere!” “Let’s try to keep calm about it, Simmons.” “Calm, calm! This rain’s driving me wild!” “We’ve enough food for another two days if we’re careful.”  The rain danced on their skin, on their wet uniforms; the rain streamed from their noses and ears, from their fingers and knees. They looked like stone fountains frozen in the jungle, issuing forth water from every pore. And, as they stood, from a distance they heard a roar. And the monster came out of the rain. The monster was supported upon a thousand electric blue legs. It walked swiftly and terribly. It struck down a leg with a driving blow. Everywhere a leg struck a tree fell and burned. Great whiffs of ozone filled the rainy air, and smoke blew away and was broken up by the rain. The monster was a half mile wide and a mile high and it felt of the ground like a great blind thing. Sometimes, for a moment, it had no legs at all. And then, in an instant, a thousand whips would fall out of its belly, white-blue whips, to sting the jungle. “There’s the electrical storm,” said one of the men. “There’s the thing ruined our compasses. And it’s coming this way.” “Lie down, everyone,” said the lieutenant. “Run!” cried Simmons. “Don’t be a fool. Lie down. It hits the highest points. We may get through unhurt. Lie down about fifty feet from the rocket. It may very well spend its force there and leave us be. Get down!” The men flopped. “Is it coming?” they asked each other, after a moment. “Coming.” “Is it nearer?” “Is it nearer?” “Nearer?” “Here she is!” The monster came and stood over them. It dropped down ten blue bolts of lightning which struck the rocket. The rocket flashed like a beaten gong and gave off a metal ringing. The monster let down fifteen more bolts which danced about in a ridiculous pantomime, feeling of the jungle and the watery soil. “No, no!” One of the men jumped up. “Get down, yon fool!” said the lieutenant. “No!”  The lightning struck the rocket another dozen times. The lieutenant turned his head on his arm and saw the blue blazing flashes. He saw trees split and crumple into ruin. He saw the monstrous dark cloud turn like a black disk overhead and hurl down a hundred other poles of electricity. The man who had leaped up was now running, like someone in a great hall of pillars. He ran and dodged between the pillars and then at last a dozen of the pillars slammed down and there was the sound a fly makes when landing upon the grill wires of an exterminator. The lieutenant remembered this from his childhood on a farm. And there was a smell of a man burned to a cinder. The lieutenant lowered his head. “Don’t look up,” he told the others. He was afraid that he too might run at any moment. The storm above them flashed down another series of bolts and then moved on away. Once again there was only the rain, which rapidly cleared the air of the charred smell, and in a moment the three remaining men were sitting and waiting for the beat of their hearts to subside into quiet once more. They walked over to the body, thinking that perhaps they could still save the man’s life. They couldn’t believe that there wasn’t some way to help the man. It was the natural act of men who have not accepted death until they have touched it and turned it over and made plans to bury it or leave it there for the jungle to bury in an hour of quick growth. The body was twisted steel, wrapped in burned leather. It looked like a wax dummy that had been thrown into an incinerator and pulled out after the wax had sunk to the charcoal skeleton. Only the teeth were white, and they shone like a strange white bracelet dropped half through a clenched black fist. “He shouldn’t have jumped up.” They said it almost at the same time. Even as they stood over the body it began to vanish, for the vegetation was edging in upon it, little vines and ivy and creepers, and even flowers for the dead. At a distance the storm walked off on blue bolts of lightning and was gone. They crossed a river and a creek and a stream and a dozen other rivers and creeks and streams. Before their eyes rivers appeared, rushing, new rivers, while old rivers changed their courses—rivers the color of mercury, rivers the color of silver and milk. The Single Sea. There was only one continent on Venus. This land was three thousand miles long by a thousand miles wide, and about this island was the Single Sea, which covered the entire raining planet. The Single Sea, which lay upon the pallid shore with little motion . . . “This way.” The lieutenant nodded south. “I’m sure there are two Sun Domes down that way. “While they were at it, why didn’t they build a hundred more?” “There’re a hundred and twenty of them now, aren’t there?” “One hundred and twenty-six, as of last month. They tried to push a bill through Congress back on Earth a year ago to provide for a couple dozen more, but oh no, you know how that is. They’d rather a few men went crazy with the rain.”  They started south. The lieutenant and Simmons and the third man, Pickard, walked in the rain, in the rain that fell heavily and lightly, heavily and lightly; in the rain that poured and hammered and did not stop falling upon the land and the sea and the walking people. Simmons saw it first. “There it is!” “There’s what?” “The Sun Dome!” The lieutenant blinked the water from his eyes and raised his hands to ward off the stinging blows of the rain. At a distance there was a yellow glow on the edge of the jungle, by the sea. It was, indeed, the Sun Dome. The men smiled at each other. “Looks like you were right, Lieutenant.” “Luck.” “Brother, that puts muscle in me, just seeing it. Come on! Last one there’s a son-of-a-bitch!” Simmons began to trot. The others automatically fell in with this, gasping, tired, but keeping pace. “A big pot of coffee for me,” panted Simmons, smiling. “And a pan of cinnamon buns, by God! And just lie there and let the old sun hit you. The guy that invented the Sun Domes, he should have got a medal!” They ran faster. The yellow glow grew brighter. “Guess a lot of men went crazy before they figured out the cure. Think it’d be obvious! Right off.” Simmons panted the words in cadence to his running. “Rain, rain! Years ago. Found a friend. Of min. Out in the jungle. Wandering around. In the rain. Saying over and over, ‘Don’t know enough to come in outta the rain. Don’t know enough, to come in, outta the rain. Don’t know enough –‘ on and on. Like that. Poor crazy bastard.” “Save your breath!” They ran. They all laughed. They reached the door of the Sun Dome, laughing. Simmons yanked the door wide. “Hey!” he yelled. “Bring on the coffee and buns!” There was no reply.  They stepped through the door. The Sun Dome was empty and dark. There was no synthetic yellow sun floating in a high gaseous whisper at the center of the blue ceiling. There was no food waiting. It was cold as a vault. And through a thousand holes which had been newly punctured in the ceiling water streamed, the rain fell down, soaking into the thick rugs and the heavy modern furniture and splashing on the glass tables. The jungle was growing up like a moss in the room, on top of the bookcases and the divans. The rain slashed through the holes and fell upon the three men’s faces. Pickard began to laugh quietly. “Shut up, Pickard!” “Ye gods, look what’s here for us—no food, no sun, nothing. The Venusians—they did it! Of course!” Simmons nodded, with the rain funneling down on his face. The water ran in his silvered hair and on his white eyebrows. “Every once in a while the Venusians come up out of the sea and attack a Sun Dome. They know if they ruin the Sun Domes they can ruin us.” “But aren’t the Sun Domes protected with guns?” “Sure.” Simmons stepped aside to a place that was relatively dry. “But it’s been five years since the Venusians tried anything. Defense relaxes. They caught this Dome unaware.” “Where are the bodies?” “The Venusians took them all down into the sea. I hear they have a delightful way of drowning you. It takes about eight hours to drown the way they work it. Really delightful.” “I bet there isn’t any food here at all.” Pickard laughed. The lieutenant frowned at him, nodded at him so Simmons could see. Simmons shook his head and went back to a room at one side of the oval chamber. The kitchen was strewn with soggy loaves of bread, and meat that had grown a faint green fur. Rain came through a hundred holes in the kitchen roof. “Without food, sir?” Simmons snorted. “I notice the sun machine’s torn apart. Our best bet is to make our way to the next Sun Dome. How far is that from here?” “Not far. As I recall, they built two rather close together here. Perhaps if we waited here, a rescue mission from the other might——” “It’s probably been here and gone already, some days ago. They’ll send a crew to repair this place in about six months, when they get the money from Congress. I don’t think we’d better wait.” “All right then, we’ll eat what’s left of our rations and get on to the next Dome.”  Pickard said, “If only the rain wouldn’t hit my head, just for a few minutes. If I could only remember what it’s like not to be bothered.” He put his hands on his skull and held it tight. “I remember when I was in school a bully used to sit in back of me and pinch me and pinch me and pinch me every five minutes, all day long. He did that for weeks and months. My arms were sore and black and blue all the time. And I thought I’d go crazy from being pinched. One day I must have gone a little mad from being hurt and hurt, and I turned around and took a metal trisquare I used in mechanical drawing and I almost killed that bastard. I almost cut his lousy head off. I almost took his eye out before they dragged me out of the room, and I kept yelling, ‘Why don’t he leave me alone? why don’t he leave me alone?’ Brother!” His hands clenched the bone of his head, shaking, tightening, his eyes shut. “But what do I do now? Who do I hit, who do I tell to lay off, stop bothering me, this damn rain, like the pinching, always on you, that’s all you hear, that’s all you feel!” “We’ll be at the other Sun Dome by four this afternoon.” “Sun Dome? Look at this one! What if all the Sun Domes on Venus are gone? What then? What if there are holes in all the ceilings, and the rain coming in!” “We’ll have to chance it.” “I’m tired of chancing it. All I want is a roof and some quiet. I want to be alone.” “That’s only eight hours off, if you hold on.” “Let’s eat,” said Simmons, watching him. They set off down the coast, southward again. After four hours they had to cut inland to go around a river that was a mile wide and so swift it was not navigable by boat. They had to walk inland six miles to a place where the river boiled out of the earth, suddenly, like a mortal wound. In the rain, they walked on solid ground and returned to the sea. “I’ve got to sleep,” said Pickard at last. He slumped. “Haven’t slept in four weeks. Tried, but couldn’t. Sleep here.” They lay out full, propping their heads up so the water wouldn’t come to their mouths, and they closed their eyes. The lieutenant twitched. He did not sleep. There were things that crawled on his skin. Things grew upon him in layers. Drops fell and touched other drops and they became streams that trickled over his body, and while these moved down his flesh, the small growths of the forest took root in his clothing. He felt the ivy cling and make a second garment over him; he felt the small flowers bud and open and petal away, and still the rain pattered on his body and on his head. In the luminous night—for the vegetation glowed in the darkness—he could see the other two men outlined, like logs that had fallen and taken upon themselves velvet coverings of grass and flowers. The rain hit his face. He covered his face with his   hands. The rain hit his neck. He turned over on his stomach in the mud, on the rubbery plants, and the rain hit his back and hit his legs. Suddenly he leaped up and began to brush the water from himself. A thousand hands were touching him and he no longer wanted to be touched. He no longer could stand being touched. He floundered and struck something else and knew that it was Simmons, standing up in the rain, sneezing moisture, coughing and choking. And then Pickard was up, shouting, running about. “Wait a minute, Pickard!” “Stop it, stop it!” Pickard screamed. He fired off his gun six times at the night sky. In the flashes of powdery illumination they could see armies of raindrops, suspended as in a vast motionless amber, for an instant, hesitating as if shocked by the explosion, fifteen billion droplets, fifteen billion tears, fifteen billion ornaments, jewels standing out against a white velvet viewing board. And then, with the light gone, the drops which had waited to have their pictures taken, which had suspended their downward rush, fell upon them, stinging, in an insect cloud of coldness and pain. “Stop it! Stop it!” “Pickard!” But Pickard was only standing now, alone. When the lieutenant switched on a small hand lamp and played it over Pickard’s wet face, the eyes of the man were dilated, and his mouth was open, his face turned up, so the water hit and splashed on his tongue, and hit and drowned the wide eyes, and bubbled in a whispering froth on the nostrils. “Pickard!” The man would not reply. He simply stood there for a long while with the bubbles of rain breaking out in his whitened hair and manacles of rain jewels dripping from his wrists and his neck. “Pickard! We’re leaving. We’re going on. Follow us.” The rain dripped from Pickard’s ears. “Do you hear me, Pickard!” It was like shouting down a well. “Pickard!” “Leave him alone,” said Simmons. “We can’t go on without him.” “What’ll we do, carry him?” Simmons spat. “He’s no good to us or himself. You know what he’ll do?  He’ll just stand here and drown.” “What?” “You ought to know that by now. Don’t you know the story? He’ll just stand here with his head up and let the rain come in his nostrils and his mouth. He’ll breathe the water.” “That’s how they found General Mendt that time. Sitting on a rock with his head back, breathing the rain. His lungs were full of water.” The lieutenant turned the light back to the unblinking face. Pickard’s nostrils gave off a tiny whispering wet sound. “Pickard!” The lieutenant slapped the face. “He can’t even feel you,” said Simmons. “A few days in this rain and you don’t have any face or any legs or hands.” The lieutenant looked at his own hand in horror. He could no longer feel it. “But we can’t leave Pickard here.” “I’ll show you what we can do.” Simmons fired his gun. Pickard fell into the raining earth. Simmons said, “Don’t move, Lieutenant. I’ve got my gun ready for you too. Think it over; he would only have stood or sat there and drowned. It’s quicker this way.” The lieutenant blinked at the body. “But you killed him.” “Yes, because he’d have killed us by being a burden. You saw his face. Insane.” After a moment the lieutenant nodded. “All right.” They walked off into the rain. It was dark and their hand lamps threw a beam that pierced the rain for only a few feet. After a half hour they had to stop and sit through the rest of the night, aching with hunger, waiting for the dawn to come; when it did come it was gray and continually raining as before, and they began to walk again. “We’ve miscalculated,” said Simmons. “No. Another hour.” “Speak louder. I can’t hear you.” Simmons stopped and smiled. “By Christ,” he said, and touched his ears. “My ears. They’ve gone out on me. All the rain pouring finally numbed me right down to the bone.”  “Can’t you hear anything?” said the lieutenant. “What?” Simmons’s eyes were puzzled. “Nothing. Come on.” “I think I’ll wait here. You go on ahead.” “You can’t do that.” “I can’t hear you. You go on. I’m tired. I don’t think the Sun Dome is down this way. And, if it is, it’s probably got holes in the roof, like the last one. I think I’ll just sit here.” “Get up from there!” “So long, Lieutenant.” “You can’t give up now.” “I’ve got a gun here that says I’m staying. I just don’t give a damn any more. I’m not crazy yet, but I’m the next thing to it. I don’t want to go out that way. As soon as you get out of sight I’m going to use this gun on myself.” “Simmons!” “You said my name. I can read that much off your lips.” “Simmons.” “Look, it’s a matter of time. Either I die now or in a few hours. Wait’ll you get to that next Dome, if you ever get there, and find rain coming in through the roof. Won’t that be nice?” The lieutenant waited and then splashed off in the rain. He turned and called back once, but Simmons was only sitting there with the gun in his hands, waiting for him to get out of sight. He shook his head and waved the lieutenant on. The lieutenant didn’t even hear the sound of the gun. He began to eat the flowers as he walked. They stayed down for a time, and weren’t poisonous; neither were they particularly sustaining, and he vomited them up, sickly, a minute or so later. “Another five minutes,” he told himself. “Another five minutes and then I’ll walk into the sea and keep walking. We weren’t made for this; no Earthman was or ever will be able to take it. Your nerves, your nerves. He floundered his way through a sea of slush and foliage and came to a small hill. At a distance there was a faint yellow smudge in the cold veils of water.  The next Sun Dome. Through the trees, a long round yellow building, far away. For a moment he only stood, swaying, looking at it. He began to run and then he slowed down, for he was afraid. He didn’t call out. What if it’s the same one? What if it’s the dead Sun Dome, with no sun in it? he thought. He slipped and fell. Lie here, he thought; it’s the wrong one. Lie here. It’s no use. Drink all you want. But he managed to climb to his feet again and crossed several creeks, and the yellow light grew very bright, and he began to run again, his feet crashing into mirrors and glass, his arms flailing at diamonds and precious stones. He stood before the yellow door. The printed letters over it said THE SUN DOME. He put his numb hand up to feel it. Then he twisted the doorknob and stumbled in. He stood for a moment looking about. Behind him the rain whirled at the door. Ahead of him, upon a low table, stood a silver pot of hot chocolate, steaming, and a cup, full, with a marshmallow in it. An beside that, on another tray, stood thick sandwiches of rich chicken meat and fresh-cut tomatoes and green onions. And on a rod just before his eyes was a great thick green Turkish towel, and a bin in which to throw wet clothes, and, to his right, a small cubicle in which heat rays might dry you instantly. And upon a chair, a fresh change of uniform, waiting for anyone—himself, or any lost one—to make use of it. And farther over, coffee in steaming copper urns, and a phonograph from which music was playing quietly, and books bound in red and brown leather. And near the books a cot, a soft deep cot upon which one might lie, exposed and bare, to drink in the rays of the one great bright thing which dominated the long room. He put his hands to his eyes. He saw other men moving toward him, but said nothing to them. He waited, and opened his eyes, and looked. The water from his uniform pooled at his feet and he felt it drying from his hair and his face and his chest and his arms and his legs. He was looking at the sun. It hung in the center of the room, large and yellow and warm. It made not a sound, and there was no sound in the room. The door was shut and the rain only a memory to his tingling body. The sun hung high in the blue sky of the room, warm, hot, yellow, and very fine. He walked forward, tearing off his clothes as he went.
SAUL WILLIAMS awoke to the still morning. He looked wearily out of his tent and thought about how far away Earth was. Millions of miles, he thought. But then what could you do about it? Your lungs were full of the “blood rust.” You coughed all the time. Saul arose this particular morning at seven o’clock. He was a tall man, lean, thinned by his illness. It was a quiet morning on Mars, with the dead sea bottom-flat and silent—no wind on it. The sun was clear and cool in the empty sky. He washed his face and ate breakfast. After that he wanted very much to be back on Earth. During the day he tried every way that it was possible to be in New York City. Sometimes, if he sat right and held his hands a certain way, he did it. He could almost smell New York. Most of the time, though, it was impossible. Later in the morning Saul tried to die. He lay on the sand and told his heart to stop. It continued beating. He imagined himself leaping from a cliff or cutting his wrists, but laughed to himself— he knew he lacked the nerve for either act. Maybe if I squeeze tight and think about it enough, I’ll just sleep and never wake, he thought. He tried it. An hour later he awoke with a mouth full of blood. He got up and spat it out and felt very sorry for himself. This blood rust—it filled your mouth and your nose; it ran from your ears, your fingernails; and it took a year to kill you. The only cure was shoving you in a rocket and shooting you out to exile on Mars. There was no known cure on Earth, and remaining there would contaminate and kill others. So here he was, bleeding all the time, and lonely. Saul’s eyes narrowed. In the distance, by an ancient city ruin, he saw another man lying on a filthy blanket. When Saul walked up, the man on the blanket stirred weakly. “Hello, Saul,” he said. “Another morning,” said Saul. “Christ, I’m lonely!” “It is an affliction of the rusted ones,” said the man on the blanket, not moving, very pale and as if he might vanish if you touched him. “I wish to God,” said Saul, looking down at the man, “that you could at least talk. Why is it that intellectuals never get the blood rust and come up here?” “It is a conspiracy against you, Saul,” said the man, shutting his eyes, too weary to keep them open. “Once I had the strength to be an intellectual. Now, it is a job to think.” “If only we could talk,” said Saul Williams.  The other man merely shrugged indifferently. “Come tomorrow. Perhaps I’ll have enough strength to talk about Aristotle then. I’ll try. Really I will.” The man sank down under the worn tree. He opened one eye. “Remember, once we did talk on Aristotle, six months ago, on that good day I had.” “I remember,” said Saul, not listening. He looked at the dead sea. “I wish I were as sick as you, then maybe I wouldn’t worry about being an intellectual. Then maybe I’d get some peace.” “You’ll get just as bad as I am now in about six months,” said the dying man. “Then you won’t care about anything but sleep and more sleep. Sleep will be like a woman to you. You’ll always go back to her, because she’s fresh and good and faithful and she always treats you kindly and the same. You only wake up so you can think about going hack to sleep. It’s a nice thought.” The man’s voice was a bare whisper. Now it stopped and a light breathing took over. Saul walked off. Along the shores of the dead sea, like so many emptied bottles flung up by some long-gone wave, were the huddled bodies of sleeping men. Saul could see them all down the curve of the empty sea. One, two, three—all of them sleeping alone, most of them worse off than he, each with his little cache of food, each grown into himself, because social converse was weakening and sleep was good. At first there had been a few nights around mutual campfires. And they had all talked about Earth. That was the only thing they talked about. Earth and the way the waters ran in town creeks and what homemade strawberry pie tasted like and how New York looked in the early morning coming over on the Jersey ferry in the salt wind. I want Earth, thought Saul. I want it so bad it hurts. I want something I can never have again. And they all want it and it hurts them not to have it. More than food or a woman or anything, I just want Earth. This sickness puts women away forever; they’re not things to be wanted. But Earth, yes. That’s a thing for the mind and not the weak body. The bright metal flashed on the sky. Saul looked up. The bright metal flashed again. A minute later the rocket landed on the sea bottom. A valve opened, a man stepped out, carrying his luggage with him. Two other men, in protective germicide suits, accompanied him, bringing out vast cases of food, setting up a tent for him. Another minute and the rocket returned to the sky. The exile stood alone. Saul began to run. He hadn’t run in weeks, and it was very tiring, but he ran and yelled.  “Hello, hello!” The young man looked Saul up and down when he arrived. “Hello. So this is Mars. My name’s Leonard Mark.” “I’m Saul Williams.” They shook hands. Leonard Mark was very young—only eighteen; very blond, pink-faced, blueeyed and fresh in spite of his illness. “How are things in New York?” said Saul. “Like this,” said Leonard Mark. And he looked at Saul. New York grew up out of the desert, made of stone and filled with March winds. Neons exploded in electric color. Yellow taxis glided in a still night. Bridges rose and tugs chanted in the midnight harbors. Curtains rose on spangled musicals. Saul put his hands to his head, violently. “Hold on, hold on!” he cried. “What’s happening to me? What’s wrong with me? I’m going crazy!” Leaves sprouted from trees in Central Park, green and new. On the pathway Saul strolled along, smelling the air. “Stop it, stop it, you fool!” Saul shouted at himself. He pressed his forehead with his hands. “This can’t be!” “It is,” said Leonard Mark. The New York towers faded. Mars returned. Saul stood on the empty sea bottom, staring limply at the young newcomer. “You,” he said, putting his hand out to Leonard Mark. “You did it. You did it with your mind.” “Yes,” said Leonard Mark. Silently they stood facing each other. Finally, trembling, Saul seized the other exile’s hand and wrung it again and again, saying, “Oh, but I’m glad you’re here. You can’t know how glad I am!”  They drank their rich brown coffee from the tin cups.  It was high noon. They had been talking all through the warm morning time. “And this ability of yours?” said Saul over his cup, looking steadily at the young Leonard Mark. “It’s just something I was born with,” said Mark, looking into his drink. “My mother was in the blowup of London back in ’57. I was born ten months later. I don’t know what you’d call my ability. Telepathy and thought transference, I suppose. I used to have an act. I traveled all around the world. Leonard Mark, the mental marvel, they said on the billboards. I was pretty well off. Most people thought I was a charlatan. You know what people think of theatrical folks. Only I knew I was really genuine, but I didn’t let anybody know. It was safer not to let it get around too much. Oh, a few of my close friends knew about my real ability. I had a lot of talents that will come in handy now that I’m here on Mars.” “You sure scared the hell out of me,” said Saul, his cup rigid in his hand. “When New York came right up out of the ground that way, I thought I was insane.” “It’s a form of hypnotism which affects all of the sensual organs at once—eyes, ears, nose, mouth, skin—all of them. What would you like to be doing now most of all?” Saul put down his cup. He tried to hold his hands very steady. He wet his lips. “I’d like to be in a little creek I used to swim in in Mellin Town, Illinois, when I was a kid. I’d like to be starknaked and swimming.” “Well,” said Leonard Mark and moved his head ever so little. Saul fell back on the sand, his eyes shut. Leonard Mark sat watching him. Saul lay on the sand. From time to time his hands moved, twitched excitedly. His mouth spasmed open; sounds issued from his tightening and relaxing throat. Saul began to make slow movements of his arms, out and back, out and back, gasping with his head to one side, his arms going and coming slowly on the warm air, stirring the yellow sand under him, his body turning slowly over. Leonard Mark quietly finished his coffee. While he drank he kept his eyes on the moving, whispering Saul lying there on the dead sea bottom. “All right,” said Leonard Mark. Saul sat up, rubbing his face. After a moment he told Leonard Mark, “I saw the creek. I ran along the bank and I took off my clothes,” he said breathlessly, his smile incredulous. “And I dived in and swam around!”  “I’m pleased,” said Leonard Mark. “Here!” Saul reached into his pocket and drew forth his last bar of chocolate. “This is for you.” “What’s this?” Leonard Mark looked at the gift. “Chocolate? Nonsense, I’m not doing this for pay. I’m doing it because it makes you happy. Put that thing back in your pocket before I turn it into a rattlesnake and it bites you.” “Thank you, thank you!” Saul put it away. “You don’t know how good that water was.” He fetched the coffeepot. “More?” Pouring the coffee, Saul shut his eyes a moment. I’ve got Socrates here, he thought; Socrates and Plato, and Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. This man, by his talk, is a genius. By his talent, he’s incredible! Think of the long, easy days and the cool nights of talk we’ll have. It won’t be a bad year at all. Not half. He spilled the coffee. “What’s wrong?” “Nothing.” Saul himself was confused, startled. We’ll be in Greece, he thought. In Athens. We’ll be in Rome, if we want, when we study the Roman writers. We’ll stand in the Parthenon and the Acropolis. It won’t be just talk, but it’ll be a place to be, besides. This man can do it. He has the power to do it. When we talk the plays of Racine, he can make a stage and players and all of it for me. By Christ, this is better than life ever was! How much better to be sick and here than well on Earth without these abilities! How may people have ever seen a Greek drama played in a Greek amphitheater in the year 31 B.C.?  And if I ask, quietly and earnestly, will this man take on the aspect of Schopenhauer and Darwin and Bergson and all the other thoughtful men of the ages . . . ? Yes, why not? To sit and talk with Nietzsche in person, with Plato himself . . . ! There was only one thing wrong. Saul felt himself swaying. The other men. The other sick ones along the bottom of this dead sea. In the distance men were moving, walking toward them.  They had seen the rocket flash, land, dislodge a passenger. Now they were coming, slowly, painfully, to greet the new arrival. Saul was cold. “Look,” he said. “Mark, I think we’d better head for the mountains.” “Why?” “See those men coming? Some of them are insane.” “Really?” “Yes.” “Isolation and all make them that way?” “Yes, that’s it. We’d better get going.” “They don’t look very dangerous. They move slowly.” “You’d be surprised.” Mark looked at Saul. “You’re trembling. Why’s that?” “There’s no time to talk,” said Saul, getting up swiftly. “Come on. Don’t you realize what’ll happen once they discover your talent? They’ll fight over you. They’ll kill each other—kill you—for the right to own you.” “Oh, but I don’t belong to anybody,” said Leonard Mark. He looked at Saul. “No. Not even you.” Saul jerked his head. “I didn’t even think of that.” “Didn’t you now?” Mark laughed. “We haven’t time to argue,” answered Saul, eyes blinking, cheeks blazing. “Come on!” “I don’t want to. I’m going to sit right here until those men show up. You’re a little too possessive. My life’s my own.” Saul felt an ugliness in himself. His face began to twist. “You heard what I said.” “How very quickly you changed from a friend to an enemy, observed Mark. Saul hit at him. It was a neat quick blow, coming down. Mark ducked aside, laughing. “No, you don’t!” They were in the center of Times Square. Cars roared, hooting, upon them. Buildings plunged up, hot, into the blue air.  “It’s a lie!” cried Saul, staggering under the visual impact. “For God’s sake, don’t, Mark! The men are coming. You’ll be killed!” Mark sat there on the pavement, laughing at his joke. “Let them come. I can fool them all!” New York distracted Saul. It was meant to distract—meant to keep his attention with its unholy beauty, after so many months away from it. Instead of attacking Mark he could only stand, drinking in the alien but familiar scene. He shut his eyes. “No.” And fell forward, dragging Mark with him. Horns screamed in his ears. Brakes hissed and caught violently. He smashed at Mark’s chin. Silence. Mark lay on the sea bottom. Taking the unconscious man in his arms, Saul began to run, heavily. New York was gone. There was only the wide soundlessness of the dead sea. The men were closing in around him. He headed for the hills with his precious cargo, with New York and green country and fresh springs and old friends held in his arms. He fell once and struggled up. He did not stop running.  Night filled the cave. The wind wandered in and out, tugging at the small fire, scattering ashes. Mark opened his eyes. He was tied with ropes and leaning against the dry wall of the cave, facing the fire. Saul put another stick on the fire, glancing now and again with a catlike nervousness at the cave enhance. “You’re a fool.” Saul started. “Yes,” said Mark, “you’re a fool. They’ll find us. If they have to hunt for six months they’ll find us. They saw New York, at a distance, like a mirage. And us in the center of it. It’s too much to think they won’t be curious and follow our trail.” “I’ll move on with you then,” said Saul, staring into the fire. “And they’ll come after.”  “Shut up!” Mark smiled. “Is that the way to speak to your wife?” “You heard me!” “Oh, a fine marriage this is—your greed and my mental ability. What do you want to see now? Shall I show you a few more of your childhood scenes?” Saul felt the sweat coming out on his brow. He didn’t know if the man was joking or not. “Yes,” he said. “All right,” said Mark, “watch!” Flame gushed out of the rocks. Sulphur choked him. Pits of brimstone exploded, concussions rocked the cave. Heaving up, Saul coughed and blundered, burned, withered by hell! Hell went away. The cave returned. Mark was laughing. Saul stood over him. “You,” he said coldly, bending down. “What else do you expect?” cried Mark. “To be tied up, toted off, made the intellectual bride of a man insane with loneliness—do you think I enjoy this?” “I’ll untie you if you promise not to run away.” “I couldn’t promise that. I’m a free agent. I don’t belong to anybody.” Saul got down on his knees. “But you’ve got to belong, do you hear? You’ve got to belong. I can’t let you go away!” “My dear fellow, the more you say things like that, the more remote I am. If you’d had any sense and done things intelligently, we’d have been friends. I’d have been glad to do you these little hypnotic favors. After all, they’re no trouble for me to conjure up. Fun, really. But you’ve botched it. You wanted me all to yourself. You were afraid the others would take me away from you. Oh, how mistaken you were. I have enough power to keep them all happy. You could have shared me, like a community kitchen. I’d have felt quite like a god among children, being kind, doing favors, in return for which you might bring me little gifts, special tidbits of food.” “I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” Saul cried. “But I know those men too well.” “Are you any different? Hardly! Go out and see if they’re coming. I thought I heard a noise.”  Saul ran. In the cave entrance he cupped his hands, peering down into the night-filled gully. Dim shapes stirred. Was it only the wind blowing the roving clumps of weeds? He began to tremble— a fine, aching tremble. “I don’t see anything.” He came back into an empty cave. He stared at the fireplace. “Mark!” Mark was gone. There was nothing but the cave, filled with boulders, stones, pebbles, the lonely fire flickering, the wind sighing. And Saul standing there, incredulous and numb. “Mark! Mark! Come back!” The man had worked free of his bonds, slowly, carefully, and using the ruse of imagining he heard other men approaching, had gone—where? The cave was deep, but ended in a blank wall. And Mark could not have slipped past him into the night. How then? Saul stepped around the fire. He drew his knife and approached a large boulder that stood against the cave wall. Smiling, he pressed the knife against the boulder. Smiling, he tapped the knife there. Then he drew his knife back to plunge it into the boulder. “Stop!” shouted Mark. The boulder vanished. Mark was there. Saul suspended his knife. The fire played on his cheeks. His eyes were quite insane. “It didn’t work,” he whispered. He reached down and put his hands on Mark’s throat and closed his fingers. Mark said nothing, but moved uneasily in the grip, his eyes ironic, telling things to Saul that Saul knew. If you kill me, the eyes said, where will all your dreams be? If you kill me, where will all the streams and brook trout be? Kill me, kill Plato, kill Aristotle, kill Einstein; yes, kill all of us! Go ahead, strangle me. I dare you. Saul’s fingers released the throat. Shadows moved into the cave mouth.  Both men turned their heads. The other men were there. Five of them, haggard with travel, panting, waiting in the outer rim of light. “Good evening,” called Mark, laughing. “Come in, come in, gentlemen!”  By dawn the arguments and ferocities still continued. Mark sat among the glaring men, rubbing his wrists, newly released from his bonds. He created a mahogany-paneled conference hall and a marble table at which they all sat, ridiculously bearded, evil-smelling, sweating and greedy men, eyes bent upon their treasure. “The way to settle it,” said Mark at last “is for each of you to have certain hours of certain days for appointments with me. I’ll treat you all equally. I’ll be city property, free to come and go. That’s fair enough. As for Saul here, he’s on probation. When he’s proved he can be a civil person once more, I’ll give him a treatment or two. Until that time, I’ll have nothing more to do with him.” The other exiles grinned at Saul. “I’m sorry,” Saul said. “I didn’t know what I was doing. I’m all right now.” “We’ll see,” said Mark. “Let’s give ourselves a month, shall we?” The other men grinned at Saul. Saul said nothing. He sat staring at the floor of the cave. “Let’s see now,” said Mark. “On Mondays it’s your day, Smith.” Smith nodded. “On Tuesdays I’ll take Peter there, for an hour or so. Peter nodded. “On Wednesdays I’ll finish up with Johnson, Holtzman, and Jim, here.” The last three men looked at each other. “The rest of the week I’m to be left strictly alone, do you hear?” Mark told them. “A little should be better than nothing. If you don’t obey, I won’t perform at all.”  “Maybe we’ll make you perform,” said Johnson. He caught the other men’s eye. “Look, we’re five against his one. We can make him do anything we want. If we co-operate, we’ve got a great thing here.” “Don’t be idiots,” Mark warned the other men. “Let me talk,” said Johnson. “He’s telling us what he’ll do. Why don’t we tell him! Are we bigger than him, or not? And him threatening not to perform! Well, just let me get a sliver of wood under his toenails and maybe burn his fingers a bit with a steel file, and we’ll see if he performs! Why shouldn’t we have performances, I want to know, every night in the week?” “Don’t listen to him!” said Mark. “He’s crazy. He can’t be depended on. You know what he’ll do, don’t you? He’ll get you all off guard, one by one, and kill you; yes, kill all of you, so that when he’s done, he’ll be alone—just him and me! That’s his sort.” The listening men blinked. First at Mark, then at Johnson. “For that matter,” observed Mark, “none of you can trust the others. This is a fool’s conference. The minute your back is turned one of the other men will murder you. I dare say, at the week’s end, you’ll all be dead or dying.” A cold wind blew into the mahogany room. It began to dissolve and became a cave once more. Mark was tired of his joke. The marble table splashed and rained and evaporated. The men gazed suspiciously at each other with little bright animal eyes. What was spoken was true. They saw each other in the days to come, surprising one another, killing—until that last lucky one remained to enjoy the intellectual treasure that walked among them. Saul watched them and felt alone and disquieted. Once you have made a mistake, how hard to admit your wrongness, to go back, start fresh. They were all wrong. They had been lost a long time. Now they were worse than lost. “And to make matters very bad,” said Mark at last, “one of you has a gun. All the rest of you have only knives. But one of you, I know, has a gun. Everybody jumped up. “Search!” said Mark. “Find the one with the gun or you’re all dead!” That did it. The men plunged wildly about, not knowing whom to search first. Their hands grappled, they cried out, and Mark watched them in contempt. Johnson fell back, feeling in his jacket. “All right,” he said. “We might as well have it over now! Here, you, Smith.” And he shot Smith through the chest. Smith fell. The other men yelled. They broke apart. Johnson aimed and fired twice more.  “Stop!” cried Mark. New York soared up around them, out of rock and cave and sky. Sun glinted on high towers. The elevated thundered; tugs blew in the harbor. The green lady stared across the bay, a torch in her hand. “Look, you fools!” said Mark. Central Park broke out constellations of spring blossoms. The wind blew fresh-cut lawn smells over them in a wave. And in the center of New York, bewildered, the men stumbled. Johnson fired his gun three times more. Saul ran forward. He crashed against Johnson, bore him down, wrenched the gun away. It fired again. The men stopped milling. They stood. Saul lay across Johnson. They ceased struggling. There was a terrible silence. The men stood watching. New York sank down into the sea. With a hissing, bubbling, sighing; with a cry of ruined metal and old time, the great structures leaned, warped, flowed, collapsed. Mark stood among the buildings. Then, like a building, a neat red hole drilled into his chest, wordless, he fell. Saul lay staring at the men, at the body. He got up, the gun in his hand. Johnson did not move—was afraid to move. They all shut their eyes and opened them again, thinking that by so doing they might reanimate the man who lay before them. The cave was cold. Saul stood up and looked, remotely, at the gun in his hand. He took it and threw it far out over the valley and did not watch it fall. They looked down at the body as if they could not believe it. Saul bent down and took hold of the limp hand. “Leonard!” he said softly. “Leonard?” He shook the hand. “Leonard!” Leonard Mark did not move. His eyes were shut; his chest had ceased going up and down. He was getting cold.  Saul got up. “We’ve killed him,” he said, not looking at the men. His mouth was filling with a raw liquor now. “The only one we didn’t want to kill, we killed.” He put his shaking hand to his eyes. The other men stood waiting. “Get a spade,” said Saul. “Bury him.” He turned away. “I’ll have nothing to do with you.” Somebody walked off to find a spade.  Saul was so weak he couldn’t move. His legs were grown into the earth, with roots feeding deep of loneliness and fear and the cold of the night. The fire had almost died out and now there was only the double moonlight riding over the blue mountains. There was the sound of someone digging in the earth with a spade. “We don’t need him anyhow,” said somebody, much too loudly. The sound of digging went on. Saul walked off slowly and let himself slide down the side of a dark tree until he reached and was sitting blankly on the sand, his hands blindly in his lap. Sleep, he thought. We’ll all go to sleep now. We have that much, anyway. Go to sleep and try to dream of New York and all the rest. He closed his eyes wearily, the blood gathering in his nose and his mouth and in his quivering eyes. “How did he do it?” he asked in a tired voice. His head fell forward on his chest. “How did he bring New York up here and make us walk around in it? Lct’s try. It shouldn’t be too hard. Think! Think of New York,” he whispered, falling down into sleep. “New York and Central Park and then Illinois in the spring, apple blossoms and green grass. It didn’t work. It wasn’t the same. New York was gone and nothing he could do would bring it back. He would rise every morning and walk on the dead sea looking for it, and walk forever around Mars, looking for it, and never find it. And finally lie, too tired to walk, trying to find New York in his head, but not finding it. The last thing he heard before he slept was the spade rising and falling and digging a hole into which, with a tremendous crash of metal and golden mist and odor and color and sound, New York collapsed, fell, and was buried. He cried all night in his sleep.
"Ready ?" "Ready." "Now ?" "Soon." "Do the scientists really know? Will it happen today, will it ?" "Look, look; see for yourself !" The children pressed to each other like so many roses, so many weeds, intermixed, peering out for a look at the hidden sun. It rained. It had been raining for seven years; thousands upon thousands of days compounded and filled from one end to the other with rain, with the drum and gush of water, with the sweet crystal fall of showers and the concussion of storms so heavy they were tidal waves come over the islands. A thousand forests had been crushed under the rain and grown up a thousand times to be crushed again. And this was the way life was forever on the planet Venus, and this was the schoolroom of the children of the rocket men and women who had come to a raining world to set up civilization and live out their lives. "It’s stopping, it’s stopping !" "Yes, yes !" Margot stood apart from them, from these children who could ever remember a time when there wasn’t rain and rain and rain. They were all nine years old, and if there had been a day, seven years ago, when the sun came out for an hour and showed its face to the stunned world, they could not recall. Sometimes, at night, she heard them stir, in remembrance, and she knew they were dreaming and remembering gold or a yellow crayon or a coin large enough to buy the world with. She knew they thought they remembered a warmness, like a blushing in the face, in the body, in the arms and legs and trembling hands. But then they always awoke to the tatting drum, the endless shaking down of clear bead necklaces upon the roof, the walk, the gardens, the forests, and their dreams were gone. All day yesterday they had read in class about the sun. About how like a lemon it was, and how hot. And they had written small stories or essays or poems about it: "I think the sun is a flower,That blooms for just one hour." That was Margot’s poem, read in a quiet voice in the still classroom while the rain was falling outside. "Aw, you didn’t write that!" protested one of the boys. "I did," said Margot. "I did." "William!" said the teacher. But that was yesterday. Now the rain was slackening, and the children were crushed in the great thick windows. "Where’s teacher ?" "She’ll be back." "She’d better hurry, we’ll miss it !" They turned on themselves, like a feverish wheel, all tumbling spokes. Margot stood alone. She was a very frail girl who looked as if she had been lost in the rain for years and the rain had washed out the blue from her eyes and the red from her mouth and the yellow from her hair. She was an old photograph dusted from an album, whitened away, and if she spoke at all her voice would be a ghost. Now she stood, separate, staring at the rain and the loud wet world beyond the huge glass. "What’re you looking at ?" said William. Margot said nothing. "Speak when you’re spoken to." He gave her a shove. But she did not move; rather she let herself be moved only by him and nothing else. They edged away from her, they would not look at her. She felt them go away. And this was because she would play no games with them in the echoing tunnels of the underground city. If they tagged her and ran, she stood blinking after them and did not follow. When the class sang songs about happiness and life and games her lips barely moved. Only when they sang about the sun and the summer did her lips move as she watched the drenched windows. And then, of course, the biggest crime of all was that she had come here only five years ago from Earth, and she remembered the sun and the way the sun was and the sky was when she was four in Ohio. And they, they had been on Venus all their lives, and they had been only two years old when last the sun came out and had long since forgotten the color and heat of it and the way it really was. But Margot remembered. "It’s like a penny," she said once, eyes closed. "No it’s not!" the children cried. "It’s like a fire," she said, "in the stove." "You’re lying, you don’t remember !" cried the children. But she remembered and stood quietly apart from all of them and watched the patterning windows. And once, a month ago, she had refused to shower in the school shower rooms, had clutched her hands to her ears and over her head, screaming the water mustn’t touch her head. So after that, dimly, dimly, she sensed it, she was different and they knew her difference and kept away. There was talk that her father and mother were taking her back to Earth next year; it seemed vital to her that they do so, though it would mean the loss of thousands of dollars to her family. And so, the children hated her for all these reasons of big and little consequence. They hated her pale snow face, her waiting silence, her thinness, and her possible future. "Get away !" The boy gave her another push. "What’re you waiting for?" Then, for the first time, she turned and looked at him. And what she was waiting for was in her eyes. "Well, don’t wait around here !" cried the boy savagely. "You won’t see nothing!" Her lips moved. "Nothing !" he cried. "It was all a joke, wasn’t it?" He turned to the other children. "Nothing’s happening today. Is it ?" They all blinked at him and then, understanding, laughed and shook their heads. "Nothing, nothing !" "Oh, but," Margot whispered, her eyes helpless. "But this is the day, the scientists predict, they say, they know, the sun…" "All a joke !" said the boy, and seized her roughly. "Hey, everyone, let’s put her in a closet before the teacher comes !" "No," said Margot, falling back. They surged about her, caught her up and bore her, protesting, and then pleading, and then crying, back into a tunnel, a room, a closet, where they slammed and locked the door. They stood looking at the door and saw it tremble from her beating and throwing herself against it. They heard her muffled cries. Then, smiling, the turned and went out and back down the tunnel, just as the teacher arrived. "Ready, children ?" She glanced at her watch. "Yes !" said everyone. "Are we all here ?" "Yes !" The rain slacked still more.They crowded to the huge door. The rain stopped. It was as if, in the midst of a film concerning an avalanche, a tornado, a hurricane, a volcanic eruption, something had, first, gone wrong with the sound apparatus, thus muffling and finally cutting off all noise, all of the blasts and repercussions and thunders, and then, second, ripped the film from the projector and inserted in its place a beautiful tropical slide which did not move or tremor. The world ground to a standstill. The silence was so immense and unbelievable that you felt your ears had been stuffed or you had lost your hearing altogether. The children put their hands to their ears. They stood apart. The door slid back and the smell of the silent, waiting world came in to them. The sun came out. It was the color of flaming bronze and it was very large. And the sky around it was a blazing blue tile color. And the jungle burned with sunlight as the children, released from their spell, rushed out, yelling into the springtime. "Now, don’t go too far," called the teacher after them. "You’ve only two hours, you know. You wouldn’t want to get caught out !" But they were running and turning their faces up to the sky and feeling the sun on their cheeks like a warm iron; they were taking off their jackets and letting the sun burn their arms. "Oh, it’s better than the sun lamps, isn’t it?" "Much, much better !" They stopped running and stood in the great jungle that covered Venus, that grew and never stopped growing, tumultuously, even as you watched it. It was a nest of octopi, clustering up great arms of fleshlike weed, wavering, flowering in this brief spring. It was the color of rubber and ash, this jungle, from the many years without sun. It was the color of stones and white cheeses and ink, and it was the color of the moon. The children lay out, laughing, on the jungle mattress, and heard it sigh and squeak under them resilient and alive. They ran among the trees, they slipped and fell, they pushed each other, they played hideand-seek and tag, but most of all they squinted at the sun until the tears ran down their faces; they put their hands up to that yellowness and that amazing blueness and they breathed of the fresh, fresh air and listened and listened to the silence which suspended them in a blessed sea of no sound and no motion. They looked at everything and savored everything. Then, wildly, like animals escaped from their caves, they ran and ran in shouting circles. They ran for an hour and did not stop running. And then - In the midst of their running one of the girls wailed. Everyone stopped. The girl, standing in the open, held out her hand. "Oh, look, look," she said, trembling. They came slowly to look at her opened palm. In the center of it, cupped and huge, was a single raindrop. She began to cry, looking at it. They glanced quietly at the sun. "Oh. Oh." A few cold drops fell on their noses and their cheeks and their mouths. The sun faded behind a stir of mist. A wind blew cold around them. They turned and started to walk back toward the underground house, their hands at their sides, their smiles vanishing away. A boom of thunder startled them and like leaves before a new hurricane, they tumbled upon each other and ran. Lightning struck ten miles away, five miles away, a mile, a half mile. The sky darkened into midnight in a flash. They stood in the doorway of the underground for a moment until it was raining hard. Then they closed the door and heard the gigantic sound of the rain falling in tons and avalanches, everywhere and forever. "Will it be seven more years ?" "Yes. Seven." Then one of them gave a little cry. "Margot !" "What ?" "She’s still in the closet where we locked her." "Margot." They stood as if someone had driven them, like so many stakes, into the floor. They looked at each other and then looked away. They glanced out at the world that was raining now and raining and raining steadily. They could not meet each other’s glances. Their faces were solemn and pale. They looked at their hands and feet, their faces down. "Margot." One of the girls said, "Well… ?" No one moved. "Go on," whispered the girl. They walked slowly down the hall in the sound of cold rain. They turned through the doorway to the room in the sound of the storm and thunder, lightning on their faces, blue and terrible. They walked over to the closet door slowly and stood by it. Behind the closet door was only silence. They unlocked the door, even more slowly, and let Margot out.
He looked through the cold morning windows with the Jack-in-the-Box in his hands, prying the rusted lid. But no matter how he struggled, the Jack would not jump to the light with a cry, or slap its velvet mittens on the air, or bob in a dozen directions with a wild and painted smile. Crushed under the lid, in its jail, it stayed crammed tight coil on coil. With your ear to the box, you felt pressure beneath, the fear and panic of the trapped toy. It was like holding someone's heart in your hand. Edwin could not tell if the box pulsed or if his own blood beat against the lid.  He threw the box down and looked to the window. Outside the window the trees surrounded the house which surrounded Edwin. He could not see beyond the trees. If he tried to find another World beyond them, the trees wove themselves thick with the wind, to still his curiosity, to stop his eyes.  "Edwin!" Behind him, Mother's waiting, nervous breath as she drank her breakfast coffee. "Stop staring. Come eat."  "No," he whispered.  "What?" A stiffened rustle. She must have turned. "Which is more important, breakfast or that window?"  "The window. . ." he whispered and sent his gaze running the paths and trails he had tried for thirteen years. Was it true that the trees flowed on ten thousand miles to nothingness? He could not say. His sight returned defeated, to the lawn, the steps, his hands trembling on the pane.  He turned to eat his tasteless apricots, alone with his mother in the vast and echoing breakfast room. Five thousand mornings at this table, this window, and no movement beyond the trees.  The two of them ate silently.  She was the pale woman that no one but the birds saw in old country houses in fourth-floor cupola windows, each morning at six, each afternoon at four, each evening at nine, and also passing by one minute after midnight, there she would be, in her tower, silent and white, high and alone and quiet. It was like passing a deserted greenhouse in which one last wild white blossom lifted its head to the moonlight.  And her child, Edwin, was the thistle that one breath of wind might unpod in a season of thistles. His hair was silken and his eyes were of a constant blue and feverish temperature. He had a haunted look, as if he slept poorly. He might fly apart like a packet of ladyfinger firecrackers if a certain door slammed.  His mother began to talk, slowly and with great caution, then more rapidly, and then angrily, and then almost spitting at him.  "Why must you disobey every morning? I don't like your staring from the window, do you hear? What do you want? Do you want to see them?" she cried, her fingers twitching. She was blazingly lovely, like an angry white flower. "Do you want to see the Beasts that run down paths and crush people like strawberries?"  Yes, he thought, I'd like to see the Beasts, horrible as they are.  "Do you want to go out there," she cried, "like your father did before you were born, and be killed as he was killed, struck down by one of those Terrors on the road, would you like that?"  "No . . ."  "Isn't it enough they murdered your Father? Why should you even think of those Beasts?" She motioned toward the forest. "Well, if you really want to die that much, go ahead!"  She quieted, but her fingers kept opening and closing on the tablecloth. "Edwin, Edwin, your Father built every part of this World, it was beautiful for him, it should be for you. There's nothing, nothing, beyond those trees but death; I won't have you near it! This is the World. There's no other worth bothering with."  He nodded miserably.  "Smile now, and finish your toast," she said.  He ate slowly, with the window reflected in secret on his silver spoon.  "Mom . . .?" He couldn't say it. "What's . . . dying? You talk about it. Is it a feeling?"  "To those who must live on after someone else, a bad feeling, yes." She stood up suddenly. "You're late for school! Run!"  He kissed her as he grabbed his books. "Bye!"  "Say hello to Teacher!"  He fled from her like a bullet from gun. Up endless staircases, through passages, halls, past windows that poured down dark gallery panels like white waterfalls. Up, up through the layercake Worlds with the thick frostings of Oriental rug between, and bright candles on top.  From the highest stair he gazed down through four intervals of Universe.  Lowlands of kitchen, dining room, parlor. Two Middle Countries of music, games, pictures, and locked, forbidden rooms. And here--he whirled--the Highlands of picnics, adventure, and learning. Here he roamed, idled, or sat singing lonely child songs on the winding journey to school.  This, then, was the Universe. Father (or God, as Mother often called him) had raised its mountains of wailpapered plaster long ago. This was Father-God's creation, in which stars blazed at the flick of a switch. And the sun was Mother, and Mother was the sun, about which all the Worlds swung, turning. And Edwin, a small dark meteor, spun up around through the dark carpets and shimmering tapestries of space. You saw him rise to vanish on vast comet staircases, on hikes and explorations.  Sometimes he and Mother picnicked in the Highlands, spread cool snow linens on red-tuffed, Persian lawns, on crimson meadows in a rarefied plateau at the summit of the Worlds where flaking portraits of sallow strangers looked meanly down on their eating and their revels. They drew water from silver taps in hidden tiled niches, smashed the tumblers on hearthstones, shrieking. Played hide-and-seek in enchanted Upper Countries, in unknown, wild, and hidden lands, where she found him rolled like a mummy in a velvet window drape or under sheeted furniture like a rare plant protected from some wind. Once, lost, he wandered for hours in insane foothills of dust and echoes, where the hooks and hangers in closets were hung only with night. But she found him and carried him weeping down through the leveling Universe to the Parlor where dust motes, exact and familiar, fell in showers of sparks on the sunlit air.  He ran up a stair.  Here he knocked a thousand thousand doors, all locked and forbidden. Here Picasso ladies and Dali gentlemen screamed silently from canvas asylums, their gold eyes burning when he dawdled.  "Those Things live out there ," his mother had said, pointing to the Dali-Picasso families.  Now running quickly past, he stuck out his tongue at them.  He stopped running.  One of the forbidden doors stood op en.  Sunlight slanted warm through it, exciting him.  Beyond the door, a spiral stair screwed around up in sun and silence.  He stood, gasping. Year after year he had tried the doors that were always found locked. What would happen now if he shoved this one full open and climbed the stair? Was some Monster hiding at the top?  "Hello!"  His voice leapt up around the spiraled sunlight. "Hello . . ." whispered a faint, far lazy echo, high, high, and gone.  He moved through the door.  "Please, please, don't hurt me," he whispered to the high sunlit place.  He climbed, pausing with each step to wait for his punishment, eyes shut like a penitent. Faster now, he leapt around and around and up until his knees ached and his breath fountained in and out and his head banged like a bell and at last he reached the terrible summit of the climb and stood in an open, sun-drenched tower.  The sun struck his eyes a blow. Never, never so much sun! He stumbled to the iron rail.  "It's there!" His mouth opened from one direction to another. "It's there!" He ran in a circle. "There!"  He was above the somber tree barrier. For the first time he stood high over the windy chestnuts and elms and as far as he could see was green grass, green trees, and white ribbons on which beetles ran, and the other half of the world was blue and endless, with the sun lost and dropping away in an incredible deep blue room so vast he felt himself fall with it, screamed, and clutched the tower ledge, and beyond the trees, beyond the white ribbons where the beetles ran he saw things like fingers sticking up, but he saw no Dali-Picasso terrors, he saw only some small red-and-white-andblue handkerchiefs fluttering high on great white poles.  He was suddenly sick; he was sick again.  Turning, he almost fell flat down the stairs.  He slammed the forbidden door, fell against it  "You'll go blind." He crushed his hands to his eyes. "You shouldn't have seen, you shouldn't, you shouldn't!"  He fell to his knees, he lay on the floor twisted tight, covered up. He need wait but a moment--the blindness would come.  Five minutes later he stood at an ordinary Highlands window, looking out at his own familiar Garden World.  He saw once more the elms and hickory trees and the stone wall, and that forest which he had taken to be an endless wall itself, beyond which lay nothing but nightmare nothingness, mist, rain, and eternal night. Now it was certain, the Universe did not end with the forest. There were other worlds than those contained in Highland or Lowland.  He tried the forbidden door again. Locked.  Had he really gone up? Had he really discovered those halfgreen, half-blue vastnesses? Had God seen him? Edwin trembled. God. God, who smoked mysterious black pipes and wielded magical walking sticks. God who might be watching even now!  Edwin murmured, touching his cold face.  "I can still see. Thank you, thank you. I can still see!"  At nine-thirty, half an hour late, he rapped on the school door.  "Good morning, Teacher!"  The door swung open. Teacher waited in her tall gray, thickclothed monk's robe, the cowl hiding her face. She wore her usual silver spectacles. Her gray-gloved hands beckoned.  "You're late."  Beyond her the land of books burned in bright colors from the hearth. There were walls bricked with encyclopedias, and a fireplace in which you could stand without bumping your head. A log blazed fiercely.  The door closed, and there was a warm quiet. Here was the desk, where God had once sat, he'd walked this carpet, stuffing his pipe with rich tobacco, and scowled out that vast, stained-glass window. The room smelled of God, rubbed wood, tobacco, leather, and silver coins. Here, Teacher's voice sang like a solemn harp, telling of God, the old days, and the World when it had shaken with God's determination, trembled at his wit, when the World was abuilding under God's hand, a blueprint, a cry, and timber rising. God's fingerprints still lay like half-melted snowflakes on a dozen sharpened pencils in a locked glass display. They must never never be touched lest they melt away forever.  Here, here in the Highlands, to the soft sound of Teacher's voice running on, Edwin learned what was expected of him and his body. He was to grow into a Presence, he must fit the odors and the trumpet voice of God. He must some day stand tall and burning with pale fire at this high window to shout dust off the beams of the Worlds; he must be God Himself! Nothing must prevent it. Not the sky or the trees or the Things beyond the trees.  Teacher moved like a vapor in the room.  "Why are you late, Edwin?"  "I don't know."  "I'll ask you again. Edwin why are you late?"  "One--one of the forbidden doors was open. . . ."  He heard the hiss of Teacher's breath. He saw her slowly slide back and sink into the large hand-carved chair, swallowed by darkness, her glasses flashing light before they vanished. He felt her looking out at him from shadow and her voice was numbed and so like a voice he heard at night, his own voice crying just before he woke from some nightmare. "Which door? Where?" she said. "Oh, it must be locked!"  "The door by the Dali-Picasso people," he said, in panic. He and Teacher had always been friends. Was that finished now? Had he spoiled things? "I climbed the stair. I had to, I had to! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please, don't tell Mother!"  Teacher sat lost in the hollow chair, in the hollow cowl. Her glasses made faint firefly glitters in the well where she moved alone. "And what did you see up there?" she murmured.  "A big blue room!"  "Did you?"  "And a green one, and ribbons with bugs running on them, hut I didn't, I didn't stay long, I swear, I swear!"  "Green room, ribbons, yes ribbons, and the little bugs running along them, yes," she said, and her voice made him sad.  He reached out for her hand, but it fell away to her lap and groped back, in darkness, to her breast. "I came right down, I locked the door, I won't go look again, ever!" he cried.  Her voice was so faint he could hardly hear what she said. "But now you've seen, and you'll want to see more, and you'll always he curious now." The cowl moved slowly back and forth. Its deepness turned toward him, questioning. "Did you-- like what you saw?"  "I was scared. It was big."  "Big, yes, too big. Large, large, so large, Edwin. Not like our world. Big, large, uncertain. Oh, why did you do this! You knew it was wrong!"  The fire bloomed and withered on the hearth while she waited for his answer and finally when he could not answer she said, as if her lips were barely moving, "Is it your Mother?"  "I don't know!"  "Is she nervous, is she mean, does she snap at you, does she hold too tight, do you want time alone, is that it, is that it, is that it?"  "Yes, yes!" he sobbed, wildly.  "Is that why you ran off, she demands all your time, all your thoughts?" Lost and sad, her voice. "Tell me . . ."  His hands had gone sticky with tears. "Yes!" He bit his fingers and the backs of his hands. "Yes!" It was wrong to admit such things, but he didn't have to say them now, she said them, she said them, and all he must do is agree, shake his head, bite his knuckles, cry out between sobs.  Teacher was a million years old.  "We learn," she said, wearily. Rousing from her chair, she moved with a slow swaying of gray robes to the desk where her gloved hand searched a long time to find pen and paper. "We learn, Oh God, but slowly, and with pain, we learn. We think we do right, but all the time, all the time, we kill the Plan. . . ." She hissed hef breath, jerked her head up suddenly. The cowl looked completely empty, shivering.  She wrote words on the paper.  "Give this to your mother. It tells her you must have two full hours every afternoon to yourself, to prowl where you wish. Anywhere. Except out there . Are you listening, child?"  "Yes." He dried his face. "But--"  "Go on."  "Did Mother lie to me about out there , and the Beasts?"  "Look at me," she said. "I've been your friend, I've never beaten you, as your mother sometimes must. We're both here to help you understand and grow so you won't be destroyed as God was."  She arose, and in rising, turned the cowl such a way that color from the hearth washed over her face. Swiftly, the firelight erased her many wrinkles.  Edwin gasped. His heart gave a jolting thump. "The fire!"  Teacher froze.  "The fire!" Edwin looked at the fire and back to her face. The cowl jerked away from his gaze, the face vanished in the deep well, gone. "Your face," said Edwin numbly. "You look like Mother!"  She moved swiftly to the books, seized one down. She talked to the shelves in her high, singing monotonous voice. "Women look alike, you know that! Forget it! Here, here!" And she brought him the book. "Read the first chapter! Read the diary!"  Edwin took the book but did not feel its weight in his hands. The fire rumbled and sucked itself brilliantly up the flue as he began to read and as he read Teacher sank back down and settled and quieted and the more he read the more the gray cowl nodded and became serene, the hidden face like a clapper gone solemn in its bell. Firelight ignited the gold animal lettering of the shelved books as he read and he spoke the words but was really thinking of these books from which pages had been razored, and clipped, certain lines erased, certain pictures torn, the leather jaws of some books glued tight, others like mad dogs, muzzled in hard bronze straps to keep him away. All this he thought while his lips moved through the fire-quiet:  "In the Beginning was God, Who created the Universe, and the Worlds within the Universe, the Continents within the Worlds and the Lands within the Continents, and shaped from His mind and hand His loving wife and a child who in time would he God Himself . . ."  Teacher nodded slowly. The fire fell softly away to slumbering coals. Edwin read on.  Down the banister, breathless, he slid into the Parlor. "Mom, Mom!"  She lay in a plump maroon chair, breathless, as if she, too, had run a great way.  "Mom, Mom, you're soaking wet!"  "Am I?" she said, as if it was his fault she'd been rushing about. "So I am, so I am." She took a deep breath and sighed. Then she took his hands and kissed each one. She looked at him steadily, her eyes dilating. "Well now, listen here, I've a surprise! Do you know what's coming tomorrow? You can't guess! Your birthday!"  "But it's only been ten months!"  "Tomorrow it is! Do us wonders, I say. And anything I say is so is really so, my dear."  She laughed.  "And we open another secret room?" He was dazed.  "The fourteenth room, yes! Fifteenth room next year, sixteenth, seventeenth, and so on and on till your twenty-first birthday, Edwin! Then, oh, then we'll open up the triple-locked doors to the most important room and you'll be Man of the House, Father, God, Ruler of the Universe!"  "Hey," he said. And, "Hey!" He tossed his books straight up in the air. They exploded like a great burst of doves, whistling. He laughed. She laughed. Their laughter flew and fell with the books. He ran to scream down the banister again.  At the bottom of the stairs, she waited, arms wide, to catch him.  Edwin lay on his moonlit bed and his fingers pried at the Jack-in-the-Box, but the lid stayed shut; he turned it in his hands, blindly, but did not look down at it. Tomorrow, his birthday--but why? Was he that good? No. Why then, should the birthday come so soon? Well, simply because things had gotten, what word could you use? Nervous? Yes, things had begun to shimmer by day as well as by night. He saw the white tremor, the moonlight sifting down and down of an invisible snow in his mother's face. It would take yet another of his birthdays to quiet her again.  "My birthdays," he said to the ceiling, "will come quicker from now on. I know, I know. Mom laughs so loud, so much, and her eyes are funny. . . ."  Would Teacher be invited to the party? No. Mother and Teacher had never met. "Why not?" "Because," said Mom. "Don't you want to meet Mom, Teacher?" "Some day," said Teacher, faintly, blowing off like cobwebs in the hall. "Some . . . day. . . ."  And where did Teacher go at night? Did she drift through all those secret mountain countries high up near the moon where the chandeliers were skinned blind with dust, or did she wander out beyond the trees that lay beyond the trees that lay beyond the trees? No, hardly that!  He twisted the toy in his sweating hands. Last year, when things began to tremble and quiver, hadn't Mother advanced his birthday several months, too? Yes, oh, yes, yes.  Think of something else. God. God building cold midnight cellar, sun-baked attic, and all miracles between. Think of the hour of His death, crushed by some monstrous beetle beyond the wall. Oh, how the Worlds must have rocked with His passing!  Edwin moved the Jack-in-the-Box to his face, whispered against the lid. "Hello! Hello! Hello, hello . . ."  No answer save the sprung-tight coiled-in tension there. I'll get you out, thought Edwin. Just wait, just wait. It may hurt, but there's only one way. Here, here . . .  And he moved from bed to window and leaned far out, looking down to the marbled walk in the moonlight. He raised the box high, felt the sweat trickle from his armpit, felt his fingers clench, felt his arm jerk. He flung the box out, shouting. The box tumbled in the cold air, down. It took a long time to strike the marble pavement.  Edwin bent still further over, gasping.  "Well?" he cried. "Well?" and again, "You there!" and "You!"  The echoes faded. The box lay in the forest shadows. He could not see if the crash had broken it wide. He could not see if the Jack had risen, smiling, from its hideous jail or if it bobbed upon the wind now this way, that, this way, that, its silver bells jingling softly. He listened. He stood by the window for an hour staring, listening, and at last went back to bed.  Morning. Bright voices moved near and far, in and out the Kitchen World and Edwin opened his eyes. Whose voices, now whose could they he? Some of God's workmen? The Dali people? But Mother hated them; no. The voices faded in a humming roar. Silence. And from a great distance, a running, running grew louder and still louder until the door burst open.  "Happy Birthday!"  They danced, they ate frosted cookies, they bit lemon ices, they drank pink wines, and there stood his name on a snow-powdered cake as Mother chorded the piano into an avalanche of sound and opened her mouth to sing, then whirled to seize him away to more strawberries, more wines, more laughter that shook chandeliers into trembling rain. Then, a silver key flourished, they raced to unlock the fourteenth forbidden door.  "Ready! Hold on!"  The door whispered into the wall.  "Oh," said Edwin.  For, disappointingly enough, this fourteenth room was nothing at all but a dusty dull-brown closet. It promised nothing as had the rooms given him on other anniversaries! His sixth birthday present, now, had been the schoolroom in the Highlands. On his seventh birthday he had opened the playroom in the Lowlands. Eighth, the music room; ninth, the miraculous hell-fired kitchen! Tenth was the room where phonographs hissed in a continuous exhalation of ghosts singing on a gentle wind. Eleventh was the vast green diamond room of the Garden with a carpet that had to be cut instead of swept!  "Oh, don't be disappointed; move!" Mother, laughing, pushed him in the closet. "Wait till you see how magical! Shut the door!"  She thrust a red button flush with the wall.  Edwin shrieked. "No!"  For the room was quivering, working, like a mouth that held them in iron jaws; the room moved, the wall slid away below.  "Oh, hush now, darling," she said. The door drifted down through the floor, and a long insanely vacant wall slithered by like an endlessly rustling snake to bring another door and another door with it that did not stop but traveled on while Edwin screamed and clutched his mother's waist. The room whined and cleared its throat somewhere; the trembling ceased, the room stood still. Edwin stared at a strange new door and heard his mother say go on, open it, there, now, there. And the new door gaped upon still further mystery. Edwin blinked.  "The Highlands! This is the Highlands! How did we get here? Where's the Parlor, Mom, where's the Parlor?"  She fetched him out through the door. "We jumped straight up, and we flew. Once a week, you'll fly to school instead of running the long way around!"  He still could not move, but only stood looking at the mystery of Land exchanged for Land, of Country replaced by higher and further Country.  "Oh, Mother, Mother . . ." he said.  It was a sweet long time in the deep grass of the garden where they idled most deliciously, sipped huge cupfuls of apple cider with their elbows on crimson silk cushions, their shoes kicked off, their toes bedded in sour dandelions, sweet clover. Mother jumped twice when she heard Monsters roar beyond the forest. Edwin kissed her cheek. "It's all right," he said, "I'll protect you."  "I know you will," she said, but she turned to gaze at the pattern of trees, as if any moment the chaos out there might smash the forest with a blow and stamp its Titan's foot down and grind them to dust.  Late in the long blue afternoon, they saw a chromium bird thing fly through a bright rift in the trees, high and roaring. They ran for the Parlor, heads bent as before a green storm of lightning and rain, feeling the sound pour blinding showers to drench them.  Crackle, crackle--the birthday burnt away to cellophane nothingness. At sunset, in the dim soft Parlor Country, Mother inhaled champagne with her tiny seedling nostrils and her pale summerrose mouth, then, drowsy wild, herded Edwin off to his room and shut him in.  He undressed in slow-pantomimed wonder, thinking, this year, next year, and which room two years, three years, from today? What about the Beasts, the Monsters? And being mashed and God killed? What was killed? What was Death? Was Death a feeling? Did God enjoy it so much he never came back? Was Death a journey then?  In the hail, on her way downstairs, Mother dropped a champagne bottle. Edwin heard and was cold, for the thought that jumped through his head was, that's how Mother'd sound. If she fell, if she broke, you'd find a million fragments in the morning. Bright crystal and clear wine on the parquet flooring, that's all you'd see at dawn.  Morning was the smell of vines and grapes and moss in his room, a smell of shadowed coolness. Downstairs, breakfast was in all probability, at this instant, manifesting itself in a fingersnap on the wintry tables.  Edwin got up to wash and dress and wait, feeling fine. Now things would be fresh and new for at least a month. Today, like all days, there'd be breakfast, school, lunch, songs in the music room, an hour or two at the electrical games, then--tea in the Outlands, on the luminous grass. Then up to school again for a late hour or so, where he and Teacher might prowl the censored library together and he'd puzzle with words and thoughts about that world out there that had been censored from his eyes.  He had forgotten Teacher's note. Now, he must give it to Mother.  He opened the door. The hall was empty. Down through the deeps of the Worlds, a soft mist floated, through a silence which no footsteps broke; the hills were quiet; the silver fonts did not pulse in the first sunlight, and the banister, coiling up from the mists was a prehistoric monster peering into his room. He pulled away from this creature, looking to find Mother, like a white boat, drifted by the dawn tides and vapors below.  She was not there. He hurried down through the hushed lands, calling, "Mother!"  He found her in the Parlor, collapsed on the floor in her shiny green-gold party dress, a champagne goblet in one hand, the carpet littered with broken glass.  She was obviously asleep, so he sat at the magical breakfast table. He blinked at the empty white cloth and the gleaming plates. There was no food. All his life wondrous foods had awaited him here. But not today.  "Mother, wake up!" He ran to her. "Shall I go to school? Where's the food? Wake up!"  He ran up the stairs.  The Highlands were cold and shadowed, and the white glass suns no longer glowed from the ceilings in this day of sullen fog. Down dark corridors, through dim continents of silence, Edwin rushed. He rapped and rapped at the school door. It drifted in, whining, by itself.  The school lay empty and dark. No fire roared on the hearth to toss shadows on the beamed ceiling. There was not a crackle or a whisper.  "Teacher?"  He poised in the center of the flat, cold room.  "Teacher!" he screamed.  He slashed the drapes aside; a faint shaft of sunlight fell through the stained glass.  Edwin gestured. He commanded the fire to explode like a popcorn kernel on the hearth. He commanded it to bloom to life! He shut his eyes, to give Teacher time to appear. He opened his eyes and was stupefied at what he saw on her desk.  Neatly folded was the gray cowl and robe, atop which gleamed her silver spectacles, and one gray glove. He touched them. One gray glove was gone. A piece of greasy cosmetic chalk lay on the robe. Testing it, he made dark lines on his hands.  He drew back, staring at Teacher's empty robe, the glasses, the greasy chalk. His hand touched a knob of a door which had always been locked. The door swung slowly wide. He looked into a small brown closet.  "Teacher!"  He ran in, the door crashed shut, he pressed a red button. The room sank down, and with it sank a slow mortal coldness. The World was silent, quiet, and cool. Teacher gone and Mother--sleeping. Down fell the room, with him in its iron jaws.  Machinery clashed. A door slid open. Edwin ran out.  The Parlor!  Behind was not a door, but a tall oak panel from which he had emerged.  Mother lay uncaring, asleep. Folded under her, barely showing as he rolled her over, was one of Teacher's soft gray gloves.  He stood near her, holding the incredible glove, for a long time. Finally, he began to whimper.  He fled back up to the Highlands. The hearth was cold, the room empty. He waited. Teacher did not come. He ran down again to the solemn Lowlands, commanded the table to fill with steaming dishes! Nothing happened. He sat by his mother, talking and pleading with her and touching her, and her hands were cold.  The clock ticked and the light changed in the sky and still she did not move, and he was hungry and the silent dust dropped down on the air through all the Worlds. He thought of Teacher and knew that if she was in none of the hills and mountains above, then there was only one place she could be. She had wandered, by error, into the Outlands, lost until someone found her. And so he must go out, call after her, bring her back to wake Mother, or she would lie here forever with the dust falling in the great darkened spaces.  Through the kitchen, out back, he found late afternoon sun and the Beasts hooting faintly beyond the rim of the World. He clung to the garden wall, not daring to let go, and in the shadows, at a distance, saw the shattered box he had flung from the window. Freckles of sunlight quivered on the broken lid and touched tremblingly over and over the face of the Jack jumped out and sprawled with its arms overhead in an eternal gesture of freedom. The doll smiled and did not smile, smiled and did not smile, as the sun winked on the mouth, and Edwin stood, hypnotized, above and beyond it. The doll opened its arms toward the path that led off between the secret trees, the forbidden path smeared with oily droppings of the Beasts. But the path lay silent and the sun warmed Edwin and he heard the wind blow softly in the trees. At last, he let go of the garden wall.  "Teacher?"  He edged along the path a few feet.  "Teacher!"  His shoes slipped on the animal droppings and he stared far down the motionless tunnel, blindly. The path moved under, the trees moved over him.  "Teacher!"  He walked slowly but steadily. He turned. Behind him lay his World and its very new silence. It was diminished, it was small! How strange to see it less than it had been. It had always and forever seemed so large. He felt his heart stop. He stepped back. But then, afraid of that silence in the World, he turned to face the forest path ahead.  Everything before him was new. Odors filled his nostrils, colors, odd shapes, incredible sizes filled his eyes.  If I run beyond the trees I'll die, he thought, for that's what Mother said. You'll die, you'll die.  But what's dying? Another room? A blue room, a green room, far larger than all the rooms that ever were! But where's the key? There, far ahead, a great half-open iron door, a wrought-iron gate. Beyond a room as large as the sky, all colored green with trees and grass! Oh, Mother, Teacher . . .  He rushed, stumbled, fell, got up, ran again, his numb legs under him were left behind as he fell down and down the side of a hill, the path gone, wailing, crying, and then not wailing or crying any more, but making new sounds. He reached the great rusted, screaming iron gate, leapt through; the Universe dwindled behind, he did not look back at his old Worlds, but ran as they withered and vanished.  The policeman stood at the curb, looking down the street.  "These kids. I'll never be able to figure them."  "How's that?" asked the pedestrian.  The policeman thought it over and frowned. "Couple seconds ago a little kid ran by. He was laughing and crying, crying and laughing, both. He was jumping up and down and touching things. Things like lampposts, the telephone poles, fire hydrants, dogs, people. Things like sidewalks, fences, gates, cars, plateglass windows, barber poles. Hell, he even grabbed hold and looked at me, and looked at the sky, you should have seen the tears, and all the time he kept yelling and yelling something funny."  "What did he yell?" asked the pedestrian.  "He kept yelling, 'I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm glad I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm glad I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, it's good to be dead!' "The policeman scratched his chin slowly. "One of them new kid games, I guess."
THE city waited twenty thousand years.  The planet moved through space and the flowers of the fields grew up and fell away, and still the city waited; and the rivers of the planet rose and waned and turned to dust. Still the city waited. The winds that had been young and wild grew old and serene, and the clouds of the sky that had been ripped and torn were left alone to drift in idle whitenesses. Still the city waited.  The city waited with its windows and its black obsidian walls and its sky towers and its unpennanted turrets, with its untrod streets and its untouched doorknobs, with not a scrap of paper or a fingerprint upon it. The city waited while the planet arced in space, following its orbit about a blue-white sun, and the seasons passed from ice to fire and back to ice and then to green fields and yellow summer meadows.   It was on a summer afternoon in the middle of the twenty thousandth year that the city ceased waiting.   In the sky a rocket appeared.  The rocket soared over, turned, came back, and landed in the shale meadow fifty yards from the obsidian wall.   There were booted footsteps in the thin grass and calling voices from men within the rocket to men without.  "Ready?"  "All right, men. Careful! Into the city. Jensen, you and Hutchinson patrol ahead. Keep a sharp eye."  The city opened secret nostrils in its black walls and a steady suction vent deep in the body of the city drew storms of air back through channels, through thistle filters and dust collectors, to a fine and tremblingly delicate series of coils and webs which glowed with silver light. Again and again the immense suctions occurred; again and again the odors from the meadow were borne upon warm winds into the city.  "Fire odor, the scent of a fallen meteor, hot metal. A ship has come from another world. The brass smell, the fusty fire smell of burned powder, sulphur, and rocket brimstone."  This information, stamped on tapes which sprocketed into slots, slid down through yellow cogs into further machines.  Click-chakk-chakk-chakk.   A calculator made the sound of a metronome. Five, sic, seven, eight, nine. Nine men! An instantaneous typewriter inked this message on tape which slithered and vanished.  Clickety-click-chakk-chakk.   The city awaited the soft tread of their rubberoid boots.   The great city nostrils dilated again.  The smell of butter. In the city air, from the stalking men, faintly, the aura which wafted to the great Nose broke down into memories of milk, cheese, ice cream, butter, the effluvium of a dairy economy.  Click-click.   "Careful, men!"  "Jones, get your gun out. Don't be a fool!"  "The city's dead, why worry?"  "You can't tell."  Now, at the barking talk, the Ears awoke. After centuries of listening to winds that blew small and faint, of hearing leaves strip from trees and grass grow softly in the time of melting snows, now the Ears oiled themselves in a self-lubrication, drew taut, great drums upon which the heartbeat of the invaders might pummel and thud delicately as the tremor of a gnat's wing. The Ears listened and the Nose siphoned up great chambers of odor.  The perspiration of frightened men arose. There were islands of sweat under their arms, and sweat in theirs hands at they held guns.  The Nose sifted and worried this air, like a connoisseur busy with an ancient vintage.   Chikk-chikk-chakk-click.   Information rotated down on parallel check tapes. Perspiration; chlorides such and such per cent; sulphates so-and-so' urea nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, thus: creatinine, sugar, lactic acid, there!  Bells rang. Small totals jumped up.   The Nose whispered, expelling the tested air. The great Ears listened:  "I think we should go back to the rocket, Captain."  "I give the orders, Mr.Smith!"  "Yes, sir."  "You up there! Patrol! See anything?"  "Nothing, sir. Looks like it's been dead  long time!"  "You see, Smith? Nothing to fear."  "I don't like it. I don't know why. You ever feel you've seen a place before? Well, this city's too familiar."  "Nonsense. This planetary system's billions of miles from Earth: we couldn't possibly've been here ever before. Ours is the only light-year rocket in existence."  "That's how I feel, anyway, sir. I think we should get out." The footsteps faltered. There was only the sound of the intruder's breath on the still air.   The Ear heard and quickened. Rotors glided, liquids glittered in small creeks through valves and blowers. A formula and concoction-one followed another. Moments later, responding to the summons of the Ear and Nose, through giant holes in the city walls a fresh vapor blew out over the invaders.  "Smell that, Smith? Ahh. Green grass. Ever smell anything better? By God, I just like to stand here and smell it."  Invisible chlorophyll blew among the standing men.   "Ahh!"  The footsteps continued.  "Nothing wrong with that, eh, Smith? Come on!"   The Ear and Nose relaxed a billionth of a fraction. The countermove had succeeded. The pawns were proceeding forward.  Now the cloudy Eyes of the city moved out of fog and mist.  "Captain, the windows!"  "What?"  "Those house windows, there! I saw them move!"  "I didn't see it."  "They shifted. They changed color. From dark to light."  "Look like ordinary square windows to me."  Blurred objects focused. In the mechanical ravines of the city oiled shafts plunged, balance wheels dipped over into green oil pools. The window frames flexed. The windows gleamed.  Below, in the street, walked two men, a patrol, followed, at a safe interval, by seven more. Their uniforms were white, their faces as pink  as if they had been slapped; their eyes were blue. They walked upright, upon hind legs, carrying metal weapons. Their feet were booted. They were males, with eyes, ears, mouths, noses.   The windows trembled. The windows thinned. They dilated imperceptibly, like the irises of numberless eyes.  "I tell you, Captain, it's the windows!"  "Get along."  "I'm going back, sir."  "What?"  "I'm going back to the rocket."  "Mr. Smith!"  "I'm not falling into any trap!"  "Afraid of an empty city?"  The others laughed, uneasily.  "Go on, laugh!"  The street was stone-cobbled, each stone three inches wide, six inches long. With a move unrecognizable as such, the street settled. It weighed the invaders.   In a machine cellar a red wand touched a numeral: 178 pounds . . . 210, 154, 201, 198,- each man weighed, registered and the record spooled down into a correlative darkness.  Now the city was fully awake!  Now the vents sucked and blew air, the tobacco odor from the invaders' mouths, the green soap scent from their hands. Even their eyeballs had a delicate odor. The city detected it, and this information formed totals which scurried down to total other totals. Te crystal windows glittered, the Ear tautened and skinned the drum of its hearing tight, tighter- all of the senses of the city swarming like a fall of unseen snow, counting the respiration and the dim hidden heartbeats of the men, listening, watching, tasting.  For the streets were like tongues, and where the men passed, the taste of their heels ebbed down through stone pores to be calculated on litmus. This chemical totality, so subtly collected, was appended to the new increasing sums waiting the final calculation among the whirling wheels and whispering spokes.  Footsteps. Running.   "Come back! Smith!"  "No, blast you!"  "Get him, men!"  Footsteps rushing.  A final test. The city, having listened, watched, tasted, felt, weighed, and balanced, must perform a final task.  A trap flung wide in the street. The captain, unseen to the others, running, vanished.  Hung by his feet, a razor drawn across his throat, another down his chest, his carcass instantly emptied of its entrails, exposed upon a table under the street, in a hidden cell, the captain died. Great crystal microscopes stared at the red twines of muscle; bodiless fingers probed the still pulsing heart. The flaps of his sliced skin were pinned to the table while hands shifted parts of his body like a quick and curious player of chess, using the rad pawns and the red pieces.   Above on the street the men ran. Smith ran, men shouted. Smith shouted, and below in this curious room blood flowed into capsules, was shaken, spun, shoved on smear slides under further microscopes, counts made, temperatures taken, heart cut in seventeen sections, liver and kidneys expertly halved. Brain was drilled and scooped from bone socket, nerves pulled forth like the dead wires of a switchboard, muscles plucked for elasticity, while in the electric subterrene of the city the Mind at last totaled out its grandest total and all of the machinery ground to a monstrous and momentary halt.   The total.  These are men. These are men from a far world, a certain planet, and they have certain eyes, certain ears, and they walk upon legs in a specified way and carry weapons and think and fight, and they have particular hearts and all such organs as are recorded from long ago.  Above, men ran down the street toward the rocket.  Smith ran.  The total.  These are our enemies. These are the ones we have waited for twenty thousand years to see again. These are the men upon whom we waited to visit revenge. Everything totals. These are the men of a planet called Earth, who declared war upon Taollan twenty thousand years ago, who kept us in slavery and ruined us and destroyed us with a great disease. Then they went off to live in another galaxy to escape and that disease which they visited upon us after ransacking our world. They have forgotten that war and that time, and they have forgotten us. But we have not forgotten them. These are our enemies. This is certain. Our waiting is done.   "Smith, come back!"  Quickly. Upon the red table, with the spread-eagled captain's body empty, new hands began a fight of motion. Into the wet interior were placed organs of copper, brass, silver, aluminum, rubber and silk; spiders spun gold web which was stung into the skin; a heart was attached, and into the skull case was a fitted platinum brain which hummed and fluttered small sparkles of blue fire, and the wires led down through the body to the arms and legs. In a moment the body was sewn tight, the incisions waxed, healed at neck and throat and about the skull-perfect, fresh, new.   The captain sat up and flexed his arms.  "Stop!"  On the street the captain reappeared, raised his gun and fired. Smith fell, a bullet in his heart.   The other men turned.   The captain ran to them.  "That fool! Afraid of a city!"  They looked at the body of Smith at their feet.  They looked at their captain, and their eyes widened and narrowed.  "Listen to me," said the captain. "I have something important to tell you."  Now the city, which had weighed and tasted and smelled them, which had used all its powers save one, prepared to use its final ability, the power of speech.  It did not speak with the rage and hostility of its massed walls or towers, nor with bulk of its cobbled avenues and fortresses of machinery. It spoke with the quiet voice of one man.   "I am no longer you captain," he said. "Nor am I a man."  The men moved back.  "I am the city," he said and smiled.  "I've waited two hundred centuries," he said. "I've waited for the sons of the Sons of the sons to return."  "Captain, sir!"  "Let me continue. Who built me? The city. The men who died built me. The old race who once lived here. The people whom the Earthmen left to die of a terrible disease, a form of leprosy with no cure. And the men of that old race, dreaming of the day when the Earthmen might return, built this city, and the name of this city was and is Revenge, upon the planet of Darkness, near the shore of the Sea of Centuries, by the Mountains of the Dead; all very poetic. This city was to be a balancing machine, a litmus, an antenna to test all future space travelers. In twenty thousand years only two other rockets landed  here. One from a distant galaxy called Ennt, and the  inhabitants of that craft are tasted, weighed, found wanting, and let free, unscathed, from the city. As were the visitors of the second ship. But today! At long last, you've come! The revenge will be carried out to the last detail. Those men have been dead two hundred centuries, but they left a city here to welcome you."  "Captain, sir, you're not feeling well. Perhaps you'd better come back to the ship, sir."  The city trembled.  The pavements opened and the men fell, screaming. Falling, they saw bright razors flash to meet them!  Time passed. Soon came the call:  "Smith?"  "Here!"  "Jensen?"   "Here!"  "Jones, Hutchinson, Springer?"  "Here, here, here!"  They stood by the door of the rocket.  "We return to Earth immediately."  "Yes, sir!"  The incisions on their necks were invisible, as were their hidden brass hearts and silver organs and the fine golden wire of their nerves. There was a faint elector hum for their heads.   "On the double!"  Nine men hurried the golden bombs of disease culture into the rocket.  "These are to be dropped on Earth."  "Right, sir!"  The rocket valve slammed. The rocket jumped into the sky. As the thunder faded, the city lay upon the summer meadow.   Its glass eyes were dulled over. The Ears relaxed, the great Nostril vents topped, the streets no longer weighed or balanced, and the hidden machinery paused in its bath of oil.  In the sky the rocket dwindled.  Slowly, pleasurably, the city enjoyed the luxury of dying.
MISS WILLERTON always crumbed the table. It was her particular household accomplishment and she did it with great thoroughness. Lucia and Bertha did the dishes and Garner went into the parlor and did the Morning Press crossword puzzle. That left Miss Willerton in the dining room by herself and that was all right with Miss Willerton. Whew! Breakfast in that house was always an ordeal. Lucia insisted that they have a regular hour for breakfast just like they did for other meals. Lucia said a regular breakfast made for other regular habits, and with Garner’s tendency to upsets, it was imperative that they establish some system in their eating. This way she could also see that he put the Agar-Agar on his Cream of Wheat. As if, Miss Willerton thought, after having done it for fifty years, he’d be capable of doing anything else. The breakfast dispute always started with Garner’s Cream of Wheat and ended with her three spoonfuls of pineapple crush. “You know your acid, Willie,” Miss Lucia would always say, “you know your acid”; and then Garner would roll his eyes and make some sickening remark and Bertha would jump and Lucia would look distressed and Miss Willerton would taste the pineapple crush she had already swallowed. It was a relief to crumb the table. Crumbing the table gave one time to think, and if Miss Willerton were going to write a story, she had to think about it first. She could usually think best sitting in front of her typewriter, but this would do for the time being. First, she had to think of a subject to write a story about. There were so many subjects to write stories about that Miss Willerton never could think of one. That was always the hardest part of writing a story, she always said. She spent more time thinking of something to write about than she did writing. Sometimes she discarded subject after subject and it usually took her a week or two to decide finally on something. Miss Willerton got out the silver crumber and the crumb-catcher and started stroking the table. I wonder, she mused, if a baker would make a good subject? Foreign bakers were very picturesque, she thought. Aunt Myrtile Filmer had left her four color-tints of French bakers in mushroom- looking hats. They were great tall fellows—blond and.… “Willie!” Miss Lucia screamed, entering the dining room with the saltcellars. “For heaven’s sake, hold the catcher under the crumber or you’ll have those crumbs on the rug. I’ve Bisseled it four times in the last week and I am not going to do it again.” “You have not Bisseled it on account of any crumbs I have spilled,” Miss Willerton said tersely. “I always pick up the crumbs I drop,” and she added, “I drop relatively few.” “And wash the crumber before you put it up this time,” Miss Lucia returned. Miss Willerton drained the crumbs into her hand and threw them out the window. She took the catcher and crumber to the kitchen and ran them under the cold-water faucet. She dried them and stuck them back in the drawer. That was over. Now she could get to the typewriter. She could stay there until dinnertime. Miss Willerton sat down at her typewriter and let out her breath. Now! What had she been thinking about? Oh. Bakers. Hmmm. Bakers. No, bakers wouldn’t do. Hardly colorful enough. No social tension connected with bakers. Miss Willerton sat staring through her typewriter. A S D F G—her eyes wandered over the keys. Hmmm. Teachers? Miss Willerton wondered. No. Heavens no. Teachers always made Miss Willerton feel peculiar. Her teachers at Willowpool Seminary had been all right but they were women. Willowpool Female Seminary, Miss Willerton remembered. She didn’t like the phrase, Willowpool Female Seminary —it sounded biological. She always just said she was a graduate of Willowpool. Men teachers made Miss Willerton feel as if she were going to mispronounce something. Teachers weren’t timely anyhow. They weren’t even a social problem. Social problem. Social problem. Hmmm. Sharecroppers! Miss Willerton had never been intimately connected with sharecroppers but, she reflected, they would make as arty a subject as any, and they would give her that air of social concern which was so valuable to have in the circles she was hoping to travel! “I can always capitalize,” she muttered, “on the hookworm.” It was coming to her now! Certainly! Her fingers plinked excitedly over the keys, never touching them. Then suddenly she began typing at great speed. “Lot Motun,” the typewriter registered, “called his dog.” “Dog” was followed by an abrupt pause. Miss Willerton always did her best work on the first sentence. “First sentences,” she always said, “came to her—like a flash! Just like a flash!” she would say and snap her fingers, “like a flash!” And she built her story up from them. “Lot Motun called his dog” had been automatic with Miss Willerton, and reading the sentence over, she decided that not only was “Lot Motun” a good name for a sharecropper, but also that having him call his dog was an excellent thing to have a sharecropper do. “The dog pricked up its ears and slunk over to Lot.” Miss Willerton had the sentence down before she realized her error—two “Lots” in one paragraph. That was displeasing to the ear. The typewriter grated back and Miss Willerton applied three x’s to “Lot.” Over it she wrote in pencil, “him.” Now she was ready to go again. “Lot Motun called his dog. The dog pricked up its ears and slunk over to him.” Two dogs, too, Miss Willerton thought. Ummm. But that didn’t affect the ears like two “Lots,” she decided. Miss Willerton was a great believer in what she called “phonetic art.” She maintained that the ear was as much a reader as the eye. She liked to express it that way. “The eye forms a picture,” she had told a group at the United Daughters of the Colonies, “that can be painted in the abstract, and the success of a literary venture” (Miss Willerton liked the phrase, ‘literary venture’) “depends on the abstract created in the mind and the tonal quality” (Miss Willerton also liked ‘tonal quality’) “registered in the ear.” There was something biting and sharp about “Lot Motun called his dog”; followed by “the dog pricked up its ears and slunk over to him,” it gave the paragraph just the send-off it needed. “He pulled the animal’s short, scraggy ears and rolled over with it in the mud.” Perhaps, Miss Willerton mused, that would be overdoing it. But a sharecropper, she knew, might reasonably be expected to roll over in the mud. Once she had read a novel dealing with that kind of people in which they had done just as bad and, throughout three-fourths of the narrative, much worse. Lucia found it in cleaning out one of Miss Willerton’s bureau drawers and after glancing at a few randompages took it between thumb and index finger to the furnace and threw it in. “When I was cleaning your bureau out this morning, Willie, I found a book that Garner must have put there for a joke,” Miss Lucia told her later. “It was awful, but you know how Garner is. I burned it.” And then, tittering, she added, “I was sure it couldn’t be yours.” Miss Willerton was sure it could be none other’s than hers but she hesitated in claiming the distinction. She had ordered it from the publisher because she didn’t want to ask for it at the library. It had cost her $3.75 with the postage and she had not finished the last four chapters. At least, she had got enough from it, though, to be able to say that Lot Motun might reasonably roll over in the mud with his dog. Having him do that would give more point to the hookworm, too, she decided. “Lot Motun called his dog. The dog pricked up its ears and slunk over to him. He pulled the animal’s short, scraggy ears and rolled over with it in the mud.” Miss Willerton settled back. That was a good beginning. Now she would plan her action. There had to be a woman, of course. Perhaps Lot could kill her. That type of woman always started trouble. She might even goad him on to kill her because of her wantonness and then he would be pursued by his conscience maybe. He would have to have principles if that were going to be the case, but it would be fairly easy to give him those. Now how was she going to work that in with all the love interest there’d have to be, she wondered. There would have to be some quite violent, naturalistic scenes, the sadistic sort of thing one read of in connection with that class. It was a problem. However, Miss Willerton enjoyed such problems. She liked to plan passionate scenes best of all, but when she came to write them, she always began to feel peculiar and to wonder what the family would say when they read them. Garner would snap his fingers and wink at her at every opportunity; Bertha would think she was terrible; and Lucia would say in that silly voice of hers, “What have you been keeping from us, Willie? What have you been keeping from us?” and titter like she always did. But Miss Willerton couldn’t think about that now; she had to plan her characters. Lot would be tall, stooped, and shaggy but with sad eyes that made him look like a gentleman in spite of his red neck and big fumbling hands. He’d have straight teeth and, to indicate that he had some spirit, red hair. His clothes would hang on him but he’d wear them nonchalantly like they were part of his skin; maybe, she mused, he’d better not roll over with the dog after all. The woman would be more or less pretty—yellow hair, fat ankles, muddy-colored eyes. She would get supper for him in the cabin and he’d sit there eating the lumpy grits she hadn’t bothered to put salt in and thinking about something big, something way off—another cow, a painted house, a clean well, a farm of his own even. The woman would yowl at him for not cutting enough wood for her stove and would whine about the pain in her back. She’d sit and stare at him eating the sour grits and say he didn’t have nerve enough to steal food. “You’re just a damn beggar!” she’d sneer. Then he’d tell her to keep quiet. “Shut your mouth!” he’d shout. “I’ve taken all I’m gonna.” She’d roll her eyes, mocking him, and laugh—“I ain’t afraid er nothin’ that looks like you.” Then he’d push his chair behind him and head toward her. She’d snatch a knife off the table—Miss Willerton wondered what kind of a fool the woman was—and back away holding it in front of her. He’d lunge forward but she’d dart from him like a wild horse. Then they’d face each other again—their eyes brimming with hate—and sway back and forth. Miss Willerton could hear the seconds dropping on the tin roof outside. He’d dart at her again but she’d have the knife ready and would plunge it into him in an instant— Miss Willerton could stand it no longer. She struck the woman a terrific blow on the head from behind. The knife dropped out of her hands and a mist swept her from the room. Miss Willerton turned to Lot. “Let me get you some hot grits,” she said. She went over to the stove and got a clean plate of smooth white grits and a piece of butter. “Gee, thanks,” Lot said and smiled at her with his nice teeth. “You always fix ’em just right. You know,” he said, “I been thinkin’—we could get out of this tenant farm. We could have a decent place. If we made anything this year over, we could put it in a cow an’ start buildin’ things up. Think what it would mean, Willie, just think.” She sat down beside him and put her hand on his shoulder. “We’ll do it,” she said. “We’ll make better than we’ve made any year and by spring we should have us that cow.” “You always know how I feel, Willie,” he said. “You always have known.” They sat there for a long time thinking of how well they understood each other. “Finish your food,” she said finally. After he had eaten, he helped her take the ashes out the stove and then, in the hot July evening, they walked down the pasture toward the creek and talked about the place they were going to have some day. When late March came and the rainy season was almost there, they had accomplished almost more than was believable. For the past month, Lot had been up every morning at five, and Willy an hour earlier to get in all the work they could while the weather was clear. Next week, Lot said, the rain would probably start and if they didn’t get the crop in by then, they would lose it—and all they had gained in the past months. They knew what that meant—another year of getting along with no more than they’d had the last. Then too, there’d be a baby next year instead of a cow. Lot had wanted the cow anyway. “Children don’t cost all that much to feed,” he’d argued, “an’ the cow would help feed him,” but Willie had been firm—the cow could come later—the child must have a good start. “Maybe,” Lot had said finally, “we’ll have enough for both,” and he had gone out to look at the new-plowed ground as if he could count the harvest fromthe furrows. Even with as little as they’d had, it had been a good year. Willie had cleaned the shack, and Lot had fixed the chimney. There was a profusion of petunias by the doorstep and a colony of snapdragons under the window. It had been a peaceful year. But now they were becoming anxious over the crop. They must gather it before the rain. “We need another week,” Lot muttered when he came in that night. “One more week an’we can do it. Do you feel like gatherin’? It isn’t right that you should have to,” he sighed, “but I can’t hire any help.” “I’mall right,” she said, hiding her trembling hands behind her. “I’ll gather.” “It’s cloudy tonight,” Lot said darkly. The next day they worked until nightfall—worked until they could work no longer and then stumbled back to the cabin and fell into bed. Willie woke in the night conscious of a pain. It was a soft, green pain with purple lights running through it. She wondered if she were awake. Her head rolled fromside to side and there were droning shapes grinding boulders in it. Lot sat up. “Are you bad off?” he asked, trembling. She raised herself on her elbow and then sank down again. “Get Anna up by the creek,” she gasped. The droning became louder and the shapes grayer. The pain intermingled with themfor seconds first, then interminably. It came again and again. The sound of the droning grew more distinct and toward morning she realized that it was rain. Later she asked hoarsely, “How long has it been raining?” “Most two days, now,” Lot answered. “Then we lost.” Willie looked listlessly out at the dripping trees. “It’s over.” “It isn’t over,” he said softly. “We got a daughter.” “You wanted a son.” “No, I got what I wanted—two Willies instead of one—that’s better than a cow, even,” he grinned. “What can I do to deserve all I got, Willie?” He bent over and kissed her forehead. “What can I?” she asked slowly. “And what can I do to help you more?” “How about your going to the grocery, Willie?” Miss Willerton shoved Lot away from her. “W-what did you say, Lucia?” she stuttered. “I said how about your going to the grocery this time? I’ve been every morning this week and I’mbusy now.” Miss Willerton pushed back from the typewriter. “Very well,” she said sharply. “What do you want there?” “A dozen eggs and two pounds of tomatoes—ripe tomatoes—and you’d better start doctoring that cold right now. Your eyes are already watering and you’re hoarse. There’s Empirin in the bathroom. Write a check on the house for the groceries. And wear your coat. It’s cold.” Miss Willerton rolled her eyes upward. “I am forty-four years old,” she announced, “and able to take care of myself.” “And get ripe tomatoes,” Miss Lucia returned. Miss Willerton, her coat buttoned unevenly, tramped up Broad Street and into the supermarket. “What was it now?” she muttered. “Two dozen eggs and a pound of tomatoes, yes.” She passed the lines of canned vegetables and the crackers and headed for the box where the eggs were kept. But there were no eggs. “Where are the eggs?” she asked a boy weighing snapbeans. “We ain’t got nothin’ but pullet eggs,” he said, fishing up another handful of beans. “Well, where are they and what is the difference?” Miss Willerton demanded. He threw several beans back into the bin, slouched over to the egg box and handed her a carton. “There ain’t no difference really,” he said, pushing his gum over his front teeth. “A teen-age chicken or somethin’, I don’t know. You want ’em?” “Yes, and two pounds of tomatoes. Ripe tomatoes,” Miss Willerton added. She did not like to do the shopping. There was no reason those clerks should be so condescending. That boy wouldn’t have dawdled with Lucia. She paid for the eggs and tomatoes and left hurriedly. The place depressed her somehow. Silly that a grocery should depress one—nothing in it but trifling domestic doings—women buying beans—riding children in those grocery go-carts— higgling about an eighth of a pound more or less of squash—what did they get out of it? Miss Willerton wondered. Where was there any chance for self-expression, for creation, for art? All around her it was the same—sidewalks full of people scurrying about with their hands full of little packages and their minds full of little packages—that woman there with the child on the leash, pulling him, jerking him, dragging him away from a window with a jack-o’-lantern in it; she would probably be pulling and jerking him the rest of her life. And there was another, dropping a shopping bag all over the street, and another wiping a child’s nose, and up the street an old woman was coming with three grandchildren jumping all over her, and behind themwas a couple walking too close for refinement. Miss Willerton looked at the couple sharply as they came nearer and passed. The woman was plump with yellow hair and fat ankles and muddy-colored eyes. She had on high-heel pumps and blue anklets, a too-short cotton dress, and a plaid jacket. Her skin was mottled and her neck thrust forward as if she were sticking it out to smell something that was always being drawn away. Her face was set in an inane grin. The man was long and wasted and shaggy. His shoulders were stooped and there were yellow knots along the side of his large, red neck. His hands fumbled stupidly with the girl’s as they slumped along, and once or twice he smiled sickly at her and Miss Willerton could see that he had straight teeth and sad eyes and a rash over his forehead. “Ugh,” she shuddered. Miss Willerton laid the groceries on the kitchen table and went back to her typewriter. She looked at the paper in it. “Lot Motun called his dog,” it read. “The dog pricked up its ears and slunk over to him. He pulled the animal’s short, scraggy ears and rolled over with it in the mud.” “That sounds awful!” Miss Willerton muttered. “It’s not a good subject anyway,” she decided. She needed something more colorful—more arty. Miss Willerton looked at her typewriter for a long time. Then of a sudden her fist hit the desk in several ecstatic little bounces. “The Irish!” she squealed. “The Irish!” Miss Willerton had always admired the Irish. Their brogue, she thought, was full of music; and their history—splendid! And the people, she mused, the Irish people! They were full of spirit—red-haired, with broad shoulders and great, drooping mustaches.
THE GRANDMOTHER didn’t want to go to Florida. She wanted to visit some of her connections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey’s mind. Bailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the table, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. “Now look here, Bailey,” she said, “see here, read this,” and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the newspaper at his bald head. “Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the Federal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people. Just you read it. I wouldn’t take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in it. I couldn’t answer to my conscience if I did.” Bailey didn’t look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the children’s mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a cabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like a rabbit’s ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. “The children have been to Florida before,” the old lady said. “You all ought to take them somewhere else for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have been to east Tennessee.” The children’s mother didn’t seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley, a stocky child with glasses, said, “If you don’t want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at home?” He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor. “She wouldn’t stay at home to be queen for a day,” June Star said without raising her yellow head. “Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?” the grandmother asked. “I’d smack his face,” John Wesley said. “She wouldn’t stay at home for a million bucks,” June Star said. “Afraid she’d miss something. She has to go everywhere we go.” “All right, Miss,” the grandmother said. “Just remember that the next time you want me to curl your hair.” June Star said her hair was naturally curly. The next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her big black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it she was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn’t intend for the cat to be left alone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he might brush against one of the gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son, Bailey, didn’t like to arrive at a motel with a cat. She sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of her. Bailey and the children’s mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight forty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she thought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It took them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city. The old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting them up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children’s mother still had on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a navy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brimand a navy blue dress with a small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and at her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an accident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady. She said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too cold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the patrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you before you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone Mountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the brilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops that made rows of green lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of them sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother had gone back to sleep. “Let’s go through Georgia fast so we won’t have to look at it much,” John Wesley said. “If I were a little boy,” said the grandmother, “I wouldn’t talk about my native state that way. Tennessee has the mountains and Georgia has the hills.” “Tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground,” John Wesley said, “and Georgia is a lousy state too.” “You said it,” June Star said. “In my time,” said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, “children were more respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. People did right then. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!” she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in the door of a shack. “Wouldn’t that make a picture, now?” she asked and they all turned and looked at the little Negro out of the back window. He waved. “He didn’t have any britches on,” June Star said. “He probably didn’t have any,” the grandmother explained. “Little niggers in the country don’t have things like we do. If I could paint, I’d paint that picture,” she said. The children exchanged comic books. The grandmother offered to hold the baby and the children’s mother passed him over the front seat to her. She set him on her knee and bounced him and told him about the things they were passing. She rolled her eyes and screwed up her mouth and stuck her leathery thin face into his smooth bland one. Occasionally he gave her a faraway smile. They passed a large cotton field with five or six graves fenced in the middle of it, like a small island. “Look at the graveyard!” the grandmother said, pointing it out. “That was the old family burying ground. That belonged to the plantation.” “Where’s the plantation?” John Wesley asked. “Gone With the Wind,” said the grandmother. “Ha. Ha.” When the children finished all the comic books they had brought, they opened the lunch and ate it. The grandmother ate a peanut butter sandwich and an olive and would not let the children throw the box and the paper napkins out the window. When there was nothing else to do they played a game by choosing a cloud and making the other two guess what shape it suggested. John Wesley took one the shape of a cow and June Star guessed a cow and John Wesley said, no, an automobile, and June Star said he didn’t play fair, and they began to slap each other over the grandmother. The grandmother said she would tell them a story if they would keep quiet. When she told a story, she rolled her eyes and waved her head and was very dramatic. She said once when she was a maiden lady she had been courted by a Mr. Edgar Atkins Tea-garden from Jasper, Georgia. She said he was a very goodlooking man and a gentleman and that he brought her a watermelon every Saturday afternoon with his initials cut in it, E. A. T. Well, one Saturday, she said, Mr. Teagarden brought the watermelon and there was nobody at home and he left it on the front porch and returned in his buggy to Jasper, but she never got the watermelon, she said, because a nigger boy ate it when he saw the initials, E. A. T.! This story tickled John Wesley’s funny bone and he giggled and giggled but June Star didn’t think it was any good. She said she wouldn’t marry a man that just brought her a watermelon on Saturday. The grandmother said she would have done well to marry Mr. Teagarden because he was a gentleman and had bought Coca-Cola stock when it first came out and that he had died only a few years ago, a very wealthy man. They stopped at The Tower for barbecued sandwiches. The Tower was a part stucco and part wood filling station and dance hall set in a clearing outside of Timothy. A fat man named Red Sammy Butts ran it and there were signs stuck here and there on the building and for miles up and down the highway saying, TRY RED SAMMY’S FAMOUS BARBECUE. NONE LIKE FAMOUS RED SAMMY’S! RED SAM! THE FAT BOY WITH THE HAPPY LAUGH! A VETERAN! RED SAMMY’S YOUR MAN! Red Sammy was lying on the bare ground outside The Tower with his head under a truck while a gray monkey about a foot high, chained to a small chinaberry tree, chattered nearby. The monkey sprang back into the tree and got on the highest limb as soon as he saw the children jump out of the car and run toward him. Inside, The Tower was a long dark room with a counter at one end and tables at the other and dancing space in the middle. They all sat down at a board table next to the nickelodeon and Red Sam’s wife, a tall burnt-brown woman with hair and eyes lighter than her skin, came and took their order. The children’s mother put a dime in the machine and played “The Tennessee Waltz,” and the grandmother said that tune always made her want to dance. She asked Bailey if he would like to dance but he only glared at her. He didn’t have a naturally sunny disposition like she did and trips made him nervous. The grandmother’s brown eyes were very bright. She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her chair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children’s mother put in another dime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap routine. “Ain’t she cute?” Red Sam’s wife said, leaning over the counter. “Would you like to come be my little girl?” “No I certainly wouldn’t,” June Star said. “I wouldn’t live in a broken-down place like this for a million bucks!” and she ran back to the table. “Ain’t she cute?” the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely. “Aren’t you ashamed?” hissed the grandmother. Red Samcame in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with these people’s order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung over themlike a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table nearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. “You can’t win,” he said. “You can’t win,” and he wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. “These days you don’t know who to trust,” he said. “Ain’t that the truth?” “People are certainly not nice like they used to be,” said the grandmother. “Two fellers come in here last week,” Red Sammy said, “driving a Chrysler. It was a old beat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked at the mill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?” “Because you’re a good man!” the grandmother said at once. “Yes’m, I suppose so,” Red Samsaid as if he were struck with this answer. His wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in each hand and one balanced on her arm. “It isn’t a soul in this green world of God’s that you can trust,” she said. “And I don’t count nobody out of that, not nobody,” she repeated, looking at Red Sammy. “Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that’s escaped?” asked the grandmother. “I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if he didn’t attact this place right here,” said the woman. “If he hears about it being here, I wouldn’t be none surprised to see him. If he hears it’s two cent in the cash register, I wouldn’t be a tall surprised if he…” “That’ll do,” Red Sam said. “Go bring these people their Co’-Colas,” and the woman went off to get the rest of the order. “A good man is hard to find,” Red Sammy said. “Everything is getting terrible. I remember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.” He and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion Europe was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you would think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was exactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the lacy china-berry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully between his teeth as if it were a delicacy. They drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grandmother took cat naps and woke up every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled an old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady. She said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks leading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down with your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to it. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the more she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin arbors were still standing. “There was a secret panel in this house,” she said craftily, not telling the truth but wishing that she were, “and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in it when Sherman came through but it was never found…” “Hey!” John Wesley said. “Let’s go see it! We’ll find it! We’ll poke all the woodwork and find it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can’t we turn off there?” “We never have seen a house with a secret panel!” June Star shrieked. “Let’s go to the house with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can’t we go see the house with the secret panel!” “It’s not far from here, I know,” the grandmother said. “It wouldn’t take over twenty minutes.” Bailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said. The children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret panel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s shoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their vacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to screamand John Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his kidney. “All right!” he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. “Will you all shut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don’t shut up, we won’t go anywhere.” “It would be very educational for them,” the grandmother murmured. “All right,” Bailey said, “but get this: this is the only time we’re going to stop for anything like this. This is the one and only time.” “The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,” the grandmother directed. “I marked it when we passed.” “A dirt road,” Bailey groaned. After they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother recalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the candle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace. “You can’t go inside this house,” Bailey said. “You don’t know who lives there.” “While you all talk to the people in front, I’ll run around behind and get in a window,” John Wesley suggested. “We’ll all stay in the car,” his mother said. They turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust. The grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a day’s journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on dangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops of trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the dust-coated trees looking down on them. “This place had better turn up in a minute,” Bailey said, “or I’m going to turn around.” The road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months. “It’s not much farther,” the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought came to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes dilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise moved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing, the cat, sprang onto Bailey’s shoulder. The children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown out the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over once and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the driver’s seat with the cat—gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose—clinging to his neck like a caterpillar. As soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of the car, shouting, “We’ve had anACCIDENT!” The grandmother was curled up under the dashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey’s wrath would not come down on her all at once. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee. Bailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window against the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children’s mother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby, but she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the children screamed in a frenzy of delight. “But nobody’s killed,” June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped out of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty angle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the children, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking. “Maybe a car will come along,” said the children’s mother hoarsely. “I believe I have injured an organ,” said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one answered her. Bailey’s teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue parrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the shirt. The grandmother decided that she would not mention that the house was in Tennessee. The road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the other side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and deep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if the occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms dramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared around a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over. It was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it. It came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a steady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn’t speak. Then he turned his head and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black trousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved around on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose grin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low, hiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke. The driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was an older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silver-rimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn’t have on any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a black hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns. “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the children screamed. The grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she knew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known himall her life but she could not recall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment, placing his feet carefully so that he wouldn’t slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks, and his ankles were red and thin. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I see you all had you a little spill.” “We turned over twice!” said the grandmother. “Oncet,” he corrected. “We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,” he said quietly to the boy with the gray hat. “What you got that gun for?” John Wesley asked. “Whatcha gonna do with that gun?” “Lady,” the man said to the children’s mother, “would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there where you’re at.” “What are you telling US what to do for?” June Star asked. Behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. “Come here,” said their mother. “Look here now,” Bailey began suddenly, “we’re in a predicament! We’re in…” The grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. “You’re The Misfit!” she said. “I recognized you at once!” “Yes’m,” the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be known, “but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn’t of reckernized me.” Bailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the children. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened. “Lady,” he said, “don’t you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don’t mean. I don’t reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.” “You wouldn’t shoot a lady, would you?” the grandmother said and removed a clean handkerchief fromher cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it. The Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then covered it up again. “I would hate to have to,” he said. “Listen,” the grandmother almost screamed, “I know you’re a good man. You don’t look a bit like you have common blood. I know you must come from nice people!” “Yes mam,” he said, “finest people in the world.” When he smiled he showed a row of strong white teeth. “God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy’s heart was pure gold,” he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was standing with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. “Watch them children, Bobby Lee,” he said. “You know they make me nervous.” He looked at the six of them huddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn’t think of anything to say. “Ain’t a cloud in the sky,” he remarked, looking up at it. “Don’t see no sun but don’t see no cloud neither.” “Yes, it’s a beautiful day,” said the grandmother. “Listen,” she said, “you shouldn’t call yourself The Misfit because I know you’re a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell.” “Hush!” Bailey yelled. “Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!” He was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn’t move. “I pre-chate that, lady,” The Misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun. “It’ll take a half a hour to fix this here car,” Hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it. “Well, first you and Bobby Lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you,” The Misfit said, pointing to Bailey and John Wesley. “The boys want to ast you something,” he said to Bailey. “Would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?” “Listen,” Bailey began, “we’re in a terrible predicament! Nobody realizes what this is,” and his voice cracked. His eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained perfectly still. The grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. She stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on the ground. Hiram pulled Bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. John Wesley caught hold of his father’s hand and Bobby Lee followed. They went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, Bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, “I’ll be back in a minute, Mamma, wait on me!” “Come back this instant!” his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods. “Bailey Boy!” the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at The Misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. “I just know you’re a good man,” she said desperately. “You’re not a bit common!” “Nome, I ain’t a good man,” The Misfit said after a second as if he had considered her statement carefully, “but I ain’t the worst in the world neither. My daddy said I was a different breed of dog from my brothers and sisters. ‘You know,’ Daddy said, ‘it’s some that can live their whole life out without asking about it and it’s others has to know why it is, and this boy is one of the latters. He’s going to be into everything!’” He put on his black hat and looked up suddenly and then away deep into the woods as if he were embarrassed again. “I’m sorry I don’t have on a shirt before you ladies,” he said, hunching his shoulders slightly. “We buried our clothes that we had on when we escaped and we’re just making do until we can get better. We borrowed these from some folks we met,” he explained. “That’s perfectly all right,” the grandmother said. “Maybe Bailey has an extra shirt in his suitcase.” “I’ll look and see terrectly,” The Misfit said. “Where are they taking him?” the children’s mother screamed. “Daddy was a card himself,” The Misfit said. “You couldn’t put anything over on him. He never got in trouble with the Authorities though. Just had the knack of handling them.” “You could be honest too if you’d only try,” said the grandmother. “Think how wonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about somebody chasing you all the time.” The Misfit kept scratching in the ground with the butt of his gun as if he were thinking about it. “Yes’m, somebody is always after you,” he murmured. The grandmother noticed how thin his shoulder blades were just behind his hat because she was standing up looking down on him. “Do you ever pray?” she asked. He shook his head. All she saw was the black hat wiggle between his shoulder blades. “Nome,” he said. There was a pistol shot from the woods, followed closely by another. Then silence. The old lady’s head jerked around. She could hear the wind move through the tree tops like a long satisfied insuck of breath. “Bailey Boy!” she called. “I was a gospel singer for a while,” The Misfit said. “I been most everything. Been in the arm service, both land and sea, at home and abroad, been twict married, been an undertaker, been with the railroads, plowed Mother Earth, been in a tornado, seen a man burnt alive oncet,” and looked up at the children’s mother and the little girl who were sitting close together, their faces white and their eyes glassy; “I even seen a woman flogged,” he said. “Pray, pray,” the grandmother began, “pray, pray…” “I never was a bad boy that I remember of,” The Misfit said in an almost dreamy voice, “but somewheres along the line I done something wrong and got sent to the penitentiary. I was buried alive,” and he looked up and held her attention to himby a steady stare. “That’s when you should have started to pray,” she said. “What did you do to get sent to the penitentiary that first time?” “Turn to the right, it was a wall,” The Misfit said, looking up again at the cloudless sky. “Turn to the left, it was a wall. Look up it was a ceiling, look down it was a floor. I forget what I done, lady. I set there and set there, trying to remember what it was I done and I ain’t recalled it to this day. Oncet in a while, I would think it was coming to me, but it never come.” “Maybe they put you in by mistake,” the old lady said vaguely. “Nome,” he said. “It wasn’t no mistake. They had the papers on me.” “You must have stolen something,” she said. The Misfit sneered slightly. “Nobody had nothing I wanted,” he said. “It was a head-doctor at the penitentiary said what I had done was kill my daddy but I known that for a lie. My daddy died in nineteen ought nineteen of the epidemic flu and I never had a thing to do with it. He was buried in the Mount Hopewell Baptist churchyard and you can go there and see for yourself.” “If you would pray,” the old lady said, “Jesus would help you.” “That’s right,” The Misfit said. “Well then, why don’t you pray?” she asked trembling with delight suddenly. “I don’t want no hep,” he said. “I’mdoing all right by myself.” Bobby Lee and Hiram came ambling back from the woods. Bobby Lee was dragging a yellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it. “Thow me that shirt, Bobby Lee,” The Misfit said. The shirt came flying at him and landed on his shoulder and he put it on. The grandmother couldn’t name what the shirt reminded her of. “No, lady,” The Misfit said while he was buttoning it up, “I found out the crime don’t matter. You can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a tire off his car, because sooner or later you’re going to forget what it was you done and just be punished for it.” The children’s mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn’t get her breath. “Lady,” he asked, “would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with Bobby Lee and Hiramand join your husband?” “Yes, thank you,” the mother said faintly. Her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. “Hep that lady up, Hiram,” The Misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, “and Bobby Lee, you hold onto that little girl’s hand.” “I don’t want to hold hands with him,” June Star said. “He reminds me of a pig.” The fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods after Hiramand her mother. Alone with The Misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. There was not a cloud in the sky nor any sun. There was nothing around her but woods. She wanted to tell himthat he must pray. She opened and closed her mouth several times before anything came out. Finally she found herself saying, “Jesus, Jesus,” meaning, Jesus will help you, but the way she was saying it, it sounded as if she might be cursing. “Yes’m,” The Misfit said as if he agreed. “Jesus thown everything off balance. It was the same case with Him as with me except He hadn’t committed any crime and they could prove I had committed one because they had the papers on me. Of course,” he said, “they never shown me my papers. That’s why I sign myself now. I said long ago, you get you a signature and sign everything you do and keep a copy of it. Then you’ll know what you done and you can hold up the crime to the punishment and see do they match and in the end you’ll have something to prove you ain’t been treated right. I call myself The Misfit,” he said, “because I can’t make what all I done wrong fit what all I gone through in punishment.” There was a piercing scream from the woods, followed closely by a pistol report. “Does it seem right to you, lady, that one is punished a heap and another ain’t punished at all?” “Jesus!” the old lady cried. “You’ve got good blood! I know you wouldn’t shoot a lady! I know you come from nice people! Pray! Jesus, you ought not to shoot a lady. I’ll give you all the money I’ve got!” “Lady,” The Misfit said, looking beyond her far into the woods, “there never was a body that give the undertaker a tip.” There were two more pistol reports and the grandmother raised her head like a parched old turkey hen crying for water and called, “Bailey Boy, Bailey Boy!” as if her heart would break. “Jesus was the only One that ever raised the dead.” The Misfit continued, “and He shouldn’t have done it. He thrown everything off balance. If He did what He said, then it’s nothing for you to do but throw away everything and follow Him, and if He didn’t, then it’s nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can—by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. No pleasure but meanness,” he said and his voice had become almost a snarl. “Maybe He didn’t raise the dead,” the old lady mumbled, not knowing what she was saying and feeling so dizzy that she sank down in the ditch with her legs twisted under her. “I wasn’t there so I can’t say He didn’t,” The Misfit said. “I wisht I had of been there,” he said, hitting the ground with his fist. “It ain’t right I wasn’t there because if I had of been there I would of known. Listen lady,” he said in a high voice, “if I had of been there I would of known and I wouldn’t be like I am now.” His voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother’s head cleared for an instant. She saw the man’s face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured, “Why you’re one of my babies. You’re one of my own children!” She reached out and touched him on the shoulder. The Misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. Then he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to clean them. Hiram and Bobby Lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down at the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under her like a child’s and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky. Without his glasses, The Misfit’s eyes were red-rimmed and pale and defenseless-looking. “Take her off and throw her where you thrown the others,” he said, picking up the cat that was rubbing itself against his leg. “She was a talker, wasn’t she?” Bobby Lee said, sliding down the ditch with a yodel. “She would of been a good woman,” The Misfit said, “if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.” “Some fun!” Bobby Lee said. “Shut up, Bobby Lee,” The Misfit said. “It’s no real pleasure in life.” A Late Encounter with the Enemy GENERAL SASH was a hundred and four years old. He lived with his granddaughter, Sally Poker Sash, who was sixty-two years old and who prayed every night on her knees that he would live until her graduation from college. The General didn’t give two slaps for her graduation but he never doubted he would live for it. Living had got to be such a habit with him that he couldn’t conceive of any other condition. A graduation exercise was not exactly his idea of a good time, even if, as she said, he would be expected to sit on the stage in his uniform. She said there would be a long procession of teachers and students in their robes but that there wouldn’t be anything to equal him in his uniform. He knew this well enough without her telling him, and as for the damn procession, it could march to hell and back and not cause him a quiver. He liked parades with floats full of Miss Americas and Miss Daytona Beaches and Miss Queen Cotton Products. He didn’t have any use for processions and a procession full of schoolteachers was about as deadly as the River Styx to his way of thinking. However, he was willing to sit on the stage in his uniformso that they could see him. Sally Poker was not as sure as he was that he would live until her graduation. There had not been any perceptible change in him for the last five years, but she had the sense that she might be cheated out of her triumph because she so often was. She had been going to summer school every year for the past twenty because when she started teaching, there were no such things as degrees. In those times, she said, everything was normal but nothing had been normal since she was sixteen, and for the past twenty summers, when she should have been resting, she had had to take a trunk in the burning heat to the state teacher’s college; and though when she returned in the fall, she always taught in the exact way she had been taught not to teach, this was a mild revenge that didn’t satisfy her sense of justice. She wanted the General at her graduation because she wanted to show what she stood for, or, as she said, “what all was behind her,” and was not behind them. This them was not anybody in particular. It was just all the upstarts who had turned the world on its head and unsettled the ways of decent living. She meant to stand on that platform in August with the General sitting in his wheel chair on the stage behind her and she meant to hold her head very high as if she were saying, “See him! See him! My kin, all you upstarts! Glorious upright old man standing for the old traditions! Dignity! Honor! Courage! See him!” One night in her sleep she screamed, “See him! See him!” and turned her head and found him sitting in his wheel chair behind her with a terrible expression on his face and with all his clothes off except the general’s hat and she had waked up and had not dared to go back to sleep again that night. For his part, the General would not have consented even to attend her graduation if she had not promised to see to it that he sit on the stage. He liked to sit on any stage. He considered that he was still a very handsome man. When he had been able to stand up, he had measured five feet four inches of pure game cock. He had white hair that reached to his shoulders behind and he would not wear teeth because he thought his profile was more striking without them. When he put on his full-dress general’s uniform, he knew well enough that there was nothing to match himanywhere. This was not the same uniform he had worn in the War between the States. He had not actually been a general in that war. He had probably been a foot soldier; he didn’t remember what he had been; in fact, he didn’t remember that war at all. It was like his feet, which hung down now shriveled at the very end of him, without feeling, covered with a blue-gray afghan that Sally Poker had crocheted when she was a little girl. He didn’t remember the Spanish-American War in which he had lost a son; he didn’t even remember the son. He didn’t have any use for history because he never expected to meet it again. To his mind, history was connected with processions and life with parades and he liked parades. People were always asking him if he remembered this or that—a dreary black procession of questions about the past. There was only one event in the past that had any significance for him and that he cared to talk about: that was twelve years ago when he had received the general’s uniformand had been in the premiere. “I was in that preemy they had in Atlanta,” he would tell visitors sitting on his front porch. “Surrounded by beautiful guls. It wasn’t a thing local about it. It was nothing local about it. Listen here. It was a nashnul event and they had me in it— up onto the stage. There was no bob-tails at it. Every person at it had paid ten dollars to get in and had to wear his tuxseeder. I was in this uniform. A beautiful gul presented me with it that afternoon in a hotel room.” “It was in a suite in the hotel and I was in it too, Papa,” Sally Poker would say, winking at the visitors. “You weren’t alone with any young lady in a hotel room.” “Was, I’d a known what to do,” the old General would say with a sharp look and the visitors would scream with laughter. “This was a Hollywood, California, gul,” he’d continue. “She was from Hollywood, California, and didn’t have any part in the pitcher. Out there they have so many beautiful guls that they don’t need that they call them a extra and they don’t use them for nothing but presenting people with things and having their pitchers taken. They took my pitcher with her. No, it was two of them. One on either side and me in the middle with my arms around each of them’s waist and their waist ain’t any bigger than a half a dollar.” Sally Poker would interrupt again. “It was Mr. Govisky that gave you the uniform, Papa, and he gave me the most exquisite corsage. Really, I wish you could have seen it. It was made with gladiola petals taken off and painted gold and put back together to look like a rose. It was exquisite. I wish you could have seen it, it was…” “It was as big as her head,” the General would snarl. “I was tellin it. They gimme this uniform and they gimme this soward and they say, ‘Now General, we don’t want you to start a war on us. All we want you to do is march right up on that stage when you’re innerduced tonight and answer a few questions. Think you can do that?’ ‘Think I can do it!’ I say. ‘Listen here. I was doing things before you were born,’ and they hollered.” “He was the hit of the show,” Sally Poker would say, but she didn’t much like to remember the premiere on account of what had happened to her feet at it. She had bought a new dress for the occasion—a long black crepe dinner dress with a rhinestone buckle and a bolero—and a pair of silver slippers to wear with it, because she was supposed to go up on the stage with himto keep himfromfalling. Everything was arranged for them. A real limousine came at ten minutes to eight and took themto the theater. It drew up under the marquee at exactly the right time, after the big stars and the director and the author and the governor and the mayor and some less important stars. The police kept traffic from jamming and there were ropes to keep the people off who couldn’t go. All the people who couldn’t go watched them step out of the limousine into the lights. Then they walked down the red and gold foyer and an usherette in a Confederate cap and little short skirt conducted themto their special seats. The audience was already there and a group of UDC members began to clap when they saw the General in his uniform and that started everybody to clap. A few more celebrities came after them and then the doors closed and the lights went down. A young man with blond wavy hair who said he represented the motionpicture industry came out and began to introduce everybody and each one who was introduced walked up on the stage and said how really happy he was to be here for this great event. The General and his granddaughter were introduced sixteenth on the program. He was introduced as General Tennessee Flintrock Sash of the Confederacy, though Sally Poker had told Mr. Govisky that his name was George Poker Sash and that he had only been a major. She helped him up from his seat but her heart was beating so fast she didn’t know whether she’d make it herself. The old man walked up the aisle slowly with his fierce white head high and his hat held over his heart. The orchestra began to play the Confederate Battle Hymn very softly and the UDC members rose as a group and did not sit down again until the General was on the stage. When he reached the center of the stage with Sally Poker just behind him guiding his elbow, the orchestra burst out in a loud rendition of the Battle Hymn and the old man, with real stage presence, gave a vigorous trembling salute and stood at attention until the last blast had died away. Two of the usherettes in Confederate caps and short skirts held a Confederate and a Union flag crossed behind them. The General stood in the exact center of the spotlight and it caught a weird moon-shaped slice of Sally Poker—the corsage, the rhinestone buckle and one hand clenched around a white glove and handkerchief. The young man with the blond wavy hair inserted himself into the circle of light and said he was really happy to have here tonight for this great event, one, he said, who had fought and bled in the battles they would soon see daringly reacted on the screen, and “Tell me, General,” he asked, “how old are you?” “Niiiiiinnttty-two!” the General screamed. The young man looked as if this were just about the most impressive thing that had been said all evening. “Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, “let’s give the General the biggest hand we’ve got!” and there was applause immediately and the young man indicated to Sally Poker with a motion of his thumb that she could take the old man back to his seat now so that the next person could be introduced; but the General had not finished. He stood immovable in the exact center of the spotlight, his neck thrust forward, his mouth slightly open, and his voracious gray eyes drinking in the glare and the applause. He elbowed his granddaughter roughly away. “How I keep so young,” he screeched, “I kiss all the pretty guls!” This was met with a great din of spontaneous applause and it was at just that instant that Sally Poker looked down at her feet and discovered that in the excitement of getting ready she had forgotten to change her shoes: two brown Girl Scout oxfords protruded fromthe bottomof her dress. She gave the General a yank and almost ran with him off the stage. He was very angry that he had not got to say how glad he was to be here for this event and on the way back to his seat, he kept saying as loud as he could, “I’m glad to be here at this preemy with all these beautiful guls!” but there was another celebrity going up the other aisle and nobody paid any attention to him. He slept through the picture, muttering fiercely every now and then in his sleep. Since then, his life had not been very interesting. His feet were completely dead now, his knees worked like old hinges, his kidneys functioned when they would, but his heart persisted doggedly to beat. The past and the future were the same thing to him, one forgotten and the other not remembered; he had no more notion of dying than a cat. Every year on Confederate Memorial Day, he was bundled up and lent to the Capitol City Museum where he was displayed from one to four in a musty room full of old photographs, old uniforms, old artillery, and historic documents. All these were carefully preserved in glass cases so that children would not put their hands on them. He wore his general’s uniform from the premiere and sat, with a fixed scowl, inside a small roped area. There was nothing about him to indicate that he was alive except an occasional movement in his milky gray eyes, but once when a bold child touched his sword, his arm shot forward and slapped the hand off in an instant. In the spring when the old homes were opened for pilgrimages, he was invited to wear his uniform and sit in some conspicuous spot and lend atmosphere to the scene. Some of these times he only snarled at the visitors but sometimes he told about the premiere and the beautiful girls. If he had died before Sally Poker’s graduation, she thought she would have died herself. At the beginning of the summer term, even before she knew if she would pass, she told the Dean that her grandfather, General Tennessee Flintrock Sash of the Confederacy, would attend her graduation and that he was a hundred and four years old and that his mind was still clear as a bell. Distinguished visitors were always welcome and could sit on the stage and be introduced. She made arrangements with her nephew, John Wesley Poker Sash, a Boy Scout, to come wheel the General’s chair. She thought how sweet it would be to see the old man in his courageous gray and the young boy in his clean khaki—the old and the new, she thought appropriately—they would be behind her on the stage when she received her degree. Everything went almost exactly as she had planned. In the summer while she was away at school, the General stayed with other relatives and they brought him and John Wesley, the Boy Scout, down to the graduation. A reporter came to the hotel where they stayed and took the General’s picture with Sally Poker on one side of him and John Wesley on the other. The General, who had had his picture taken with beautiful girls, didn’t think much of this. He had forgotten precisely what kind of event this was he was going to attend but he remembered that he was to wear his uniformand carry the sword. On the morning of the graduation, Sally Poker had to line up in the academic procession with the B.S.’s in Elementary Education and she couldn’t see to getting him on the stage herself—but John Wesley, a fat blond boy of ten with an executive expression, guaranteed to take care of everything. She came in her academic gown to the hotel and dressed the old man in his uniform. He was as frail as a dried spider. “Aren’t you just thrilled, Papa?” she asked. “I’m just thrilled to death!” “Put the soward acrost my lap, damm you,” the old man said, “where it’ll shine.” She put it there and then stood back looking at him. “You look just grand,” she said. “God damm it,” the old man said in a slow monotonous certain tone as if he were saying it to the beating of his heart. “God dammevery goddamthing to hell.” “Now, now,” she said and left happily to join the procession. The graduates were lined up behind the Science building and she found her place just as the line started to move. She had not slept much the night before and when she had, she had dreamed of the exercises, murmuring, “See him, see him?” in her sleep but waking up every time just before she turned her head to look at him behind her. The graduates had to walk three blocks in the hot sun in their black wool robes and as she plodded stolidly along she thought that if anyone considered this academic procession something impressive to behold, they need only wait until they saw that old General in his courageous gray and that clean young Boy Scout stoutly wheeling his chair across the stage with the sunlight catching the sword. She imagined that John Wesley had the old man ready now behind the stage. The black procession wound its way up the two blocks and started on the main walk leading to the auditorium. The visitors stood on the grass, picking out their graduates. Men were pushing back their hats and wiping their foreheads and women were lifting their dresses slightly from the shoulders to keep them from sticking to their backs. The graduates in their heavy robes looked as if the last beads of ignorance were being sweated out of them. The sun blazed off the fenders of automobiles and beat from the columns of the buildings and pulled the eye from one spot of glare to another. It pulled Sally Poker’s toward the big red Coca-Cola machine that had been set up by the side of the auditorium. Here she saw the General parked, scowling and hatless in his chair in the blazing sun while John Wesley, his blouse loose behind, his hip and cheek pressed to the red machine, was drinking a Coca-Cola. She broke from the line and galloped to them and snatched the bottle away. She shook the boy and thrust in his blouse and put the hat on the old man’s head. “Now get him in there!” she said, pointing one rigid finger to the side door of the building. For his part the General felt as if there were a little hole beginning to widen in the top of his head. The boy wheeled him rapidly down a walk and up a ramp and into a building and bumped him over the stage entrance and into position where he had been told and the General glared in front of him at heads that all seemed to flow together and eyes that moved from one face to another. Several figures in black robes came and picked up his hand and shook it. A black procession was flowing up each aisle and forming to stately music in a pool in front of him. The music seemed to be entering his head through the little hole and he thought for a second that the procession would try to enter it too. He didn’t know what procession this was but there was something familiar about it. It must be familiar to himsince it had come to meet him, but he didn’t like a black procession. Any procession that came to meet him, he thought irritably, ought to have floats with beautiful guls on themlike the floats before the preemy. It must be something connected with history like they were always having. He had no use for any of it. What happened then wasn’t anything to a man living now and he was living now. When all the procession had flowed into the black pool, a black figure began orating in front of it. The figure was telling something about history and the General made up his mind he wouldn’t listen, but the words kept seeping in through the little hole in his head. He heard his own name mentioned and his chair was shuttled forward roughly and the Boy Scout took a big bow. They called his name and the fat brat bowed. Goddam you, the old man tried to say, get out of my way, I can stand up!—but he was jerked back again before he could get up and take the bow. He supposed the noise they made was for him. If he was over, he didn’t intend to listen to any more of it. If it hadn’t been for the little hole in the top of his head, none of the words would have got to him. He thought of putting his finger up there into the hole to block them but the hole was a little wider than his finger and it felt as if it were getting deeper. Another black robe had taken the place of the first one and was talking now and he heard his name mentioned again but they were not talking about him, they were still talking about history. “If we forget our past,” the speaker was saying, “we won’t remember our future and it will be as well for we won’t have one.” The General heard some of these words gradually. He had forgotten history and he didn’t intend to remember it again. He had forgotten the name and face of his wife and the names and faces of his children or even if he had a wife and children, and he had forgotten the names of places and the places themselves and what had happened at them. He was considerably irked by the hole in his head. He had not expected to have a hole in his head at this event. It was the slow black music that had put it there and though most of the music had stopped outside, there was still a little of it in the hole, going deeper and moving around in his thoughts, letting the words he heard into the dark places of his brain. He heard the words, Chickamauga, Shiloh, Johnston, Lee, and he knew he was inspiring all these words that meant nothing to him. He wondered if he had been a general at Chickamauga or at Lee. Then he tried to see himself and the horse mounted in the middle of a float full of beautiful girls, being driven slowly through downtown Atlanta. Instead, the old words began to stir in his head as if they were trying to wrench themselves out of place and come to life. The speaker was through with that war and had gone on to the next one and now he was approaching another and all his words, like the black procession, were vaguely familiar and irritating. There was a long finger of music in the General’s head, probing various spots that were words, letting in a little light on the words and helping them to live. The words began to come toward him and he said, Dammit! I ain’t going to have it! and he started edging backwards to get out of the way. Then he saw the figure in the black robe sit down and there was a noise and the black pool in front of him began to rumble and to flow toward him from either side to the black slow music, and he said, Stop dammit! I can’t do but one thing at a time! He couldn’t protect himself from the words and attend to the procession too and the words were coming at him fast. He felt that he was running backwards and the words were coming at him like musket fire, just escaping him but getting nearer and nearer. He turned around and began to run as fast as he could but he found himself running toward the words. He was running into a regular volley of them and meeting them with quick curses. As the music swelled toward him, the entire past opened up on him out of nowhere and he felt his body riddled in a hundred places with sharp stabs of pain and he fell down, returning a curse for every hit. He saw his wife’s narrow face looking at him critically through her round gold-rimmed glasses; he saw one of his squinting bald-headed sons; and his mother ran toward him with an anxious look; then a succession of places—Chickamauga, Shiloh, Marthasville—rushed at himas if the past were the only future now and he had to endure it. Then suddenly he saw that the black procession was almost on him. He recognized it, for it had been dogging all his days. He made such a desperate effort to see over it and find out what comes after the past that his hand clenched the sword until the blade touched bone. The graduates were crossing the stage in a long file to receive their scrolls and shake the president’s hand. As Sally Poker, who was near the end, crossed, she glanced at the General and saw him sitting fixed and fierce, his eyes wide open, and she turned her head forward again and held it a perceptible degree higher and received her scroll. Once it was all over and she was out of the auditorium in the sun again, she located her kin and they waited together on a bench in the shade for John Wesley to wheel the old man out. That crafty scout had bumped him out the back way and rolled him at high speed down a flagstone path and was waiting now, with the corpse, in the long line at the Coca-Cola machine.
BESIDES the neutral expression that she wore when she was alone, Mrs. Freeman had two others, forward and reverse, that she used for all her human dealings. Her forward expression was steady and driving like the advance of a heavy truck. Her eyes never swerved to left or right but turned as the story turned as if they followed a yellow line down the center of it. She seldom used the other expression because it was not often necessary for her to retract a statement, but when she did, her face came to a complete stop, there was an almost imperceptible movement of her black eyes, during which they seemed to be receding, and then the observer would see that Mrs. Freeman, though she might stand there as real as several grain sacks thrown on top of each other, was no longer there in spirit. As for getting anything across to her when this was the case, Mrs. Hopewell had given it up. She might talk her head off. Mrs. Freeman could never be brought to admit herself wrong on any point. She would stand there and if she could be brought to say anything, it was something like, “Well, I wouldn’t of said it was and I wouldn’t of said it wasn’t,” or letting her gaze range over the top kitchen shelf where there was an assortment of dusty bottles, she might remark, “I see you ain’t ate many of themfigs you put up last summer.” They carried on their most important business in the kitchen at breakfast. Every morning Mrs. Hopewell got up at seven o’clock and lit her gas heater and Joy’s. Joy was her daughter, a large blonde girl who had an artificial leg. Mrs. Hopewell thought of her as a child though she was thirty-two years old and highly educated. Joy would get up while her mother was eating and lumber into the bathroom and slam the door, and before long, Mrs. Freeman would arrive at the back door. Joy would hear her mother call, “Come on in,” and then they would talk for a while in low voices that were indistinguishable in the bathroom. By the time Joy came in, they had usually finished the weather report and were on one or the other of Mrs. Freeman’s daughters, Glynese or Carramae, Joy called them Glycerin and Caramel. Glynese, a redhead, was eighteen and had many admirers; Carramae, a blonde, was only fifteen but already married and pregnant. She could not keep anything on her stomach. Every morning Mrs. Freeman told Mrs. Hopewell how many times she had vomited since the last report. Mrs. Hopewell liked to tell people that Glynese and Carramae were two of the finest girls she knew and that Mrs. Freeman was a lady and that she was never ashamed to take her anywhere or introduce her to anybody they might meet. Then she would tell how she had happened to hire the Freemans in the first place and how they were a godsend to her and how she had had them four years. The reason for her keeping themso long was that they were not trash. They were good country people. She had telephoned the man whose name they had given as a reference and he had told her that Mr. Freeman was a good farmer but that his wife was the nosiest woman ever to walk the earth. “She’s got to be into everything,” the man said. “If she don’t get there before the dust settles, you can bet she’s dead, that’s all. She’ll want to know all your business. I can stand himreal good,” he had said, “but me nor my wife neither could have stood that woman one more minute on this place.” That had put Mrs. Hopewell off for a few days. She had hired them in the end because there were no other applicants but she had made up her mind beforehand exactly how she would handle the woman. Since she was the type who had to be into everything, then, Mrs. Hopewell had decided, she would not only let her be into everything, she would see to it that she was into everything—she would give her the responsibility of everything, she would put her in charge. Mrs. Hopewell had no bad qualities of her own but she was able to use other people’s in such a constructive way that she never felt the lack. She had hired the Freemans and she had kept themfour years. Nothing is perfect. This was one of Mrs. Hopewell’s favorite sayings. Another was: that is life! And still another, the most important, was: well, other people have their opinions too. She would make these statements, usually at the table, in a tone of gentle insistence as if no one held them but her, and the large hulking Joy, whose constant outrage had obliterated every expression from her face, would stare just a little to the side of her, her eyes icy blue, with the look of someone who has achieved blindness by an act of will and means to keep it. When Mrs. Hopewell said to Mrs. Freeman that life was like that, Mrs. Freeman would say, “I always said so myself.” Nothing had been arrived at by anyone that had not first been arrived at by her. She was quicker than Mr. Freeman. When Mrs. Hopewell said to her after they had been on the place a while, “You know, you’re the wheel behind the wheel,” and winked, Mrs. Freeman had said, “I know it. I’ve always been quick. It’s some that are quicker than others.” “Everybody is different,” Mrs. Hopewell said. “Yes, most people is,” Mrs. Freeman said. “It takes all kinds to make the world.” “I always said it did myself.” The girl was used to this kind of dialogue for breakfast and more of it for dinner; sometimes they had it for supper too. When they had no guest they ate in the kitchen because that was easier. Mrs. Freeman always managed to arrive at some point during the meal and to watch them finish it. She would stand in the doorway if it were summer but in the winter she would stand with one elbow on top of the refrigerator and look down on them, or she would stand by the gas heater, lifting the back of her skirt slightly. Occasionally she would stand against the wall and roll her head from side to side. At no time was she in any hurry to leave. All this was very trying on Mrs. Hopewell but she was a woman of great patience. She realized that nothing is perfect and that in the Freemans she had good country people and that if, in this day and age, you get good country people, you had better hang onto them. She had had plenty of experience with trash. Before the Freemans she had averaged one tenant family a year. The wives of these farmers were not the kind you would want to be around you for very long. Mrs. Hopewell, who had divorced her husband long ago, needed someone to walk over the fields with her; and when Joy had to be impressed for these services, her remarks were usually so ugly and her face so glum that Mrs. Hopewell would say, “If you can’t come pleasantly, I don’t want you at all,” to which the girl, standing square and rigidshouldered with her neck thrust slightly forward, would reply, “If you want me, here I am—LIKE I AM.” Mrs. Hopewell excused this attitude because of the leg (which had been shot off in a hunting accident when Joy was ten). It was hard for Mrs. Hopewell to realize that her child was thirty-two now and that for more than twenty years she had had only one leg. She thought of her still as a child because it tore her heart to think instead of the poor stout girl in her thirties who had never danced a step or had any normal good times. Her name was really Joy but as soon as she was twenty-one and away from home, she had had it legally changed. Mrs. Hopewell was certain that she had thought and thought until she had hit upon the ugliest name in any language. Then she had gone and had the beautiful name, Joy, changed without telling her mother until after she had done it. Her legal name was Hulga. When Mrs. Hopewell thought the name, Hulga, she thought of the broad blank hull of a battleship. She would not use it. She continued to call her Joy to which the girl responded but in a purely mechanical way. Hulga had learned to tolerate Mrs. Freeman who saved her from taking walks with her mother. Even Glynese and Carramae were useful when they occupied attention that might otherwise have been directed at her. At first she had thought she could not stand Mrs. Freeman for she had found that it was not possible to be rude to her. Mrs. Freeman would take on strange resentments and for days together she would be sullen but the source of her displeasure was always obscure; a direct attack, a positive leer, blatant ugliness to her face—these never touched her. And without warning one day, she began calling her Hulga. She did not call her that in front of Mrs. Hopewell who would have been incensed but when she and the girl happened to be out of the house together, she would say something and add the name Hulga to the end of it, and the big spectacled Joy-Hulga would scowl and redden as if her privacy had been intruded upon. She considered the name her personal affair. She had arrived at it first purely on the basis of its ugly sound and then the full genius of its fitness had struck her. She had a vision of the name working like the ugly sweating Vulcan who stayed in the furnace and to whom, presumably, the goddess had to come when called. She saw it as the name of her highest creative act. One of her major triumphs was that her mother had not been able to turn her dust into Joy, but the greater one was that she had been able to turn it herself into Hulga. However, Mrs. Freeman’s relish for using the name only irritated her. It was as if Mrs. Freeman’s beady steel-pointed eyes had penetrated far enough behind her face to reach some secret fact. Something about her seemed to fascinate Mrs. Freeman and then one day Hulga realized that it was the artificial leg. Mrs. Freeman had a special fondness for the details of secret infections, hidden deformities, assaults upon children. Of diseases, she preferred the lingering or incurable. Hulga had heard Mrs. Hopewell give her the details of the hunting accident, how the leg had been literally blasted off, how she had never lost consciousness. Mrs. Freeman could listen to it any time as if it had happened an hour ago. When Hulga stumped into the kitchen in the morning (she could walk without making the awful noise but she made it—Mrs. Hopewell was certain—because it was ugly-sounding), she glanced at them and did not speak. Mrs. Hopewell would be in her red kimono with her hair tied around her head in rags. She would be sitting at the table, finishing her breakfast and Mrs. Freeman would be hanging by her elbow outward from the refrigerator, looking down at the table. Hulga always put her eggs on the stove to boil and then stood over them with her arms folded, and Mrs. Hopewell would look at her—a kind of indirect gaze divided between her and Mrs. Freeman—and would think that if she would only keep herself up a little, she wouldn’t be so bad looking. There was nothing wrong with her face that a pleasant expression wouldn’t help. Mrs. Hopewell said that people who looked on the bright side of things would be beautiful even if they were not. Whenever she looked at Joy this way, she could not help but feel that it would have been better if the child had not taken the Ph.D. It had certainly not brought her out any and now that she had it, there was no more excuse for her to go to school again. Mrs. Hopewell thought it was nice for girls to go to school to have a good time but Joy had “gone through.” Anyhow, she would not have been strong enough to go again. The doctors had told Mrs. Hopewell that with the best of care, Joy might see forty-five. She had a weak heart. Joy had made it plain that if it had not been for this condition, she would be far from these red hills and good country people. She would be in a university lecturing to people who knew what she was talking about. And Mrs. Hopewell could very well picture her there, looking like a scarecrow and lecturing to more of the same. Here she went about all day in a six-year-old skirt and a yellow sweat shirt with a faded cowboy on a horse embossed on it. She thought this was funny; Mrs. Hopewell thought it was idiotic and showed simply that she was still a child. She was brilliant but she didn’t have a grain of sense. It seemed to Mrs. Hopewell that every year she grew less like other people and more like herself—bloated, rude, and squint-eyed. And she said such strange things! To her own mother she had said—without warning, without excuse, standing up in the middle of a meal with her face purple and her mouth half full—“Woman! do you ever look inside? Do you ever look inside and see what you are not? God!” she had cried sinking down again and staring at her plate, “Malebranche was right: we are not our own light. We are not our own light!” Mrs. Hopewell had no idea to this day what brought that on. She had only made the remark, hoping Joy would take it in, that a smile never hurt anyone. The girl had taken the Ph.D. in philosophy and this left Mrs. Hopewell at a complete loss. You could say, “My daughter is a nurse,” or “My daughter is a schoolteacher,” or even, “My daughter is a chemical engineer.” You could not say, “My daughter is a philosopher.” That was something that had ended with the Greeks and Romans. All day Joy sat on her neck in a deep chair, reading. Sometimes she went for walks but she didn’t like dogs or cats or birds or flowers or nature or nice young men. She looked at nice young men as if she could smell their stupidity. One day Mrs. Hopewell had picked up one of the books the girl had just put down and opening it at random, she read, “Science, on the other hand, has to assert its soberness and seriousness afresh and declare that it is concerned solely with what-is. Nothing—how can it be for science anything but a horror and a phantasm? If science is right, then one thing stands firm: science wishes to know nothing of nothing. Such is after all the strictly scientific approach to Nothing. We know it by wishing to know nothing of Nothing.” These words had been underlined with a blue pencil and they worked on Mrs. Hopewell like some evil incantation in gibberish. She shut the book quickly and went out of the room as if she were having a chill. This morning when the girl came in, Mrs. Freeman was on Carramae. “She thrown up four times after supper,” she said, “and was up twict in the night after three o’clock. Yesterday she didn’t do nothing but ramble in the bureau drawer. All she did. Stand up there and see what she could run up on.” “She’s got to eat,” Mrs. Hopewell muttered, sipping her coffee, while she watched Joy’s back at the stove. She was wondering what the child had said to the Bible salesman. She could not imagine what kind of a conversation she could possibly have had with him. He was a tall gaunt hatless youth who had called yesterday to sell them a Bible. He had appeared at the door, carrying a large black suitcase that weighted him so heavily on one side that he had to brace himself against the door facing. He seemed on the point of collapse but he said in a cheerful voice. “Good morning, Mrs. Cedars!” and set the suitcase down on the mat. He was not a bad-looking young man though he had on a bright blue suit and yellow socks that were not pulled up far enough. He had prominent face bones and a streak of sticky-looking brown hair falling across his forehead. “I’m Mrs. Hopewell,” she said. “Oh!” he said, pretending to look puzzled but with his eyes sparkling, “I saw it said ‘The Cedars’ on the mailbox so I thought you was Mrs. Cedars!” and he burst out in a pleasant laugh. He picked up the satchel and under cover of a pant, he fell forward into her hall. It was rather as if the suitcase had moved first, jerking him after it. “Mrs. Hopewell!” he said and grabbed her hand. “I hope you are well!” and he laughed again and then all at once his face sobered completely. He paused and gave her a straight earnest look and said, “Lady, I’ve come to speak of serious things.” “Well, come in,” she muttered, none too pleased because her dinner was almost ready. He came into the parlor and sat down on the edge of a straight chair and put the suitcase between his feet and glanced around the room as if he were sizing her up by it. Her silver gleamed on the two sideboards; she decided he had never been in a roomas elegant as this. “Mrs. Hopewell,” he began, using her name in a way that sounded almost intimate, “I know you believe in Chrustian service.” “Well yes,” she murmured. “I know,” he said and paused, looking very wise with his head cocked on one side, “that you’re a good woman. Friends have told me.” Mrs. Hopewell never liked to be taken for a fool. “What are you selling?” she asked. “Bibles,” the young man said and his eye raced around the room before he added, “I see you have no family Bible in your parlor, I see that is the one lack you got!” Mrs. Hopewell could not say, “My daughter is an atheist and won’t let me keep the Bible in the parlor.” She said, stiffening slightly, “I keep my Bible by my bedside.” This was not the truth. It was in the attic somewhere. “Lady,” he said, “the word of God ought to be in the parlor.” “Well, I think that’s a matter of taste,” she began. “I think…” “Lady,” he said, “for a Chrustian, the word of God ought to be in every room in the house besides in his heart. I know you’re a Chrustian because I can see it in every line of your face.” She stood up and said, “Well, young man, I don’t want to buy a Bible and I smell my dinner burning.” He didn’t get up. He began to twist his hands and looking down at them, he said softly, “Well lady, I’ll tell you the truth—not many people want to buy one nowadays and besides, I know I’m real simple. I don’t know how to say a thing but to say it. I’m just a country boy.” He glanced up into her unfriendly face. “People like you don’t like to fool with country people like me!” “Why!” she cried, “good country people are the salt of the earth! Besides, we all have different ways of doing, it takes all kinds to make the world go ’round. That’s life!” “You said a mouthful,” he said. “Why, I think there aren’t enough good country people in the world!” she said, stirred. “I think that’s what’s wrong with it!” His face had brightened. “I didn’t inraduce myself,” he said. “I’m Manley Pointer from out in the country around Willohobie, not even from a place, just fromnear a place.” “You wait a minute,” she said. “I have to see about my dinner.” She went out to the kitchen and found Joy standing near the door where she had been listening. “Get rid of the salt of the earth,” she said, “and let’s eat.” Mrs. Hopewell gave her a pained look and turned the heat down under the vegetables. “I can’t be rude to anybody,” she murmured and went back into the parlor. He had opened the suitcase and was sitting with a Bible on each knee. “You might as well put those up,” she told him. “I don’t want one.” “I appreciate your honesty,” he said. “You don’t see any more real honest people unless you go way out in the country.” “I know,” she said, “real genuine folks!” Through the crack in the door she heard a groan. “I guess a lot of boys come telling you they’re working their way through college,” he said, “but I’m not going to tell you that. Somehow,” he said, “I don’t want to go to college. I want to devote my life to Chrustian service. See,” he said, lowering his voice, “I got this heart condition. I may not live long. When you know it’s something wrong with you and you may not live long, well then, lady…” He paused, with his mouth open, and stared at her. He and Joy had the same condition! She knew that her eyes were filling with tears but she collected herself quickly and murmured, “Won’t you stay for dinner? We’d love to have you!” and was sorry the instant she heard herself say it. “Yes mam,” he said in an abashed voice, “I would sher love to do that!” Joy had given him one look on being introduced to him and then throughout the meal had not glanced at him again. He had addressed several remarks to her, which she had pretended not to hear. Mrs. Hopewell could not understand deliberate rudeness, although she lived with it, and she felt she had always to overflow with hospitality to make up for Joy’s lack of courtesy. She urged him to talk about himself and he did. He said he was the seventh child of twelve and that his father had been crushed under a tree when he himself was eight year old. He had been crushed very badly, in fact, almost cut in two and was practically not recognizable. His mother had got along the best she could by hard working and she had always seen that her children went to Sunday School and that they read the Bible every evening. He was now nineteen year old and he had been selling Bibles for four months. In that time he had sold seventy-seven Bibles and had the promise of two more sales. He wanted to become a missionary because he thought that was the way you could do most for people. “He who losest his life shall find it,” he said simply and he was so sincere, so genuine and earnest that Mrs. Hopewell would not for the world have smiled. He prevented his peas from sliding onto the table by blocking them with a piece of bread which he later cleaned his plate with. She could see Joy observing sidewise how he handled his knife and fork and she saw too that every few minutes, the boy would dart a keen appraising glance at the girl as if he were trying to attract her attention. After dinner Joy cleared the dishes off the table and disappeared and Mrs. Hopewell was left to talk with him. He told her again about his childhood and his father’s accident and about various things that had happened to him. Every five minutes or so she would stifle a yawn. He sat for two hours until finally she told him she must go because she had an appointment in town. He packed his Bibles and thanked her and prepared to leave, but in the doorway he stopped and wrung her hand and said that not on any of his trips had he met a lady as nice as her and he asked if he could come again. She had said she would always be happy to see him. Joy had been standing in the road, apparently looking at something in the distance, when he came down the steps toward her, bent to the side with his heavy valise. He stopped where she was standing and confronted her directly. Mrs. Hopewell could not hear what he said but she trembled to think what Joy would say to him. She could see that after a minute Joy said something and that then the boy began to speak again, making an excited gesture with his free hand. After a minute Joy said something else at which the boy began to speak once more. Then to her amazement, Mrs. Hopewell saw the two of them walk off together, toward the gate. Joy had walked all the way to the gate with him and Mrs. Hopewell could not imagine what they had said to each other, and she had not yet dared to ask. Mrs. Freeman was insisting upon her attention. She had moved from the refrigerator to the heater so that Mrs. Hopewell had to turn and face her in order to seem to be listening. “Glynese gone out with Harvey Hill again last night,” she said. “She had this sty.” “Hill,” Mrs. Hopewell said absently, “is that the one who works in the garage?” “Nome, he’s the one that goes to chiropracter school,” Mrs. Freeman said. “She had this sty. Been had it two days. So she says when he brought her in the other night he says, ‘Lemme get rid of that sty for you,’and she says, ‘How?’and he says, ‘You just lay yourself down acrost the seat of that car and I’ll show you.’ So she done it and he popped her neck. Kept on a-popping it several times until she made him quit. This morning,” Mrs. Freeman said, “she ain’t got no sty. She ain’t got no traces of a sty.” “I never heard of that before,” Mrs. Hopewell said. “He ast her to marry him before the Ordinary,” Mrs. Freeman went on, “and she told himshe wasn’t going to be married in no of ice.” “Well, Glynese is a fine girl,” Mrs. Hopewell said. “Glynese and Carramae are both fine girls.” “Carramae said when her and Lyman was married Lyman said it sure felt sacred to him. She said he said he wouldn’t take five hundred dollars for being married by a preacher.” “How much would he take?” the girl asked fromthe stove. “He said he wouldn’t take five hundred dollars,” Mrs. Freeman repeated. “Well we all have work to do,” Mrs. Hopewell said. “Lyman said it just felt more sacred to him,” Mrs. Freeman said. “The doctor wants Carramae to eat prunes. Says instead of medicine. Says them cramps is coming frompressure. You know where I think it is?” “She’ll be better in a few weeks,” Mrs. Hopewell said. “In the tube,” Mrs. Freeman said. “Else she wouldn’t be as sick as she is.” Hulga had cracked her two eggs into a saucer and was bringing them to the table along with a cup of coffee that she had filled too full. She sat down carefully and began to eat, meaning to keep Mrs. Freeman there by questions if for any reason she showed an inclination to leave. She could perceive her mother’s eye on her. The first round-about question would be about the Bible salesman and she did not wish to bring it on. “How did he pop her neck?” she asked. Mrs. Freeman went into a description of how he had popped her neck. She said he owned a ’55 Mercury but that Glynese said she would rather marry a man with only a ’36 Plymouth who would be married by a preacher. The girl asked what if he had a ’32 Plymouth and Mrs. Freeman said what Glynese had said was a ’36 Plymouth. Mrs. Hopewell said there were not many girls with Glynese’s common sense. She said what she admired in those girls was their common sense. She said that reminded her that they had had a nice visitor yesterday, a young man selling Bibles. “Lord,” she said, “he bored me to death but he was so sincere and genuine I couldn’t be rude to him. He was just good country people, you know,” she said, “—just the salt of the earth.” “I seen him walk up,” Mrs. Freeman said, “and then later—I seen him walk off,” and Hulga could feel the slight shift in her voice, the slight insinuation, that he had not walked off alone, had he? Her face remained expressionless but the color rose into her neck and she seemed to swallow it down with the next spoonful of egg. Mrs. Freeman was looking at her as if they had a secret together. “Well, it takes all kinds of people to make the world go ’round,” Mrs. Hopewell said. “It’s very good we aren’t all alike.” “Some people are more alike than others,” Mrs. Freeman said. Hulga got up and stumped, with about twice the noise that was necessary, into her room and locked the door. She was to meet the Bible salesman at ten o’clock at the gate. She had thought about it half the night. She had started thinking of it as a great joke and then she had begun to see profound implications in it. She had lain in bed imagining dialogues for them that were insane on the surface but that reached below to depths that no Bible salesman would be aware of. Their conversation yesterday had been of this kind. He had stopped in front of her and had simply stood there. His face was bony and sweaty and bright, with a little pointed nose in the center of it, and his look was different from what it had been at the dinner table. He was gazing at her with open curiosity, with fascination, like a child watching a new fantastic animal at the zoo, and he was breathing as if he had run a great distance to reach her. His gaze seemed somehow familiar but she could not think where she had been regarded with it before. For almost a minute he didn’t say anything. Then on what seemed an insuck of breath, he whispered, “You ever ate a chicken that was two days old?” The girl looked at him stonily. He might have just put this question up for consideration at the meeting of a philosophical association. “Yes,” she presently replied as if she had considered it fromall angles. “It must have been mighty small!” he said triumphantly and shook all over with little nervous giggles, getting very red in the face, and subsiding finally into his gaze of complete admiration, while the girl’s expression remained exactly the same. “How old are you?” he asked softly. She waited some time before she answered. Then in a flat voice she said, “Seventeen.” His smiles came in succession like waves breaking on the surface of a little lake. “I see you got a wooden leg,” he said. “I think you’re brave. I think you’re real sweet.” The girl stood blank and solid and silent. “Walk to the gate with me,” he said. “You’re a brave sweet little thing and I liked you the minute I seen you walk in the door.” Hulga began to move forward. “What’s your name?” he asked, smiling down on the top of her head. “Hulga,” she said. “Hulga,” he murmured, “Hulga. Hulga. I never heard of anybody name Hulga before. You’re shy, aren’t you, Hulga?” he asked. She nodded, watching his large red hand on the handle of the giant valise. “I like girls that wear glasses,” he said. “I think a lot. I’mnot like these people that a serious thought don’t ever enter their heads. It’s because I may die.” “I may die too,” she said suddenly and looked up at him. His eyes were very small and brown, glittering feverishly. “Listen,” he said, “don’t you think some people was meant to meet on account of what all they got in common and all? Like they both think serious thoughts and all?” He shifted the valise to his other hand so that the hand nearest her was free. He caught hold of her elbow and shook it a little. “I don’t work on Saturday,” he said. “I like to walk in the woods and see what Mother Nature is wearing. O’er the hills and far away. Pic-nics and things. Couldn’t we go on a pic-nic tomorrow? Say yes, Hulga,” he said and gave her a dying look as if he felt his insides about to drop out of him. He had even seemed to sway slightly toward her. During the night she had imagined that she seduced him. She imagined that the two of them walked on the place until they came to the storage barn beyond the two back fields and there, she imagined, that things came to such a pass that she very easily seduced him and that then, of course, she had to reckon with his remorse. True genius can get an idea across even to an inferior mind. She imagined that she took his remorse in hand and changed it into a deeper understanding of life. She took all his shame away and turned it into something useful. She set off for the gate at exactly ten o’clock, escaping without drawing Mrs. Hopewell’s attention. She didn’t take anything to eat, forgetting that food is usually taken on a picnic. She wore a pair of slacks and a dirty white shirt, and as an afterthought, she had put some Vapex on the collar of it since she did not own any perfume. When she reached the gate no one was there. She looked up and down the empty highway and had the furious feeling that she had been tricked, that he had only meant to make her walk to the gate after the idea of him. Then suddenly he stood up, very tall, from behind a bush on the opposite embankment. Smiling, he lifted his hat which was new and widebrimmed. He had not worn it yesterday and she wondered if he had bought it for the occasion. It was toast-colored with a red and white band around it and was slightly too large for him. He stepped from behind the bush still carrying the black valise. He had on the same suit and the same yellow socks sucked down in his shoes fromwalking. He crossed the highway and said, “I knew you’d come!” The girl wondered acidly how he had known this. She pointed to the valise and asked, “Why did you bring your Bibles?” He took her elbow, smiling down on her as if he could not stop. “You can never tell when you’ll need the word of God, Hulga,” he said. She had a moment in which she doubted that this was actually happening and then they began to climb the embankment. They went down into the pasture toward the woods. The boy walked lightly by her side, bouncing on his toes. The valise did not seem to be heavy today; he even swung it. They crossed half the pasture without saying anything and then, putting his hand easily on the small of her back, he asked softly, “Where does your wooden leg join on?” She turned an ugly red and glared at him and for an instant the boy looked abashed. “I didn’t mean you no harm,” he said. “I only meant you’re so brave and all. I guess God takes care of you.” “No,” she said, looking forward and walking fast, “I don’t even believe in God.” At this he stopped and whistled. “No!” he exclaimed as if he were too astonished to say anything else. She walked on and in a second he was bouncing at her side, fanning with his hat. “That’s very unusual for a girl,” he remarked, watching her out of the corner of his eye. When they reached the edge of the wood, he put his hand on her back again and drew her against himwithout a word and kissed her heavily. The kiss, which had more pressure than feeling behind it, produced that extra surge of adrenalin in the girl that enables one to carry a packed trunk out of a burning house, but in her, the power went at once to the brain. Even before he released her, her mind, clear and detached and ironic anyway, was regarding him from a great distance, with amusement but with pity. She had never been kissed before and she was pleased to discover that it was an unexceptional experience and all a matter of the mind’s control. Some people might enjoy drain water if they were told it was vodka. When the boy, looking expectant but uncertain, pushed her gently away, she turned and walked on, saying nothing as if such business, for her, were common enough. He came along panting at her side, trying to help her when he saw a root that she might trip over. He caught and held back the long swaying blades of thorn vine until she had passed beyond them. She led the way and he came breathing heavily behind her. Then they came out on a sunlit hillside, sloping softly into another one a little smaller. Beyond, they could see the rusted top of the old barn where the extra hay was stored. The hill was sprinkled with small pink weeds. “Then you ain’t saved?” he asked suddenly, stopping. The girl smiled. It was the first time she had smiled at him at all. “In my economy,” she said, “I’msaved and you are damned but I told you I didn’t believe in God.” Nothing seemed to destroy the boy’s look of admiration. He gazed at her now as if the fantastic animal at the zoo had put its paw through the bars and given him a loving poke. She thought he looked as if he wanted to kiss her again and she walked on before he had the chance. “Ain’t there somewheres we can sit down sometime?” he murmured, his voice softening toward the end of the sentence. “In that barn,” she said. They made for it rapidly as if it might slide away like a train. It was a large two-story barn, cool and dark inside. The boy pointed up the ladder that led into the loft and said, “It’s too bad we can’t go up there.” “Why can’t we?” she asked. “Yer leg,” he said reverently. The girl gave him a contemptuous look and putting both hands on the ladder, she climbed it while he stood below, apparently awestruck. She pulled herself expertly through the opening and then looked down at him and said, “Well, come on if you’re coming,” and he began to climb the ladder, awkwardly bringing the suitcase with him. “We won’t need the Bible,” she observed. “You never can tell,” he said, panting. After he had got into the loft, he was a few seconds catching his breath. She had sat down in a pile of straw. A wide sheath of sunlight, filled with dust particles, slanted over her. She lay back against a bale, her face turned away, looking out the front opening of the barn where hay was thrown from a wagon into the loft. The two pink-speckled hillsides lay back against a dark ridge of woods. The sky was cloudless and cold blue. The boy dropped down by her side and put one arm under her and the other over her and began methodically kissing her face, making little noises like a fish. He did not remove his hat but it was pushed far enough back not to interfere. When her glasses got in his way, he took themoff of her and slipped theminto his pocket. The girl at first did not return any of the kisses but presently she began to and after she had put several on his cheek, she reached his lips and remained there, kissing him again and again as if she were trying to draw all the breath out of him. His breath was clear and sweet like a child’s and the kisses were sticky like a child’s. He mumbled about loving her and about knowing when he first seen her that he loved her, but the mumbling was like the sleepy fretting of a child being put to sleep by his mother. Her mind, throughout this, never stopped or lost itself for a second to her feelings. “You ain’t said you loved me none,” he whispered finally, pulling back fromher. “You got to say that.” She looked away from him off into the hollow sky and men down at a black ridge and then down farmer into what appeared to be two green swelling lakes. She didn’t realize he had taken her glasses but this landscape could not seem exceptional to her for she seldompaid any close attention to her surroundings. “You got to say it,” he repeated. “You got to say you love me.” She was always careful how she committed herself. “In a sense,” she began, “if you use the word loosely, you might say that. But it’s not a word I use. I don’t have illusions. I’mone of those people who see through to nothing.” The boy was frowning. “You got to say it. I said it and you got to say it,” he said. The girl looked at him almost tenderly. “You poor baby,” she murmured. “It’s just as well you don’t understand,” and she pulled him by the neck, face-down, against her. “We are all damned,” she said, “but some of us have taken off our blindfolds and see that there’s nothing to see. It’s a kind of salvation.” The boy’s astonished eyes looked blankly through the ends of her hair. “Okay,” he almost whined, “but do you love me or don’tcher?” “Yes,” she said and added, “in a sense. But I must tell you something. There mustn’t be anything dishonest between us.” She lifted his head and looked him in the eye. “I amthirty years old,” she said. “I have a number of degrees.” The boy’s look was irritated but dogged. “I don’t care,” he said. “I don’t care a thing about what all you done. I just want to know if you love me or don’tcher?” and he caught her to him and wildly planted her face with kisses until she said, “Yes, yes.” “Okay then,” he said, letting her go. “Prove it.” She smiled, looking dreamily out on the shifty landscape. She had seduced him without even making up her mind to try. “How?” she asked, feeling that he should be delayed a little. He leaned over and put his lips to her ear. “Show me where your wooden leg joins on,” he whispered. The girl uttered a sharp little cry and her face instantly drained of color. The obscenity of the suggestion was not what shocked her. As a child she had sometimes been subject to feelings of shame but education had removed the last traces of that as a good surgeon scrapes for cancer; she would no more have felt it over what he was asking than she would have believed in his Bible. But she was as sensitive about the artificial leg as a peacock about his tail. No one ever touched it but her. She took care of it as someone else would his soul, in private and almost with her own eyes turned away. “No,” she said. “I known it,” he muttered, sitting up. “You’re just playing me for a sucker.” “Oh no no!” she cried. “It joins on at the knee. Only at the knee. Why do you want to see it?” The boy gave her a long penetrating look. “Because,” he said, “it’s what makes you different. You ain’t like anybody else.” She sat staring at him. There was nothing about her face or her round freezingblue eyes to indicate that this had moved her; but she felt as if her heart had stopped and left her mind to pump her blood. She decided that for the first time in her life she was face to face with real innocence. This boy, with an instinct that came from beyond wisdom, had touched the truth about her. When after a minute, she said in a hoarse high voice, “All right,” it was like surrendering to him completely. It was like losing her own life and finding it again, miraculously, in his. Very gently he began to roll the slack leg up. The artificial limb, in a white sock and brown flat shoe, was bound in a heavy material like canvas and ended in an ugly jointure where it was attached to the stump. The boy’s face and his voice were entirely reverent as he uncovered it and said, “Now show me how to take it off and on.” She took it off for him and put it back on again and then he took it off himself, handling it as tenderly as if it were a real one. “See!” he said with a delighted child’s face. “Now I can do it myself!” “Put it back on,” she said. She was thinking that she would run away with him and that every night he would take the leg off and every morning put it back on again. “Put it back on,” she said. “Not yet,” he murmured, setting it on its foot out of her reach. “Leave it off for a while. You got me instead.” She gave a little cry of alarm but he pushed her down and began to kiss her again. Without the leg she felt entirely dependent on him. Her brain seemed to have stopped thinking altogether and to be about some other function that it was not very good at. Different expressions raced back and forth over her face. Every now and then the boy, his eyes like two steel spikes, would glance behind him where the leg stood. Finally she pushed himoff and said, “Put it back on me now.” “Wait,” he said. He leaned the other way and pulled the valise toward himand opened it. It had a pale blue spotted lining and there were only two Bibles in it. He took one of these out and opened the cover of it. It was hollow and contained a pocket flask of whiskey, a pack of cards, and a small blue box with printing on it. He laid these out in front of her one at a time in an evenly-spaced row, like one presenting offerings at the shrine of a goddess. He put the blue box in her hand. THIS PRODUCT TO BE USED ONLY FOR THE PREVENTION OF DISEASE, she read, and dropped it. The boy was unscrewing the top of the flask. He stopped and pointed, with a smile, to the deck of cards. It was not an ordinary deck but one with an obscene picture on the back of each card. “Take a swig,” he said, offering her the bottle first. He held it in front of her, but like one mesmerized, she did not move. Her voice when she spoke had an almost pleading sound. “Aren’t you,” she murmured, “aren’t you just good country people?” The boy cocked his head. He looked as if he were just beginning to understand that she might be trying to insult him. “Yeah,” he said, curling his lip slightly, “but it ain’t held me back none. I’mas good as you any day in the week.” “Give me my leg,” she said. He pushed it farther away with his foot. “Come on now, let’s begin to have us a good time,” he said coaxingly. “We ain’t got to know one another good yet.” “Give me my leg!” she screamed and tried to lunge for it but he pushed her down easily. “What’s the matter with you all of a sudden?” he asked, frowning as he screwed the top on the flask and put it quickly back inside the Bible. “You just a while ago said you didn’t believe in nothing. I thought you was some girl!” Her face was almost purple. “You’re a Christian!” she hissed. “You’re a fine Christian! You’re just like them all—say one thing and do another. You’re a perfect Christian, you’re…” The boy’s mouth was set angrily. “I hope you don’t think,” he said in a lofty indignant tone, “that I believe in that crap! I may sell Bibles but I know which end is up and I wasn’t born yesterday and I know where I’mgoing!” “Give me my leg!” she screeched. He jumped up so quickly that she barely saw him sweep the cards and the blue box into the Bible and throw the Bible into the valise. She saw him grab the leg and then she saw it for an instant slanted forlornly across the inside of the suitcase with a Bible at either side of its opposite ends. He slammed the lid shut and snatched up the valise and swung it down the hole and then stepped through himself. When all of him had passed but his head, he turned and regarded her with a look that no longer had any admiration in it. “I’ve gotten a lot of interesting things,” he said. “One time I got a woman’s glass eye this way. And you needn’t to think you’ll catch me because Pointer ain’t really my name. I use a different name at every house I call at and don’t stay nowhere long. And I’ll tell you another thing, Hulga,” he said, using the name as if he didn’t think much of it, “you ain’t so smart. I been believing in nothing ever since I was born!” and then the toastcolored hat disappeared down the hole and the girl was left, sitting on the straw in the dusty sunlight. When she turned her churning face toward the opening, she saw his blue figure struggling successfully over the green speckled lake. Mrs. Hopewell and Mrs. Freeman, who were in the back pasture, digging up onions, saw him emerge a little later from the woods and head across the meadow toward the highway. “Why, that looks like that nice dull young man that tried to sell me a Bible yesterday,” Mrs. Hopewell said, squinting. “He must have been selling themto the Negroes back in there. He was so simple,” he said, “but I guess the world would be better off if we were all that simple.” Mrs. Freeman’s gaze drove forward and just touched him before he disappeared under the hill. Then she returned her attention to the evil-smelling onion shoot she was lifting fromthe ground. “Some can’t be that simple,” she said. “I know I never could.”
THE PEACOCK was following Mrs. Shortley up the road to the hill where she meant to stand. Moving one behind the other, they looked like a complete procession. Her arms were folded and as she mounted the prominence, she might have been the giant wife of the countryside, come out at some sign of danger to see what the trouble was. She stood on two tremendous legs, with the grand self-confidence of a mountain, and rose, up narrowing bulges of granite, to two icy blue points of light that pierced forward, surveying everything. She ignored the white afternoon sun which was creeping behind a ragged wall of cloud as if it pretended to be an intruder and cast her gaze down the red clay road that turned off from the highway.  The peacock stopped just behind her, his tail -- glittering green-gold and blue in the sunlight -- lifted just enough so that it would not touch the ground. It flowed out on either side like a floating train and his head on the long blue reed-like neck was drawn back as if his attention were fixed in the distance on something no one else could see.   Mrs. Shortley was watching a black car turn through the gate from the highway. Over by the toolshed, about fifteen feet away, the two Negroes, Astor and Sulk, had stopped work to watch. They were hidden by a mulberry tree but Mrs. Shortley knew they were there.  Mrs. McIntyre was coming down the steps of her house to meet the car. She had on her largest smile but Mrs. Shortley, even from her distance, could detect a nervous slide in it. These people who were coming were only hired help, like the Shortleys themselves or the Negroes. Yet here was the owner of the place out to welcome them. Here she was, wearing her best clothes and a string of beads, and now bounding forward with her mouth stretched.  The car stopped at the walk just as she did and the priest was the first to get out. He was a long-legged black-suited old man with a white hat on and a collar that he wore backwards, which, Mrs. Shortley knew, was what priests did who wanted to be known as priests. It was this priest who had arranged for these people to come here. He opened the back door of the car and out jumped two children, a boy and a girl, and then, stepping more slowly, a woman in brown, shaped like a peanut. Then the front door opened and out stepped the man, the Displaced Person. He was short and a little sway-backed and wore gold-rimmed spectacles.   Mrs. Shortley's vision narrowed on him and then widened to include the woman and the two children in a group picture. The first thing that struck her as very peculiar was that they looked like other people. Every time she had seen them in her imagination, the image she had got was of the three bears, walking single file, with wooden shoes on like Dutchmen and sailor hats and bright coats with a lot of buttons. But the woman had on a dress she might have worn herself and the children were dressed like anybody from around. The man had on khaki pants and a blue shirt. Suddenly, as Mrs. McIntyre held out her hand to him, he bobbed down from the waist and kissed it.  Mrs. Shortley jerked her own hand up toward her mouth and then after a second brought it down and rubbed it vigorously on her seat. If Mr. Shortley had tried to kiss her hand, Mrs. McIntyre would have knocked him into the middle of next week, but then Mr. Shortley wouldn't have kissed her hand anyway. He didn't have time to mess around.  She looked closer, squinting. The boy was in the center of the group, talking. He was supposed to speak the most English because he had learned some in Poland and so he was to listen to his father's Polish and say it in English and then listen to Mrs. McIntyre's English and say that in Polish. The priest had told Mrs. McIntyre his name was Rudolph and he  was twelve and the girl's name was Sledgewig and she was nine. Sledgewig sounded to Mrs. Shortley like something you would name a bug, or vice versa, as if you named a boy Bollweevil. All of them's last name was something that only they themselves and the priest could pronounce. All she could make out of it was Gobblehook. She and Mrs. McIntyre had been calling them the Gobblehooks all week while they got ready for them.  There had been a great deal to do to get ready for them because they didn't have anything of their own, not a stick of furniture or a sheet or a dish, and everything had had to be scraped together out of things that Mrs. McIntyre couldn't use any more herself. They had collected a piece of odd furniture here and a piece there and they had taken some flowered chicken feed sacks and made curtains for the windows, two red and one green, because they had not had enough of the red sacks to go around. Mrs. McIntyre said she was not made of money and she could not afford to buy curtains. "They can't talk," Mrs. Shortley said. "You reckon they'll know what colors even is?" and Mrs. McIntyre had said that after what those people had been through, they should be grateful for anything they could get. She said to think how lucky they were to escape from over there and come to a place like this.   Mrs. Shortley recalled a newsreel she had seen once of a small room piled high with bodies of dead naked people all in a heap, their arms and legs tangled together, a head thrust in here, a head there, a foot, a knee, a part that should have been covered up sticking out, a hand raised clutching nothing. Before you could realize that it was real and take it into your head, the picture changed and a hollow-sounding voice was saying, "Time marches on!" This was the kind of thing that was happening every day in Europe where they had not advanced as in this country, and watching from her vantage point, Mrs. Shortley had the sudden intuition that the Gobblehooks, like rats with typhoid fleas, could have carried all those murderous ways over the water with them directly to this place. If they had come from where that kind of thing was done to them, who was to say they were not the kind that would also do it to others? The width and breadth of this question nearly shook her. Her stomach trembled as if there had been a slight quake in the heart of the mountain and automatically she moved down from her elevation and went forward to be introduced to them, as if she meant to find out at once what they were capable of.  She approached, stomach foremost, head back, arms folded, boots flopping gently against her large legs. About fifteen feet from the  gesticulating group, she stopped and made her presence felt by training her gaze on the back of Mrs. McIntyre's neck. Mrs. McIntyre was a small woman of sixty with a round wrinkled face and red bangs that came almost down to two high orange-colored penciled eyebrows. She had a little doll's mouth and eyes that were a soft blue when she opened them wide but more like steel or granite when she narrowed them to inspect a milk can. She had buried one husband and divorced two and Mrs. Shortley respected her as a person nobody had put anything over on yet -- except, ha, ha, perhaps the Shortleys. She held out her arm in Mrs. Shortley's direction and said to the Rudolph boy, "And this is Mrs. Shortley. Mr. Shortley is my dairyman. Where's Mr. Shortley?" she asked as his wife began to approach again, her arms still folded. "I want him to meet the Guizacs."  Now it was Guizac. She wasn't calling them Gobblehook to their face. "Chancey's at the barn," Mrs. Shortley said. "He don't have time to rest himself in the bushes like them niggers over there."  Her look first grazed the tops of the displaced people's heads and then revolved downwards slowly, the way a buzzard glides and drops in the air until it alights on the carcass. She stood far enough away so that the man would not be able to kiss her hand. He looked directly at her with little  green eyes and gave her a broad grin that was toothless on one side. Mrs. Shortley, without smiling, turned her attention to the little girl who stood by the mother, swinging her shoulders from side to side. She had long braided hair in two looped pigtails and there was no denying she was a pretty child even if she did have a a bug's name. She was better looking than either Annie Maude or Sarah Mae, Mrs. Shortley's two girls going on fifteen and seventeen but Annie Maude had never got her growth and Sarah Mae had a cast in her eye. She compared the foreign boy to her son, H. C., and H. C. came out far ahead. H. C. was twenty years old with her build and eye-glasses. He was going to Bible school now and when he finished he was going to start him a church. He had a strong sweet voice for hymns and could sell anything. Mrs. Shortley looked at the priest and was reminded that these people did not have an advanced religion. There was no telling what all they believed since none of the foolishness had been reformed out of it. Again she saw the room piled high with bodies.  The priest spoke in a foreign way himself, English but as if he had a throatful of hay. He had a big nose and a bald rectangular face and head. While she was observing him, his large mouth dropped open and with a stare behind her, he said, "Arrrrrrr!" and pointed.  Mrs. Shortley spun around. The peacock was standing a few feet  behind her, with his head slightly cocked.  "What a beauti-ful birdrrrd!" the priest murmured.  "Another mouth to feed," Mrs. McIntyre said, glancing in the peafowl's direction.  "And when does he raise his splendid tail?" asked the priest.  "Just when it suits him," she said. "There used to be twenty or thirty of those things on the place but I've let them die off. I don't like to hear them scream in the middle of the night."  "So beauti-ful," the priest said. "A tail full of suns," and he crept forward on tiptoe and looked down on the bird's back where the polished gold and green design began. The peacock stood still as if he had just come down from some sun-drenched height to be a vision for them all. The priest's homely red face hung over him, glowing with pleasure.  Mrs. Shortley's mouth had drawn acidly to one side. "Nothing but a peachicken," she muttered.  Mrs. McIntyre raised her orange eyebrows and exchanged a look with her to indicate that the old man was in his second childhood. "Well, we must show the Guizacs their new home," she said impatiently and she herded them into the car again. The peacock stepped oft toward the mulberry tree where the two Negroes were hiding and the priest turned  his absorbed face away and got in the car and drove the displaced people down to the shack they were to occupy.  Mrs. Shortley waited until the car was out of sight and then she made her way circuitously to the mulberry tree and stood about ten feet behind the two Negroes, one an old man holding a bucket half full of calf feed and the other a yellowish boy with a short woodchuck-like head pushed into a rounded felt hat. "Well," she said slowly, "yawl have looked long enough. What you think about them?"  The old man, Astor, raised himself. "We been watching," he said as if this would be news to her. "Who they now?"  "They come from over the water," Mrs. Shortley said with a wave of her arm. "They're what is called Displaced Persons."  "Displaced Persons," he said. "Well now. I declare. What do that mean?"  "It means they ain't where they were born at and there's nowhere for them to go -- like if you was run out of here and wouldn't nobody have you."  "It seem like they here, though," the old man said in a reflective voice. "If they here, they somewhere."  "Sho is," the other agreed. "They here."   The illogic of Negro-thinking always irked Mrs. Shortley. "They ain't where they belong to be at," she said. "They belong to be back over yonder where everything is still like they been used to. Over here it's more advanced than where they come from. But yawl better look out now," she said and nodded her head. "There's about ten million billion more just like them and I know what Mrs. McIntyre said."  "Say what?" the young one asked.  "Places are not easy to get nowadays, for white or black, but I reckon I heard what she stated to me," she said in a sing-song voice.  "You liable to hear most anything," the old man remarked, leaning forward as if he were about to walk off but holding himself suspended.  "I heard her say, 'This is going to put the Fear of the Lord into those shiftless niggers!'" Mrs. Shortley said in a ringing voice.  The old man started off. "She say something like that every now and then," he said. "Ha. Ha. Yes indeed."  "You better get on in that barn and help Mr. Shortley," she said to the other one. "What you reckon she pays you for?"  "He the one sont me out," the Negro muttered. "He the one gimme something else to do."  "Well you better get to doing it then," she said and stood there until he  moved off. Then she stood a while longer, reflecting, her unseeing eyes directly in front of the peacock's tail. He had jumped into the tree and his tail hung in front of her, full of fierce planets with eyes that were each ringed in green and set against a sun that was gold in one second's light and salmon-colored in the next. She might have been looking at a map of the universe but she didn't notice it any more than she did the spots of sky that cracked the dull green of the tree. She was having an inner vision instead. She was seeing the ten million billion of them pushing their way into new places over here and herself, a giant angel with wings as wide as a house, telling the Negroes that they would have to find another place. She turned herself in the direction of the barn, musing on this, her expression lofty and satisfied.  She approached the barn from an oblique angle that allowed her a look in the door before she could be seen herself. Mr. Chancey Shortley was adjusting the last milking machine on a large black and white spotted cow near the entrance, squatting at her heels. There was about a half-inch of cigarette adhering to the center of his lower lip. Mrs. Shortley observed it minutely for half a second. "If she seen or heard of you smoking in this barn, she would blow a fuse," she said.  Mr. Shortley raised a sharply rutted face containing a washout under  each cheek and two long crevices eaten down both sides of his blistered mouth. "You gonter be the one to tell her?" he asked.  "She's got a nose of her own," Mrs. Shortley said.  Mr. Shortley, without appearing to give the feat any consideration, lifted the cigarette stub with the sharp end of his tongue, drew it into his mouth, closed his lips tightly, rose, stepped out, gave his wife a good round appreciative stare, and spit the smoldering butt into the grass.  "Aw Chancey," she said, "haw haw," and she dug a little hole for it with her toe and covered it up. This trick of Mr. Shortley's was actually his way of making love to her. When he had done his courting, he had not brought a guitar to strum or anything pretty for her to keep, but had sat on her porch steps, not saying a word, imitating a paralyzed man propped up to enjoy a cigarette. When the cigarette got the proper size, he would turn his eyes to her and open his mouth and draw in the butt and then sit there as if he had swallowed it, looking at her with the most loving look anybody could imagine. It nearly drove her wild and every time he did it, she wanted to pull his hat down over his eyes and hug him to death.  "Well," she said, going into the barn after him, "the Gobblehooks have come and she wants you to meet them, says, 'Where's Mr. Shortley?' and I says, 'He don't have time   "Tote up them weights," Mr. Shortley said, squatting to the cow again.  "You reckon he can drive a tractor when he don't know English?" she asked. "I don't think she's going to get her money's worth out of them. That boy can talk but he looks delicate. The one can work can't talk and the one can talk can't work. She ain't any better off than if she had more niggers."  "I rather have a nigger if it was me," Mr. Shortley said.  "She says it's ten million more like them, Displaced Persons, she says that there priest can get her all she wants."  "She better quit messin with that there priest," Mr. Shortley said.  "He don't look smart," Mrs. Shortley said, "kind of foolish."  "I ain't going to have the Pope of Rome tell me how to run no dairy," Mr. Shortley said.  "They ain't Eye-talians, they're Poles," she said. "From Poland where all them bodies were stacked up at. You remember all them bodies?"  "I give them three weeks here," Mr. Shortley said.  Three weeks later Mrs. McIntyre and Mrs. Shortley drove to the cane bottom to see Mr. Guizac start to operate the silage cutter, a new machine  that Mrs. McIntyre had just bought because she said, for the first time, she had somebody who could operate it. Mr. Guizac could drive a tractor, use the rotary hay-baler, the silage cutter, the combine, the letz mill, or any other machine she had on the place. He was an expert mechanic, a carpenter, and a mason. He was thrifty and energetic. Mrs. McIntyre said she figured he would save her twenty dollars a month on repair bills alone. She said getting him was the best day's work she had ever done in her life. He could work milking machines and he was scrupulously clean. He did not smoke.  She parked her car on the edge of the cane field and they got out. Sulk, the young Negro, was attaching the wagon to the cutter and Mr. Guizac was attaching the cutter to the tractor. He finished first and pushed the colored boy out of the way and attached the wagon to the cutter himself, gesticulating with a bright angry face when he wanted the hammer or the screwdriver. Nothing was done quick enough to suit him. The Negroes made him nervous.  The week before, he had come upon Sulk at the dinner hour, sneaking with a croker sack into the pen where the young turkeys were. He had watched him take a frying-size turkey from the lot and thrust it in the sack and put the sack under his coat. Then he had followed him around the  barn, jumped on him, dragged him to Mrs. McIntyre's back door and had acted out the entire scene for her, while the Negro muttered and grumbled and said God might strike him dead if he had been stealing any turkey, he had only been taking it to put some black shoe polish on its head because it had the sorehead. God might strike him dead if that was not the truth before Jesus. Mrs. McIntyre told him to go put the turkey back and then she was a long time explaining to the Pole that all Negroes would steal. She finally had to call Rudolph and tell him in English and have him tell his father in Polish, and Mr. Guizac had gone off with a startled disappointed face.  Mrs. Shortley stood by hoping there would be trouble with the silage machine but there was none. All of Mr. Guizac's motions were quick and accurate. He jumped on the tractor like a monkey and maneuvered the big orange cutter into the cane; in a second the silage was spurting in a green jet out of the pipe into the wagon. He went jolting down the row until he disappeared from sight and the noise became remote.  Mrs. McIntyre sighed with pleasure. "At last," she said, "I've got somebody I can depend on. For years I've been fooling with sorry people. Sorry people. Poor white trash and niggers," she muttered. "They've drained me dry. Before you all came I had Ringfields and Collins and  Jarrells and Perkins and Pinkins and Herrins and God knows what all else and not a one of them left without taking something off this place that didn't belong to them. Not a one!"  Mrs. Shortley could listen to this with composure because she knew that if Mrs. McIntyre had considered her trash, they couldn't have talked about trashy people together. Neither of them approved of trash. Mrs. McIntyre continued with the monologue that Mrs. Shortley had heard oftentimes before. "I've been running this place for thirty years," she said, looking with a deep frown out over the field, "and always just barely making it. People think you're made of money. I have the taxes to pay. I have the insurance to keep up. I have the repair bills. I have the feed bills." It all gathered up and she stood with her chest lifted and her small hands gripped around her elbows. "Ever since the Judge died," she said, "I've barely been making ends meet and they all take something when they leave. The niggers don't leave -- they stay and steal. A nigger thinks anybody is rich he can steal from and that white trash thinks anybody is rich who can afford to hire people as sorry as they are. And all I've got is the dirt under my feet!"  You hire and fire, Mrs. Shortley thought, but she didn't always say what she thought. She stood by and let Mrs. McIntyre say it all out to the  end but this time it didn't end as usual. "But at last I'm saved!" Mrs. McIntyre said. "One fellow's misery is the other fellow's gain. That man there," and she pointed where the Displaced Person had disappeared, "-- he has to work! He wants to work!" She turned to Mrs. Shortley with her bright wrinkled face. "That man is my salvation!" she said.  Mrs. Shortley looked straight ahead as if her vision penetrated the cane and the hill and pierced through to the other side. "I would suspicion salvation got from the devil," she said in a slow detached way.  "Now what do you mean by that?" Mrs. McIntyre asked, looking at her sharply.  Mrs. Shortley wagged her head but would not say anything else. The fact was she had nothing else to say for this intuition had only at that instant come to her. She had never given much thought to the devil for she felt that religion was essentially for those people who didn't have the brains to avoid evil without it. For people like herself, for people of gumption, it was a social occasion providing the opportunity to sing; but if she had ever given it much thought, she would have considered the devil the head of it and God the hanger-on. With the coming of these displaced people, she was obliged to give new thought to a good many things.   "I know what Sledgewig told Annie Maude," she said, and when Mrs. McIntyre carefully did not ask her what but reached down and broke off a sprig of sassafras to chew, she continued in a way to indicate she was not telling all, "that they wouldn't be able to live long, the four of them, on seventy dollars a month."  "He's worth raising," Mrs. McIntyre said. "He saves me money."  This was as much as to say that Chancey had never saved her money. Chancey got up at four in the morning to milk her cows, in winter wind and summer heat, and he had been doing it for the last two years. They had been with her the longest she had ever had anybody. The gratitude they got was these hints that she hadn't been saved any money.  "Is Mr. Shortley feeling better today?" Mrs. McIntyre asked.  Mrs. Shortley thought it was about time she was asking that question. Mr. Shortley had been in bed two days with an attack. Mr. Guizac had taken his place in the dairy in addition to doing his own work, "No he ain't," she said. "That doctor said he was suffering from over-exhaustion."  "If Mr. Shortley is over-exhausted," Mrs. McIntyre said, "then he must have a second job on the side," and she looked at Mrs. Shortley with almost closed eyes as if she were examining the bottom of a milk can.  Mrs. Shortley did not say a word but her dark suspicion grew like a  black thunder cloud. The fact was that Mr. Shortley did have a second job on the side and that, in a free country, this was none of Mrs. McIntyre's business. Mr. Shortley made whisky. He had a small still back in the farthest reaches of the place, on Mrs. McIntyre's land to be sure, but on land that she only owned and did not cultivate, on idle land that was not doing anybody any good. Mr. Shortley was not afraid of work. He got up at four in the morning and milked her cows and in the middle of the day when he was supposed to be resting, he was off attending to his still. Not every man would work like that. The Negroes knew about his still but he knew about theirs so there had never been any disagreeableness between them. But with foreigners on the place, with people who were all eyes and no understanding, who had come from a place continually fighting, where the religion had not been reformed -- with this kind of people, you had to be on the lookout every minute. She thought there ought to be a law against them. There was no reason they couldn't stay over there and take the places of some of the people who had been killed in their wars and butcherings.  "What's furthermore," she said suddenly, "Sledgewig said as soon as her papa saved the money, he was going to buy him a used car. Once they get them a used car, they'll leave you."   "I can't pay him enough for him to save money," Mrs. McIntyre said. "I'm not worrying about that. Of course," she said then, "if Mr. Shortley got incapacitated, I would have to use Mr. Guizac in the dairy all the time and I would have to pay him more. He doesn't smoke," she said, and it was the fifth time within the week that she had pointed this out.  "It is no man," Mrs. Shortley said emphatically, "that works as hard as Chancey, or is as easy with a cow, or is more of a Christian," and she folded her arms and her gaze pierced the distance. The noise of the tractor and cutter increased and Mr. Guizac appeared coming around the other side of the cane row. "Which can not be said about everybody," she muttered. She wondered whether, if the Pole found Chancey's still, he would know what it was. The trouble with these people was, you couldn't tell what they knew. Every time Mr. Guizac smiled, Europe stretched out in Mrs. Shortley's imagination, mysterious and evil, the devil's experiment station.  The tractor, the cutter, the wagon passed, rattling and rumbling and grinding before them. "Think how long that would have taken with men and mules to do it," Mrs. McIntyre shouted. "We'll get this whole bottom cut within two days at this rate."  "Maybe," Mrs. Shortley muttered, "if don't no terrible accident  occur." She thought how the tractor had made mules worthless. Nowadays you couldn't give away a mule. The next thing to go, she reminded herself, will be niggers.  In the afternoon she explained what was going to happen to them to Astor and Sulk who were in the cow lot, filling the manure spreader. She sat down next to the block of salt under a small shed, her stomach in her lap, her arms on top of it. "All you colored people better look out," she said. "You know how much you can get for a mule."  "Nothing, no indeed," the old man said, "not one thing."  "Before it was a tractor," she said, "it could be a mule. And before it was a Displaced Person, it could be a nigger. The time is going to come," she prophesied, "when it won't be no more occasion to speak of a nigger."  The old man laughed politely. "Yes indeed," he said. "Ha ha."  The young one didn't say anything. He only looked sullen but when she had gone in the house, he said, "Big Belly act like she know everything."  "Never mind," the old man said, "your place too low for anybody to dispute with you for it."  She didn't tell her fears about the still to Mr. Shortley until he was back on the job in the dairy. Then one night after they were in bed, she  said, "That man prowls."  Mr. Shortley folded his hands on his bony chest and pretended he was a corpse.  "Prowls," she continued and gave him a sharp kick in the side with her knee. "Who's to say what they know and don't know? Who's to say if he found it he wouldn't go right to her and tell? How you know they don't make liquor in Europe? They drive tractors. They got them all kinds of machinery. Answer me."  "Don't worry me now," Mr. Shortley said. "I'm a dead man."  "It's them little eyes of his that's foreign," she muttered. "And that way he's got of shrugging." She drew her shoulders up and shrugged several times. "Howcome he's got anything to shrug about?" she asked.  "If everybody was as dead as I am, nobody would have no trouble," Mr. Shortley said.  "That priest," she muttered and was silent for a minute. Then she said, "In Europe they probably got some different way to make liquor but I reckon they know all the ways. They're full of crooked ways. They never have advanced or reformed. They got the same religion as a thousand years ago. It could only be the devil responsible for that. Always fighting amongst each other. Disputing. And then get us into it. Ain't they got us  into it twict already and we ain't got no more sense than to go over there and settle it for them and then they come on back over here and snoop around and find your still and go straight to her. And liable to kiss her hand any minute. Do you hear me?"  "No," Mr. Shortley said.  "And I'll tell you another thing," she said. "I wouldn't be a tall surprised if he don't know everything you say, whether it be in English or not."  "I don't speak no other language," Mr. Shortley murmured.  "I suspect," she said, "that before long there won't be no more niggers on this place. And I tell you what. I'd rather have niggers than them Poles. And what's furthermore, I aim to take up for the niggers when the time comes. When Gobblehook first come here, you recollect how he shook their hands, like he didn't know the difference, like he might have been as black as them, but when it come to finding out Sulk was taking turkeys, he gone on and told her. I known he was taking turkeys. I could have told her myself."  Mr. Shortley was breathing softly as if he were asleep.  "A nigger don't know when he has a friend," she said. "And I'll tell you another thing. I get a heap out of Sledgewig. Sledgewig said that in  Poland they lived in a brick house and one night a man come and told them to get out of it before daylight. Do you believe they ever lived in a brick house?  "Airs," she said. "That's just airs. A wooden house is good enough for me. Chancey," she said, "turn thisaway. I hate to see niggers mistreated and run out. I have a heap of pity for niggers and poor folks. Ain't I always had?" she asked. "I say ain't I always been a friend to niggers and poor folks?  "When the time comes," she said, "I'll stand up for the niggers and that's that. I ain't going to see that priest drive out all the niggers."  Mrs. McIntyre bought a new drag harrow and a tractor with a power lift because she said, for the first time, she had someone who could handle machinery. She and Mrs. Shortley had driven to the back field to inspect what he had harrowed the day before. "That's been done beautifully!" Mrs. McIntyre said, looking out over the red undulating ground.  Mrs. McIntyre had changed since the Displaced Person had been working for her and Mrs. Shortley had observed the change very closely:  she had begun to act like somebody who was getting rich secretly and she didn't confide in Mrs. Shortley the way she used to. Mrs. Shortley suspected that the priest was at the bottom of the change. They were very slick. First he would get her into his Church and then he would get his hand in her pocketbook. Well, Mrs. Shortley thought, the more fool she! Mrs. Shortley had a secret herself. She knew something the Displaced Person was doing that would floor Mrs. McIntyre. "I still say he ain't going to work forever for seventy dollars a month," she murmured. She intended to keep her secret to herself and Mr. Shortley.  "Well," Mrs. McIntyre said, "I may have to get rid of some of this other help so I can pay him more."  Mrs. Shortley nodded to indicate she had known this for some time. "I'm not saying those niggers ain't had it coming," she said. "But they do the best they know how. You can always tell a nigger what to do and stand by until he does it."  "That's what the Judge said," Mrs. McIntyre said and looked at her with approval. The Judge was her first husband, the one who had left her the place. Mrs. Shortley had heard that she had married him when she was thirty and he was seventy-five, thinking she would be rich as soon as he died, but the old man was a scoundrel and when his estate was settled,  they found he didn't have a nickel. All he left her were the fifty acres and the house. But she always spoke of him in a reverent way and quoted his sayings, such as, "One fellow's misery is the other fellow's gain," and "The devil you know is better than the devil you don't."  "However," Mrs. Shortley remarked, "the devil you know is better than the devil you don't," and she had to turn away so that Mrs. McIntyre would not see her smile. She had found out what the Displaced Person was up to through the old man, Astor, and she had not told anybody but Mr. Shortley. Mr. Shortley had risen straight up in bed like Lazarus from the tomb.  "Shut your mouth!" he had said.  "Yes," she had said.  "Naw!" Mr. Shortley had said.  "Yes," she had said.  Mr. Shortley had fallen back flat.  "The Pole don't know any better," Mrs. Shortley had said. "I reckon that priest is putting him up to it is all. I blame the priest."  The priest came frequently to see the Guizacs and he would always stop in and visit Mrs. McIntyre too and they would walk around the place and she would point out her improvements and listen to his rattling talk. It  suddenly came to Mrs. Shortley that he was trying to persuade her to bring another Polish family onto the place. With two of them here, there would be almost nothing spoken but Polish! The Negroes would be gone and there would be the two families against Mr. Shortley and herself! She began to imagine a war of words, to see the Polish words and the English words coming at each other, stalking forward, not sentences, just words, gabble gabble gabble, flung out high and shrill and stalking forward and then grappling with each other. She saw the Polish words, dirty and all-knowing and unreformed, flinging mud on the clean English words until everything was equally dirty. She saw them all piled up in a room, all the dead dirty words, theirs and hers too, piled up like the naked bodies in the newsreel. God save me! she cried silently, from the stinking power of Satan I And she started from that day to read her Bible with a new attention. She poured over the Apocalypse and began to quote from the Prophets and before long she had come to a deeper understanding of her existence. She saw plainly that the meaning of the world was a mystery that had been planned and she was not surprised to suspect that she had a special part in the plan because she was strong. She saw that the Lord God Almighty had created the strong people to do what had to be done and she felt that she would be ready when she was called. Right  now she felt that her business was to watch the priest.  His visits irked her more and more. On the last one, he went about picking up feathers off the ground. He found two peacock feathers and four or five turkey feathers and an old brown hen feather and took them off with him like a bouquet. This foolish-acting did not deceive Mrs. Shortley any. Here he was: leading foreigners over in hoards to places that were not theirs, to cause disputes, to uproot niggers, to plant the Whore of Babylon in the midst of the righteousl Whenever he came on the place, she hid herself behind something and watched until he left.  It was on a Sunday afternoon that she had her vision. She had gone to drive in the cows for Mr. Shortley who had a pain in his knee and she was walking slowly through the pasture, her arms folded, her eyes on the distant low-lying clouds that looked like rows and rows of white fish washed up on a great blue beach. She paused after an incline to heave a sigh of exhaustion for she had an immense weight to carry around and she was not as young as she used to be. At times she could feel her heart, like a child's fist, clenching and unclenching inside her chest, and when the feeling came, it stopped her thought altogether and she would go about like a large hull of herself, moving for no reason; but she gained this incline without a tremor and stood at the top of it, pleased with  herself. Suddenly while she watched, the sky folded back in two pieces like the curtain to a stage and a gigantic figure stood facing her. It was the color of the sun in the early afternoon, white-gold. It was of no definite shape but there were fiery wheels with fierce dark eyes in them, spinning rapidly all around it. She was not able to tell if the figure was going forward or backward because its magnificence was so great. She shut her eyes in order to look at it and it turned blood-red and the wheels turned white. A voice, very resonant, said the one word, "Prophesy!"  She stood there, tottering slightly but still upright, her eyes shut tight and her fists clenched and her straw sun hat low on her forehead. "The children of wicked nations will be butchered," she said in a loud voice. "Legs where arms should be, foot to face, ear in the palm of hand. Who will remain whole? Who will remain whole? Who?"  Presently she opened her eyes. The sky was full of white fish carried lazily on their sides by some invisible current and pieces of the sun, submerged some distance beyond them, appeared from time to time as if they were being washed in the opposite direction. Woodenly she planted one foot in front of the other until she had crossed the pasture and reached the lot. She walked through the barn like one in a daze and did not speak to Mr. Shortley. She continued up the road until she saw the priest's car  parked in front of Mrs. McIntyre's house. "Here again," she muttered. "Come to destroy."  Mrs. McIntyre and the priest were walking in the yard. In order not to meet them face to face, she turned to the left and entered the feed house, a single-room shack piled on one side with flowered sacks of scratch feed. There were spilled oyster shells in one corner and a few old dirty calendars on the wall, advertising calf feed and various patent medicine remedies. One showed a bearded gentleman in a frock coat, holding up a bottle, and beneath his feet was the inscription, "I have been made regular by this marvelous disco very!" Mrs. Shortley had always felt close to this man as if he were some distinguished person she was acquainted with but now her mind was on nothing but the dangerous presence of the priest. She stationed herself at a crack between two boards where she could look out and see him and Mrs. McIntyre strolling toward the turkey brooder, which was placed just outside the feed house.  "Arrrrr!" he said as they approached the brooder. "Look at the little biddies!" and he stooped and squinted through the wire.  Mrs. Shortley's mouth twisted.  "Do you think the Guizacs will want to leave me?" Mrs. McIntyre asked. "Do you think they'll go to Chicago or some place like that?"   "And why should they do that now?" asked the priest, wiggling his finger at a turkey, his big nose close to the wire.  "Money," Mrs. McIntyre said.  "Arrrr, give them some morrre then," he said indifferently. "They have to get along."  "So do I," Mrs. McIntyre muttered. "It means I'm going to have to get rid o?some of these others."  "And arrre the Shortleys satisfactory?" he inquired, paying more attention to the turkeys than to her.  "Five times in the last month I've found Mr. Shortley smoking in the barn," Mrs. McIntyre said. "Five times."  "And arrre the Negroes any better?"  "They lie and steal and have to be watched all the time," she said.  "Tsk, tsk," he said. "Which will you discharge?"  "I've decided to give Mr. Shortley his month's notice tomorrow," Mrs. McIntyre said.  The priest scarcely seemed to hear her he was so busy wiggling his finger inside the wire. Mrs. Shortley sat down on an open sack of laying mash with a dead thump that sent feed dust clouding up around her. She found herself looking straight ahead at the opposite wall where the  gentleman on the calendar was holding up his marvelous discovery but she didn't see him. She looked ahead as if she saw nothing whatsoever. Then she rose and ran to her house. Her face was an almost volcanic red.  She opened all the drawers and dragged out boxes and old battered suitcases from under the bed. She began to unload the drawers into the boxes, all the time without pause, without taking off the sunhat she had on her head. She set the two girls to doing the same. When Mr. Shortley came in, she did not even look at him but merely pointed one arm at him while she packed with the other. "Bring the car around to the back door," she said. "You ain't waiting to be fired!"  Mr. Shortley had never in his life doubted her omniscience. He perceived the entire situation in half a second and, with only a sour scowl, retreated out the door and went to drive the automobile around to the back.  They tied the two iron beds to the top of the car and the two rocking chairs inside the beds and rolled the two mattresses up between the rocking chairs. On top of this they tied a crate of chickens. They loaded the inside of the car with the old suitcases and boxes, leaving a small space for Annie Maude and Sarah Mae. It took them the rest of the afternoon and half the night to do this but Mrs. Shortley was determined  that they would leave before four o'clock in the morning, that Mr. Shortley should not adjust another milking machine on this place. All the time she had been working, her face was changing rapidly from red to white and back again.  Just before dawn, as it began to drizzle rain, they were ready to leave. They all got in the car and sat there cramped up between boxes and bundles and rolls of bedding. The square black automobile moved off with more than its customary grinding noises as if it were protesting the load. In the back, the two long bony yellow-haired girls were sitting on a pile of boxes and there was a beagle hound puppy and a cat with two kittens somewhere under the blankets. The car moved slowly, like some overfreighted leaking ark, away from their shack and past the white house where Mrs. McIntyre was sleeping soundly -- hardly guessing that her cows would not be milked by Mr. Shortley that morning -- and past the Pole's shack on top of the hill and on down the road to the gate where the two Negroes were walking, one behind the other, on their way to help with the milking. They looked straight at the car and its occupants but even as the dim yellow headlights lit up their faces, they politely did not seem to see anything, or anyhow, to attach significance to what was there. The loaded car might have been passing mist in the early morning  half-light. They continued up the road at the same even pace without looking back.  A dark yellow sun was beginning to rise in a sky that was the same slick dark gray as the highway. The fields stretched away, stiff and weedy, on either side. "Where we goin?" Mr. Shortley asked for the first time.  Mrs. Shortley sat with one foot on a packing box so that her knee was pushed into her stomach. Mr. Shortley's elbow was almost under her nose and Sarah Mae's bare left foot was sticking over the front seat, touching her ear.  "Where we goin?" Mr. Shortley repeated and when she didn't answer again, he turned and looked at her.  Fierce heat seemed to be swelling slowly and fully into her face as if it were welling up now for a final assault. She was sitting in an erect way in spite of the fact that one leg was twisted under her and one knee was almost into her neck, but there was a peculiar lack of light in her icy blue eyes. All the vision in them might have been turned around, looking inside her. She suddenly grabbed Mr. Shortley's elbow and Sarah Mae's foot at the same time and began to tug and pull on them as if she were trying to fit the two extra limbs onto herself.  Mr. Shortley began to curse and quickly stopped the car and Sarah  Mae yelled to quit but Mrs. Shortley apparently intended to rearrange the whole car at once. She thrashed forward and backward, clutching at everything she could get her hands on and hugging it to herself, Mr. Shortley's head, Sarah Mae's leg, the cat, a wad of white bedding, her own big moon-like knee; then all at once her fierce expression faded into a look of astonishment and her grip on what she had loosened. One of her eyes drew near to the other and seemed to collapse quietly and she was still.  The two girls, who didn't know what had happened to her, began to say, "Where we goin, Ma? Where we goin?" They thought she was playing a joke and that their father, staring straight ahead at her, was imitating a dead man. They didn't know that she had had a great experience or ever been displaced in the world from all that belonged to her. They were frightened by the gray slick road before them and they kept repeating in higher and higher voices, "Where we goin, Ma? Where we goin?" while their mother, her huge body rolled back still against the seat and her eyes like blue-painted glass, seemed to contemplate for the first time the tremendous frontiers of her true country.   II  "Well," Mrs. McIntyre said to the old Negro, "we can get along without them. We've seen them come and seen them go -- black and white." She was standing in the calf barn while he cleaned it and she held a rake in her hand and now and then pulled a corn cob from a corner or pointed to a soggy spot that he had missed. When she discovered the Shortleys were gone, she was delighted as it meant she wouldn't have to fire them. The people she hired always left her -- because they were that kind of people. Of all the families she had had, the Shortleys were the best if she didn't count the Displaced Person. They had been not quite trash; Mrs. Shortley was a good woman, and she would miss her but as the Judge used to say, you couldn't have your pie and eat it too, and she was satisfied with the D. P. "We've seen them come and seen them go," she repeated with satisfaction.  "And me and you," the old man said, stooping to drag his hoe under a feed rack, "is still here."   She caught exactly what he meant her to catch in his tone. Bars of sunlight fell from the cracked ceiling across his back and cut him in three distinct parts. She watched his long hands clenched around the hoe and his crooked old profile pushed close to them. You might have been here _before_ I was, she said to herself, but it's mighty likely I'll be here when you're gone. "I've spent half my life fooling with worthless people," she said in a severe voice, "but now I'm through."  "Black and white," he said, "is the same."  "I am through," she repeated and gave her dark smock that she had thrown over her shoulders like a cape a quick snatch at the neck. She had on a broad-brimmed black straw hat that had cost her twenty dollars twenty years ago and that she used now for a sunhat. "Money is the root of all evil," she said. "The Judge said so every day. He said he deplored money. He said the reason you niggers were so uppity was because there was so much money in circulation."  The old Negro had known the Judge. "Judge say he long for the day when he be too poor to pay a nigger to work," he said. "Say when that day come, the world be back on its feet."  She leaned forward, her hands on her hips and her neck stretched and said, "Well that day has almost come around here and I'm telling each and  every one of you: you better look sharp. I don't have to put up with foolishness any more. I have somebody now who _has_ to work!"  The old man knew when to answer and when not. At length he said, "We seen them come and we seen them go."  "However, the Shortleys were not the worst by far," she said. "I well remember those Garrits."  "They was before them Collinses," he said.  "No, before the Ringfields."  "Sweet Lord, them Ringfields!" he murmured.  "None of that kind _want_ to work," she said.  "We seen them come and we seen them go," he said as if this were a refrain. "But we ain't never had one before," he said, bending himself up until he faced her, "like what we got now." He was cinnamon-colored with eyes that were so blurred with age that they seemed to be hung behind cobwebs.  She gave him an intense stare and held it until, lowering his hands on the hoe, he bent down again and dragged a pile of shavings alongside the wheelbarrow. She said stiffly, "He can wash out that barn in the time it took Mr. Shortley to make up his mind he had to do it."  "He from Pole," the old man muttered.   "From Poland."  "In Pole it ain't like it is here," he said. "They got different ways of doing," and he began to mumble unintelligibly.  "What are you saying?" she said. "If you have anything to say about him, say it and say it aloud."  He was silent, bending his knees precariously and edging the rake along the underside of the trough.  "If you know anything he's done that he shouldn't, I expect you to report it to me," she said.  "It warn't like it was what he should ought or oughtn't," he muttered. "It was like what nobody else don't do."  "You don't have anything against him," she said shortly, "and he's here to stay."  "We ain't never had one like him before is all," he murmured and gave his polite laugh.  "Times are changing," she said. "Do you know what's happening to this world? It's swelling up. It's getting so full of people that only the smart thrifty energetic ones are going to survive," and she tapped the words, smart, thrifty, and energetic out on the palm of her hand. Through the far end of the stall she could see down the road to where the  Displaced Person was standing in the open barn door with the green hose in his hand. There was a certain stiffness about his figure that seemed to make it necessary for her to approach him slowly, even in her thoughts. She had decided this was because she couldn't hold an easy conversation with him. Whenever she said anything to him, she found herself shouting and nodding extravagantly and she would be conscious that one of the Negroes was leaning behind the nearest shed, watching.  "No indeed!" she said, sitting down on one of the feed racks and folding her arms, "I've made up my mind that I've had enough trashy people on this place to last me a lifetime and I'm not going to spend my last years fooling with Shortleys and Ringfields and Collins when the world is full of people who _have_ to work."  "Howcome they so many extra?" he asked.  "People are selfish," she said. "They have too many children. There's no sense in it any more."  He had picked up the wheelbarrow handles and was backing out the door and he paused, half in the sunlight and half out, and stood there chewing his gums as if he had forgotten which direction he wanted to move in.  "What you colored people don't realize," she said, "is that I'm the one  around here who holds all the strings together. If you don't work, I don't make any money and I can't pay you. You're all dependent on me but you each and every one act like the shoe is on the other foot."  It was not possible to tell from his face if he heard her. Finally he backed out with the wheelbarrow. "Judge say the devil he know is better than the devil he don't," he said in a clear mutter and turned and trundled off.  She got up and followed him, a deep vertical pit appearing suddenly in the center of her forehead, just under the red bangs. "The Judge has long since ceased to pay the bills around here," she called in a piercing voice.  He was the only one of her Negroes who had known the Judge and he thought this gave him title. He had had a low opinion of Mr. Crooms and Mr. McIntyre, her other husbands, and in his veiled polite way, he had congratulated her after each of her divorces. When he thought it necessary, he would work under a window where he knew she was sitting and talk to himself, a careful roundabout discussion, question and answer and then refrain. Once she had got up silently and slammed the window down so hard that he had fallen backwards off his feet. Or occasionally he spoke with the peacock. The cock would follow him around the place, his  steady eye on the ear of corn that stuck up from the old man's back pocket or he would sit near him and pick himself. Once from the open kitchen door, she had heard him say to the bird, "I remember when it was twenty of you walking about this place and now it's only you and two hens. Crooms it was twelve. McIntyre it was five. You and two hens now."  And that time she had stepped out of the door onto the porch and said, "MISTER Crooms and MISTER McIntyre! And I don't want to hear you call either of them anything else again. And you can understand this: when that peachicken dies there won't be any replacements."  She kept the peacock only out of a superstitious fear of annoying the Judge in his grave. He had liked to see them walking around the place for he said they made him feel rich. Of her three husbands, the Judge was the one most present to her although he was the only one she had buried. He was in the family graveyard, a little space fenced in the middle of the back cornfield, with his mother and father and grandfather and three great aunts and two infant cousins. Mr. Crooms, her second, was forty miles away in the state asylum and Mr. McIntyre, her last, was intoxicated, she supposed, in some hotel room in Florida. But the Judge, sunk in the cornfield with his family, was always at home.  She had married him when he was an old man and because of his  money but there had been another reason that she would not admit then, even to herself: she had liked him. He was a dirty snuff-dipping Court House figure, famous all over the county for being rich, who wore high-top shoes, a string tie, a gray suit with a black stripe in it, and a yellowed panama hat, winter and summer. His teeth and hair were tobacco-colored and his face a clay pink pitted and tracked with mysterious prehistoric-looking marks as if he had been unearthed among fossils. There had been a peculiar odor about him of sweaty fondled bills but he never carried money on him or had a nickel to show. She was his secretary for a few months and the old man with his sharp eye had seen at once that here was a woman who admired him for himself. The three years that he lived after they married were the happiest and most prosperous of Mrs. McIntyre's life, but when he died his estate proved to be bankrupt. He left her a mortgaged house and fifty acres that he had managed to cut the timber off before he died. It was as if, as the final triumph of a successful life, he had been able to take everything with him.  But she had survived. She had survived a succession of tenant farmers and dairymen that the old man himself would have found hard to outdo, and she had been able to meet the constant drain of a tribe of moody unpredictable Negroes, and she had even managed to hold her own  against the incidental bloodsuckers, the cattle dealers and lumber men and the buyers and sellers of anything who drove up in pieced-together trucks and honked in the yard.  She stood slightly reared back with her arms folded under her smock and a satisfied expression on her face as she watched the Displaced Person turn off the hose and disappear inside the barn. She was sorry that the poor man had been chased out of Poland and run across Europe and had had to take up in a tenant shack in a strange country, but she had not been responsible for any of this. She had had a hard time herself. She knew what it was to struggle. People ought to have to struggle. Mr. Guizac had probably had everything given to him all the way across Europe and over here. He had probably not had to struggle enough. She had given him a job. She didn't know if he was grateful or not. She didn't know anything about him except that he did the work. The truth was that he was not very real to her yet. He was a kind of miracle that she had seen happen and that she talked about but that she still didn't believe.  She watched as he came out of the barn and motioned to Sulk, who was coming around the back of the lot. He gesticulated and then took something out of his pocket and the two of them stood looking at it. She started down the lane toward them. The Negro's figure was slack and tall  and he was craning his round head forward in his usual idiotic way. He was a little better than half-witted but when they were like that they were always good workers. The Judge had said always hire you a half-witted nigger because they don't have sense enough to stop working. The Pole was gesticulating rapidly. He left something with the colored boy and then walked off and before she rounded the turn in the lane, she heard the tractor crank up. He was on his way to the field. The Negro was still hanging there, gaping at whatever he had in his hand.  She entered the lot and walked through the barn, looking with approval at the wet spotless concrete floor. It was only nine-thirty and Mr. Shortley had never got anything washed until eleven. As she came out at the other end, she saw the Negro moving very slowly in a diagonal path across the road in front of her, his eyes still on what Mr. Guizac had given him. He didn't see her and he paused and dipped his knees and leaned over his hand, his tongue describing little circles. He had a photograph. He lifted one finger and traced it lightly over the surface of the picture. Then he looked up and saw her and seemed to freeze, his mouth in a half-grin, his finger lifted.  "Why haven't you gone to the field?" she asked.  He raised one foot and opened his mouth wider while the hand with  the photograph edged toward his back pocket.  "What's that?" she said.  "It ain't nothin," he muttered and handed it to her automatically.  It was a photograph of a girl of about twelve in a white dress. She had blond hair with a wreath in it and she looked forward out of light eyes that were bland and composed. "Who is this child?" Mrs. McIntyre asked.  "She his cousin," the boy said in a high voice.  "Well what are you doing with it?" she asked.  "She going to mah me," he said in an even higher voice.  "Marry you!" she shrieked.  "I pays half to get her over here," he said. "I pays him three dollar a week. She bigger now. She his cousin. She don't care who she mah she so glad to get away from there." The high voice seemed to shoot up like a nervous jet of sound and then fall flat as he watched her face. Her eyes were the color of blue granite when the glare falls on it, but she was not looking at him. She was looking down the road where the distant sound of the tractor could be heard.  "I don't reckon she goin to come nohow," the boy murmured.  "I'll see that you get every cent of your money back," she said in a toneless voice and turned and walked off, holding the photograph bent in  two. There was nothing about her small stiff figure to indicate that she was shaken.  As soon as she got in the house, she lay down on her bed and shut her eyes and pressed her hand over her heart as if she were trying to keep it in place. Her mouth opened and she made two or three dry little sounds. Then after a minute she sat up and said aloud, "They're all the same. It's always been like this," and she fell back flat again. "Twenty years of being beaten and done in and they even robbed his grave!" and remembering that, she began to cry quietly, wiping her eyes every now and then with the hem of her smock.  What she had thought of was the angel over the Judge's grave. This had been a naked granite cherub that the old man had seen in the city one day in a tombstone store window. He had been taken with it at once, partly because its face reminded him of his wife and partly because he wanted a genuine work of art over his grave. He had come home with it sitting on the green plush train seat beside him. Mrs. McIntyre had never noticed the resemblance to herself. She had always thought it hideous but when the Herrins stole it off the old man's grave, she was shocked and outraged. Mrs. Herrin had thought it very pretty and had walked to the graveyard frequently to see it, and when the Herrins left the angel left  with them, all but its toes, for the ax old man Herrin had used to break it off with had struck slightly too high. Mrs. McIntyre had never been able to afford to have it replaced.  When she had cried all she could, she got up and went into the back hall, a closet-like space that was dark and quiet as a chapel and sat down on the edge of the Judge's black mechanical chair with her elbow on his desk. This was a giant roll-top piece of furniture pocked with pigeon holes full of dusty papers. Old bankbooks and ledgers were stacked in the half-open drawers and there was a small safe, empty but locked, set like a tabernacle in the center of it. She had left this part of the house unchanged since the old man's time. It was a kind of memorial to him, sacred because he had conducted his business here. With the slightest tilt one way or the other, the chair gave a rusty skeletal groan that sounded something like him when he had complained of his poverty. It had been his first principle to talk as if he were the poorest man in the world and she followed it, not only because he had but because it was true. When she sat with her intense constricted face turned toward the empty safe, she knew there was nobody poorer in the world than she was.  She sat motionless at the desk for ten or fifteen minutes and then as if she had gained some strength, she got up and got in her car and drove to  the cornfield.  The road ran through a shadowy pine thicket and ended on top of a hill that rolled fan-wise down and up again in a broad expanse of tasseled green. Mr. Guizac was cutting from the outside of the field in a circular path to the center where the graveyard was all but hidden by the corn, and she could see him on the high far side of the slope, mounted on the tractor with the cutter and wagon behind him. From time to time, he had to get off the tractor and climb in the wagon to spread the silage because the Negro had not arrived. She watched impatiently, standing in front of her black coupe with her arms folded under her smock, while he progressed slowly around the rim of the field, gradually getting close enough for her to wave to him to get down. He stopped the machine and jumped off and came running forward, wiping his red jaw with a piece of grease rag.  "I want to talk to you," she said and beckoned him to the edge of the thicket where it was shady. He took off the cap and followed her, smiling, but his smile faded when she turned and faced him. Her eyebrows, thin and fierce as a spider's leg, had drawn together ominously and the deep vertical pit had plunged down from under the red bangs into the bridge of her nose. She removed the bent picture from her pocket and handed it to him silently. Then she stepped back and said, "Mr. Guizac! You would  bring this poor innocent child over here and try to marry her to a half-witted thieving black stinking niggerl What kind of a monster are you!"  He took the photograph with a slowly returning smile. "My cousin," he said. "She twelve here. First Communion. Six-ten now."  Monster! she said to herself and looked at him as if she were seeing him for the first time. His forehead and skull were white where they had been protected by his cap but the rest of his face was red and bristled with short yellow hairs. His eyes were like two bright nails behind his gold-rimmed spectacles that had been mended over the nose with haywire. His whole face looked as if it might have been patched together out of several others. "Mr. Guizac," she said, beginning slowly and then speaking faster until she ended breathless in the middle of a word, "that nigger cannot have a white wife from Europe. You can't talk to a nigger that way. You'll excite him and besides it can't be done. Maybe it can be done in Poland but it can't be done here and you'll have to stop. It's all foolishness. That nigger don't have a grain of sense and you'll excite . . ."  "She in camp three year," he said.  "Your cousin," she said in a positive voice, "cannot come over here and marry one of my Negroes."   "She six-ten year," he said. "From Poland. Mamma die, pappa die. She wait in camp. Three camp." He pulled a wallet from his pocket and fingered through it and took out another picture of the same girl, a few years older, dressed in something dark and shapeless. She was standing against a wall with a short woman who apparently had no teeth. "She mamma," he said, pointing to the woman. "She die in two camp."  "Mr. Guizac," Mrs. McIntyre said, pushing the picture back at him, "I will not have my niggers upset. I cannot run this place without my niggers. I can run it without you but not without them and if you mention this girl to Sulk again, you won't have a job with me. Do you understand?"  His face showed no comprehension. He seemed to be piecing all these words together in his mind to make a thought.  Mrs. McIntyre remembered Mrs. Shortley's words: "He understands everything, he only pretends he don't so as to do exactly as he pleases," and her face regained the look of shocked wrath she had begun with. "I cannot understand how a man who calls himself a Christian," she said, "could bring a poor innocent girl over here and marry her to something like that. I cannot understand it. I cannot!" and she shook her head and looked into the distance with a pained blue gaze.   After a second he shrugged and let his arms drop as if he were tired. "She no care black," he said. "She in camp three year."  Mrs. McIntyre felt a peculiar weakness behind her knees. "Mr. Guizac," she said, "I don't want to have, to speak to you about this again. If I do, you'll have to find another place yourself, Do you understand?"  The patched face did not say. She had the impression that he didn't see her there. "This is my place," she said. "I say who will come here and who won't."  "Ya," he said and put back on his cap.  "I am not responsible for the world's misery," she said as an afterthought.  "Ya," he said.  "You have a good job. You should be grateful to be here," she added, "but I'm not sure you are."  "Ya," he said and gave his little shrug and turned back to the tractor.  She watched him get on and maneuver the machine into the corn again. When he had passed her and rounded the turn, she climbed to the top of the slope and stood with her arms folded and looked out grimly over the field. "They're all the same," she muttered, "whether they come from Poland or Tennessee. I've handled Herrins and Ringfields and  Shortleys and I can handle a Guizac," and she narrowed her gaze until it closed entirely around the diminishing figure on the tractor as if she were watching him through a gunsight. All her life she had been fighting the world's overflow and now she had it in the form of a Pole. "You're just like all the rest of them," she said, "-- only smart and thrifty and energetic but so am I. And this is my place," and she stood there, a small black-hatted, black-smocked figure with an aging cherubic face, and folded her arms as if she were equal to anything. But her heart was beating as if some interior violence had already been done to her. She opened her eyes to include the whole field so that the figure on the tractor was no larger than a grasshopper in her widened view.  She stood there for some time. There was a slight breeze and the corn trembled in great waves on both sides of the slope. The big cutter, with its monotonous roar, continued to shoot it pulverized into the wagon in a steady spurt of fodder. By nightfall, the Displaced Person would have worked his way around and around until there would be nothing on either side of the two hills but the stubble, and down in the center, risen like a little island, the graveyard where the Judge lay grinning under his desecrated monument.   III  The priest, with his long bland face supported on one finger, had been talking for ten minutes about Purgatory while Mrs. McIntyre squinted furiously at him from an opposite chair. They were drinking ginger ale on her front porch and she had kept rattling the ice in her glass, rattling her beads, rattling her bracelet like an impatient pony jingling its harness. There is no moral obligation to keep him, she was saying under her breath, there is absolutely no moral obligation. Suddenly she lurched up and her voice fell across his brogue like a drill into a mechanical saw. "Listen!" she said, "I'm not theological. I'm practical! I want to talk to you about something practical!"  "Arrrrrrr," he groaned, grating to a halt.  She had put at least a finger of whisky in her own ginger ale so that she would be able to endure his full-length visit and she sat down awkwardly, finding the chair closer to her than she had expected. "Mr.  Guizac is not satisfactory," she said.  The old man raised his eyebrows in mock wonder.  "He's extra," she said. "He doesn't fit in. I have to have somebody who fits in."  The priest carefully turned his hat on his knees. He had a little trick of waiting a second silently and then swinging the conversation back into his own paths. He was about eighty. She had never known a priest until she had gone to see this one on the business of getting her the Displaced Person. After he had got her the Pole, he had used the business introduction to try to convert her -- just as she had supposed he would.  "Give him time," the old man said. "He'll learn to fit in. Where is that beautiful birrrrd of yours?" he asked and then said, "Arrrrr, I see him!" and stood up and looked out over the lawn where the peacock and the two hens were stepping at a strained attention, their long necks ruffled, the cock's violent blue and the hens' silver-green, glinting in the late afternoon sun.  "Mr. Guizac," Mrs. McIntyre continued, bearing down with a flat steady voice, "is very efficient. I'll admit that. But he doesn't understand how to get on with my niggers and they don't like him. I can't have my niggers run off. And I don't like his attitude. He's not in the least grateful  for being here."  The priest had his hand on the screen door and he opened it, ready to make his escape. "Arrrr, I must be off," he murmured.  "I tell you if I had a white man who understood the Negroes, I'd have to let Mr. Guizac go," she said and stood up again.  He turned then and looked her in the face. "He has nowhere to go," he said. Then he said, "Dear lady, I know you well enough to know you wouldn't turn him out for a trifle!" and without waiting for an answer, he raised his hand and gave her his blessing in a rumbling voice.  She smiled angrily and said, "I didn't create his situation, of course."  The priest let his eyes wander toward the birds. They had reached the middle of the lawn. The cock stopped suddenly and curving his neck backwards, he raised his tail and spread it with a shimmering timbrous noise. Tiers of small pregnant suns floated in a green-gold haze over his head. The priest stood transfixed, his jaw slack Mrs. McIntyre wondered where she had ever seen such an idiotic old man. "Christ will come like that!" he said in a loud gay voice and wiped his hand over his mouth and stood there, gaping.  Mrs. McIntyre's face assumed a set puritanical expression and she reddened. Christ in the conversation embarrassed her the way sex had her  mother. "It is not my responsibility that Mr. Guizac has nowhere to go," she said. "I don't find myself responsible for all the extra people in the world."  The old man didn't seem to hear her. His attention was fixed on the cock who was taking minute steps backward, his head against the spread tail. "The Transfiguration," he murmured.  She had no idea what he was talking about. "Mr. Guizac didn't have to come here in the first place," she said, giving him a hard look.  The cock lowered his tail and began to pick grass.  "He didn't have to come in the first place," she repeated, emphasizing each word.  The old man smiled absently. "He came to redeem us," he said and blandly reached for her hand and shook it and said he must go.  If Mr. Shortley had not returned a few weeks later, she would have gone out looking for a new man to hire. She had not wanted him back but when she saw the familiar black automobile drive up the road and stop by the side of the house, she had the feeling that she was the one returning, after a long miserable trip, to her own place. She realized all at once that  it was Mrs. Shortley she had been missing. She had had no one to talk to since Mrs. Shortley left, and she ran to the door, expecting to see her heaving herself up the steps.  Mr. Shortley stood there alone. He had on a black felt hat and a shirt with red and blue palm trees designed in it but the hollows in his long bitten blistered face were deeper than they had been a month ago.  "Well!" she said. "Where is Mrs. Shortley?"  Mr. Shortley didn't say anything. The change in his face seemed to have come from the inside; he looked like a man who had gone for a long time without water. "She was God's own angel," he said in a loud voice. "She was the sweetest woman in the world."  "Where is she?" Mrs. McIntyre murmured.  "Daid," he said. "She had herself a stroke on the day she left out of here." There was a corpse-like composure about his face "I figure that Pole killed her," he said. "She seen through him from the first. She known he come from the devil. She told me so."  It took Mrs. McIntyre three days to get over Mrs. Shortley's death. She told herself that anyone would have thought they were kin. She rehired Mr. Shortley to do farm work though actually she didn't want him without his wife. She told him she was going to give thirty days' notice to  the Displaced Person at the end of the month and that then he could have his job back in the dairy. Mr. Shortley preferred the dairy job but he was willing to wait. He said it would give him some satisfaction to see the Pole leave the place, and Mrs. McIntyre said it would give her a great deal of satisfaction. She confessed that she should have been content with the help she had in the first place and not have been reaching into other parts of the world for it. Mr. Shortley said he never had cared for foreigners since he had been in the first world's war and seen what they were like. He said he had seen all kinds then but that none of them were like us. He said he recalled the face of one man who had thrown a hand-grenade at him and that the man had had little round eye-glasses exactly like Mr. Guizac's.  "But Mr. Guizac is a Pole, he's not a German," Mrs. McIntyre said.  "It ain't a great deal of difference in them two kinds," Mr. Shortley had explained.  The Negroes were pleased to see Mr. Shortley back. The Displaced Person had expected them to work as hard as he worked himself, whereas Mr. Shortley recognized their limitations. He had never been a very good worker himself with Mrs. Shortley to keep him in line, but without her, he was even more forgetful and slow. The Pole worked as fiercely as ever  and seemed to have no inkling that he was about to be fired. Mrs. McIntyre saw jobs done in a short time that she had thought would never get done at all. Still she was resolved to get rid of him. The sight of his small stiff figure moving quickly here and there had come to be the most irritating sight on the place for her, and she felt she had been tricked by the old priest. He had said there was no legal obligation for her to keep the Displaced Person if he was not satisfactory, but then he had brought up the moral one.  She meant to tell him that _her_ moral obligation was to her own people, to Mr. Shortley, who had fought in the world war for his country and not to Mr. Guizac who had merely arrived here to take advantage of whatever he could. She felt she must have this out with the priest before she fired the Displaced Person. When the first of the month came and the priest hadn't called, she put off giving the Pole notice for a little longer.  Mr. Shortley told himself that he should have known all along that no woman was going to do what she said she was when she said she was. He didn't know how long he could afford to put up with her shilly-shallying. He thought himself that she was going soft and was afraid to turn the Pole out for fear he would have a hard time getting another place. He could tell her the truth about this: that if she let him go, in three years he would own  his own house and have a television aerial sitting on top of it. As a matter of policy, Mr. Shortley began to come to her back door every evening to put certain facts before her. "A white man sometimes don't get the consideration a nigger gets," he said, "but that don't matter because he's still white, but sometimes," and here he would pause and look off into the distance, "a man that's fought and bled and died in the service of his native land don't get the consideration of one of them like them he was fighting. I ast you: is that right?" When he asked her such questions he could watch her face and tell he was making an impression. She didn't look too well these days. He noticed lines around her eyes that hadn't been there when he and Mrs. Shortley had been the only white help on the place. Whenever he thought of Mrs. Shortley, he felt his heart go down like an old bucket into a dry well.  The old priest kept away as if he had been frightened by his last visit but finally, seeing that the Displaced Person had not been fired, he ventured to call again to take up giving Mrs. McIntyre instructions where he remembered leaving them off. She had not asked to be instructed but he instructed anyway, forcing a little definition of one of the sacraments or of some dogma into each conversation he had, no matter with whom. He sat on her porch, taking no notice of her partly mocking, partly  outraged expression as she sat shaking her foot, waiting for an opportunity to drive a wedge into his talk. "For," he was saying, as if he spoke of something that had happened yesterday in town, "when God sent his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ Our Lord" -- he slightly bowed his head -- "as a Redeemer to mankind, He . . ."  "Father Flynn!" she said in a voice that made him jump. "I want to talk to you about something serious!"  The skin under the old man's right eye flinched.  "As far as I'm concerned," she said and glared at him fiercely, "Christ was just another D. P."  He raised his hands slightly and let them drop on his knees. "Arrrrrr," he murmured as if he were considering this.  "I'm going to let that man go," she said. "I don't have any obligation to him. My obligation is to the people who've done something for their country, not to the ones who've just come over to take advantage of what they can get," and she began to talk rapidly, remembering all her arguments. The priest's attention seemed to retire to some private oratory to wait until she got through. Once or twice his gaze roved out onto the lawn as if he were hunting some means of escape but she didn't stop. She told him how she had been hanging onto this place for thirty years,  always just barely making it against people who came from nowhere and were going nowhere, who didn't want anything but an automobile. She said she had found out they were the same whether they came from Poland or Tennessee. When the Guizacs got ready, she said, they would not hesitate to leave her. She told him how the people who looked rich were the poorest of all because they had the most to keep up. She asked him how he thought she paid her feed bills. She told him she would like to have her house done over but she couldn't afford it. She couldn't even afford to have the monument restored over her husband's grave. She asked him if he would like to guess what her insurance amounted to for the year. Finally she asked him if he thought she was made of money and the old man suddenly let out a great ugly bellow as if this were a comical question.  When the visit was over, she felt let down, though she had clearly triumphed over him. She made up her mind now that on the first of the month, she would give the Displaced Person his thirty days' notice and she told Mr. Shortley so.  Mr. Shortley didn't say anything. His wife had been the only woman he was ever acquainted with who was never scared off from doing what she said. She said the Pole had been sent by the devil and the priest. Mr.  Shortley had no doubt that the priest had got some peculiar control over Mrs. McIntyre and that before long she would start attending his Masses. She looked as if something was wearing her down from the inside. She was thinner and more fidgety and not as sharp as she used to be. She would look at a milk can now and not see how dirty it was and he had seen her lips move when she was not talking. The Pole never did anything the wrong way but all the same he was very irritating to her. Mr. Shortley himself did things as he pleased -- not always her way -- but she didn't seem to notice. She had noticed though that the Pole and all his family were getting fat; she pointed out to Mr. Shortley that the hollows had come out of their cheeks and that they saved every cent they made. "Yes'm, and one of these days he'll be able to buy and sell you out," Mr. Shortley had ventured to say, and he could tell that the statement had shaken her.  "I'm just waiting for the first," she had said.  Mr. Shortley waited too and the first came and went and she didn't fire him. He could have told anybody how it would be. He was not a violent man but he hated to see a woman done in by a foreigner. He felt that that was one thing a man couldn't stand by and see happen.  There was no reason Mrs. McIntyre should not fire Mr. Guizac at  once but she put it off from day to day. She was worried about her bills and about her health. She didn't sleep at night or when she did she dreamed about the Displaced Person. She had never discharged any one before; they had all left her. One night she dreamed that Mr. Guizac and his family were moving into her house and that she was moving in with Mr. Shortley. This was too much for her and she woke up and didn't sleep again for several nights; and one night she dreamed that the priest came to call and droned on and on, saying, "Dear lady, I know your tender heart won't suffer you to turn the porrrrr man out. Think of the thousands of them, think of the ovens and the boxcars and the camps and the sick children and Christ Our Lord."  "He's extra and he's upset the balance around here," she said, "and I'm a logical practical woman and there are no ovens here and no camps and no Christ Our Lord and when he leaves, he'll make more money. He'll work at the mill and buy a car and don't talk to me -- all they want is a car."  "The ovens and the boxcars and the sick children," droned the priest, "and our dear Lord."  "Just one too many," she said.  The next morning, she made up her mind while she was eating her  breakfast that she would give him his notice at once, and she stood up and walked out of the kitchen and down the road with her table napkin still in her hand. Mr. Guizac was spraying the barn, standing in his sway-backed way with one hand on his hip. He turned off the hose and gave her an impatient kind of attention as if she were interfering with his work. She had not thought of what she would say to him, she had merely come. She stood in the barn door, looking severely at the wet spotless floor and the dripping stanchions. "Ya goot?" he said.  "Mr. Guizac," she said, "I can barely meet my obligations now." Then she said in a louder, stronger voice, emphasizing each word, "I have bills to pay."  "I too," Mr. Guizac said. "Much bills, little money," and he shrugged.  At the other end of the barn, she saw a long beak-nosed shadow glide like a snake halfway up the sunlit open door and stop; and somewhere behind her, she was aware of a silence where the sound of the Negroes shoveling had come a minute before. "This is my place," she said angrily. "All of you are extra. Each and every one of you are extra!"  "Ya," Mr. Guizac said and turned on the hose again.  She wiped her mouth with the napkin she had in her hand and walked off, as if she had accomplished what she came for.   Mr. Shortley's shadow withdrew from the door and he leaned against the side of the barn and lit half of a cigarette that he took out of his pocket. There was nothing for him to do now but wait on the hand of God to strike, but he knew one thing: he was not going to wait with his mouth shut.  Starting that morning, he began to complain and to state his side of the case to every person he saw, black or white. He complained in the grocery store and at the courthouse and on the street corner and directly to Mrs. McIntyre herself, for there was nothing underhanded about him. If the Pole could have understood what he had to say, he would have said it to him too. "All men was created free and equal," he said to Mrs. McIntyre, "and I risked my life and limb to prove it. Gone over there and fought and bled and died and come back on over here and find out who's got my job -- just exactly who I been fighting. It was a hand-grenade come that near to killing me and I seen who throwed it -- little man with eye-glasses just like his. Might have bought them at the same store. Small world," and he gave a bitter little laugh. Since he didn't have Mrs. Shortley to do the talking any more, he had started doing it himself and had found that he had a gift for it. He had the power of making other people see his logic. He talked a good deal to the Negroes.   "Whyn't you go back to Africa?" he asked Sulk one morning as they were cleaning out the silo. "That's your country, ain't it?"  "I ain't goin there," the boy said. "They might eat me up."  "Well, if you behave yourself it isn't any reason you can't stay here," Mr. Shortley said kindly. "Because you didn't run away from nowhere. Your granddaddy was brought. He didn't have a thing to do with coming. It's the people that run away from where they come from that I ain't got any use for."  "I never felt no need to travel," the Negro said.  "Well," Mr. Shortley said, "if I was going to travel again, it would be to either China or Africa. You go to either of them two places and you can tell right away what the difference is between you and them. You go to these other places and the only way you can tell is if they say something. And then you can't always tell because about half of them know the English language. That's where we make out mistake," he said, "-- letting all them people onto English. There'd be a heap less trouble if everybody only knew his own language. My wife said knowing two languages was like having eyes in the back of your head. You couldn't put nothing over on her."  "You sho couldn't," the boy muttered, and then he added, "She was  fine. She was sho fine. I never known a finer white woman than her."  Mr. Shortley turned in the opposite direction and worked silently for a while. After a few minutes he leaned up and tapped the colored boy on the shoulder with the handle of his shovel. For a second he only looked at him while a great deal of meaning gathered in his wet eyes. Then he said softly, "Revenge is mine, saith the Lord."  Mrs. McIntyre found that everybody in town knew Mr. Shortley's version of her business and that everyone was critical of her conduct. She began to understand that she had a moral obligation to fire the Pole and that she was shirking it because she found it hard to do. She could not stand the increasing guilt any longer and on a cold Saturday morning, she started off after breakfast to fire him. She walked down to the machine shed where she heard him cranking up the tractor.  There was a heavy frost on the ground that made the fields look like the rough backs of sheep; the sun was almost silver and the woods stuck up like dry bristles on the sky line. The countryside seemed to be receding from the little circle of noise around the shed. Mr. Guizac was squatting on the ground beside the small tractor, putting in a part. Mrs. McIntyre hoped to get the fields turned over while he still had thirty days to work for her. The colored boy was standing by with some tools in his  hand and Mr. Shortley was under the shed about to get up on the large tractor and back it out. She meant to wait until he and the Negro got out of the way before she began her unpleasant duty.  She stood watching Mr. Guizac, stamping her teet on the hard ground, for the cold was climbing like a paralysis up her feet and legs. She had on a heavy black coat and a red head-kerchief with her black hat pulled down on top of it to keep the glare out of her eyes. Under the black brim her face had an abstracted look and once or twice her lips moved silently. Mr. Guizac shouted over the noise of the tractor for the Negro to hand him a screwdriver and when he got it, he turned over on his back on the icy ground and reached up under the machine. She could not see his face, only his feet and legs and trunk sticking impudently out from the side of the tractor. He had on rubber boots that were cracked and splashed with mud He raised one knee and then lowered it and turned himself slightly. Of all the things she resented about him, she resented most that he hadn't left of his own accord.  Mr. Shortley had got on the large tractor and was backing it out from under the shed. He seemed to be warmed by it as if its heat and strength sent impulses up through him that he obeyed instantly. He had headed it toward the small tractor but he braked it on a slight incline and jumped  off and turned back toward the shed. Mrs. McIntyre was looking fixedly at Mr. Guizac's legs lying flat on the ground now. She heard the brake on the large tractor slip and, looking up, she saw it move forward, calculating its own path. Later she remembered that she had seen the Negro jump silently out of the way as if a spring in the earth had released him and that she had seen Mr. Shortley turn his head with incredible slowness and stare silently over his shoulder and that she had started to shout to the Displaced Person but that she had not. She had felt her eyes and Mr. Shortley's eyes and the Negro's eyes come together in one look that froze them in collusion forever, and she had heard the little noise the Pole made as the tractor wheel broke his backbone. The two men ran forward to help and she fainted.  She remembered, when she came to, running somewhere, perhaps into the house and out again but she could not remember what for or if she had fainted again when she got there. When she finally came back to where the tractors were, the ambulance had arrived. Mr. Guizac's body was covered with the bent bodies of his wife and two children and by a black one which hung over him, murmuring words she didn't understand. At first she thought this must be the doctor but then with a feeling of annoyance she recognized the priest, who had come with the ambulance  and was slipping something into the crushed man's mouth. After a minute he stood up and she looked first at his bloody pants legs and then at his face which was not averted from her but was as withdrawn and expressionless as the rest of the countryside. She only stared at him for she was too shocked by her experience to be quite herself. Her mind was not taking hold of all that was happening. She felt she was in some foreign country where the people bent over the body were natives, and she watched like a stranger while the dead man was carried away in the ambulance.  That evening Mr. Shortley left without notice to look for a new position and the Negro, Sulk, was taken with a sudden desire to see more of the world and set off for the southern part of the state. The old man Astor could not work without company. Mrs. McIntyre hardly noticed that she had no help left for she came down with a nervous affliction and had to go to the hospital. When she came back, she saw that the place would be too much for her to run now and she turned her cows over to a professional auctioneer (who sold them at a loss) and retired to live on what she had, while she tried to save her declining health. A numbness developed in one of her legs and her hands and head began to jiggle and eventually she had to stay in bed all the time with only a colored woman  to wait on her. Her eyesight grew steadily worse and she lost her voice altogether. Not many people remembered to come out to the country to see her except the old priest. He came regularly once a week with a bag of breadcrumbs and, after he had fed these to the peacock, he would come in and sit by the side of her bed and explain the doctrines of the Church. 
THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE - What song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women, although puzzling questions are not beyond all conjecture. · SIR THOMAS BROWNE, Urn-Burial. THE mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves, but little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their effects. We know of them, among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles. He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talents into play. He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension preternatural. His results, brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition. The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyze. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The attention is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed, resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. To be less abstract —Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherche movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometimes indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation. Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all these more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived. These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding. To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and, so far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible. Thus to have a retentive memory, and to proceed by “the book,” are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing. But it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced. He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation. The necessary knowledge is that of what to observe. Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game. He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or chagrin. From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit. He recognizes what is played through feint, by the air with which it is thrown upon the table. A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation —all afford, to his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true state of affairs. The first two or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own. The analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis. The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous. It will found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic. The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced. Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18__, I there became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin. This young gentleman was of an excellent —indeed of an illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes. By courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this, he managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life, without troubling himself about its superfluities. Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained. Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion. We saw each other again and again. I was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere self is the theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast extent of his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination. Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I frankly confided to him. It was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion, long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain. Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we should have been regarded as madmen —although, perhaps, as madmen of a harmless nature. Our seclusion was perfect. We admitted no visitors. Indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin had ceased to know or be known in Paris. We existed within ourselves alone. It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to be enamored of the Night for her own sake; and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon. The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the massy shutters of our old building; lighted a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams —reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness. Then we sallied forth into the streets, arm and arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford. At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise —if not exactly in its display —and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation. Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin —the creative and the resolvent. Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased intelligence. But of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea. We were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once Dupin broke forth with these words:“He is a very little fellow, that’s true, and would do better for the Theatre des Varietes.” “There can be no doubt of that,” I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound. “Dupin,” said I, gravely, “this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How was it possible you should know I was thinking of __?” Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought. · “of Chantilly,” said he, “why do you pause? You were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.” This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections. Chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the role of Xerxes, in Crebillon’s tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains. “Tell me, for Heaven’s sake,” I exclaimed, “the method —if method there is —by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.” In fact I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express. “It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes et id genus omne.” “The fruiterer! —you astonish me —I know no fruiterer whomsoever.” “The man who ran up against you as we entered the street —it may have been fifteen minutes ago.” I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the Rue C__ into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what this had to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand. There was not a particle of charlatanerie about Dupin. “I will explain,” he said, “and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question. The larger links of the chain run thus Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.” There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued: “We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue C__. This was the last subject we discussed. As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity. “You kept your eyes upon the ground —glancing, with a petulant expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word ‘stereotomy,’ a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement. I knew that you could not say to yourself ‘stereotomy’ without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps. But in that bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday’s ‘Musee,’ the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler’s change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed. I mean the line Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum. I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the ideas of Orion and Chantilly. That you did combine them I say by the character of the smile which passed over your lips. You thought of the poor cobbler’s immolation. So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little fellow —that Chantilly —he would do better at the Theatre des Varietes.” Not long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of the “Gazette des Tribunaux,” when the following paragraphs arrested our attention. “Extraordinary Murders. —This morning, about three o’clock, the inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of one Madame L’Espanaye, and her daughter, Mademoiselle Camille L’Espanaye. After some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors entered, accompanied by two gendarmes. By this time the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs, two or more rough voices, in angry contention, were distinguished, and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house. As the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased, and everything remained perfectly quiet. The party spread themselves, and hurried from room to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key inside, was forced open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment. “The apartment was in the wildest disorder —the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were found four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three smaller of metal d’Alger, and two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold. The drawers of a bureau, which stood in one corner, were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under the bed (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still in the door. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence. “Of Madame L’Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance. The body was quite warm. Upon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon the face were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been throttled to death. “After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without farther discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell off. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated —the former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity. “To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest clew.” The next day’s paper had these additional particulars. “The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue. Many individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair,” [The word ‘affaire’ has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it conveys with us] “but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it. We give below all the material testimony elicited. “Pauline Dubourg, laundress, deposes that she has known both the deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period. The old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms —very affectionate towards each other. They were excellent pay. Could not speak in regard to their mode or means of living. Believed that Madame L. told fortunes for a living. Was reputed to have money put by. Never met any persons in the house when she called for the clothes or took them home. Was sure that they had no servant in employ. There appeared to be no furniture in any part of the building except in the fourth story. “Pierre Moreau, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame L’Espanaye for nearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided there. The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found, for more than six years. It was formerly occupied by a jeweller, who under-let the upper rooms to various persons. The house was the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let any portion. The old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six years. The two lived an exceedingly retired life —were reputed to have money. Had heard it said among the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes —did not believe it. Had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or ten times. “Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect. No one was spoken of as frequenting the house. It was not known whether there were any living connexions of Madame L. and her daughter. The shutters of the front windows were seldom opened. Those in the rear were always closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story. The house was a good house very old. “Isidore Muset, gendarme, deposes that he was called to the house about three o’clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced it open, at length, with a bayonet —not with a crowbar. Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate, and bolted neither at bottom nor top. The shrieks were continued until the gate was forced —and then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams of some person (or persons) in great agony —were loud and drawn out, not short and quick. Witness led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the first landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention —the one a gruff voice, the other much shriller —a very strange voice. Could distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman. Was positive that it was not a woman’s voice. Could distinguish the words ‘sacre’ and ‘diable.’ The shrill voice was that of a foreigner. Could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman. Could not make out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish. The state of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday. “Henri Duval, a neighbor, and by trade a silversmith, deposes that he was one of the party who first entered the house. Corroborates the testimony of Muset in general. As soon as they forced an entrance, they reclosed the door, to keep out the crowd, which collected very fast, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The shrill voice, the witness thinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain it was not French. Could not be sure that it was a man’s voice. It might have been a woman’s. Was not acquainted with the Italian language. Could not distinguish the words, but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian. Knew Madame L. and her daughter. Had conversed with both frequently. Was sure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased. “—Odenheimer, restaurateur. This witness volunteered his testimony. Not speaking French, was examined through an interpreter. Is a native of Amsterdam. Was passing the house at the time of the shrieks. They lasted for several minutes —probably ten. They were long and loud —very awful and distressing. Was one of those who entered the building. Corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one. Was sure that the shrill voice was that of a man —of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish the words uttered. They were loud and quick —unequal —spoken apparently in fear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh —not so much shrill as harsh. Could not call it a shrill voice. The gruff voice said repeatedly ‘sacre,’ ‘diable’ and once ‘mon Dieu.’ “Jules Mignaud, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue Deloraine. Is the elder Mignaud. Madame L’Espanaye had some property. Had opened an account with his baking house in the spring of the year —(eight years previously). Made frequent deposits in small sums. Had checked for nothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in person the sum of 4000 francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk sent home with the money. “Adolphe Le Bon, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in question, about noon, he accompanied Madame L’Espanaye to her residence with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags. Upon the door being opened, Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while the old lady relieved him of the other. He then bowed and departed. Did not see any person in the street at the time. It is a bye-street —very lonely. William Bird, tailor, deposes that he was one of the party who entered the house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two years. Was one of the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could make out several words, but cannot now remember all. Heard distinctly ‘sacre’ and ‘mon Dieu.’ There was a sound at the moment as if of several persons struggling —a scraping and scuffling sound. The shrill voice was very loud — louder than the gruff one. Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman. Appeared to be that of a German. Might have been a woman’s voice. Does not understand German. “Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when the party reached it. Every thing was perfectly silent —no groans or noises of any kind. Upon forcing the door no person was seen. The windows, both of the back and front room, were down and firmly fastened from within. A door between the two rooms was closed, but not locked. The door leading from the front room into the passage was locked, with the key on the inside. A small room in the front of the house, on the fourth story, at the head of the passage, was open, the door being ajar. This room was crowded with old beds, boxes, and so forth. These were carefully removed and searched. There was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched. Sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys. The house was a four story one, with garrets (mansardes). A trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely —did not appear to have been opened for years. The time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of the room door, was variously stated by the witnesses. Some made it as short as three minutes —some as long as five. The door was opened with difficulty. “Alfonzo Garcio, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue Morgue. Is a native of Spain. Was one of the party who entered the house. Did not proceed up stairs. Is nervous, and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish what was said. The shrill voice was that of an Englishman —is sure of this. Does not understand the English language, but judges by the intonation. “Alberto Montani, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Distinguished several words. The speaker appeared to be expostulating. Could not make out the words of the shrill voice. Spoke quick and unevenly. Thinks it the voice of a Russian. Corroborates the general testimony. Is an Italian. Never conversed with a native of Russia. “Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being. By ‘sweeps’ were meant cylindrical sweeping-brushes, such as are employed by those who clean chimneys. These brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house. There is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs. The body of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength. “Paul Dumas, physician, deposes that he was called to view the bodies about day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated. The fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances. The throat was greatly chafed. There were several deep scratches just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers. The face was fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls protruded. The tongue had been partially bitten through. A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle L’Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown. The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated. All the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered. The left tibia much splintered, as well as all the ribs of the left side. Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron —a chair —any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man. No woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon. The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body, and was also greatly shattered. The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument —probably with a razor. “Alexandre Etienne, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the bodies. Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas. “Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other persons were examined. A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its particulars, was never before committed in Paris —if indeed a murder has been committed at all. The police are entirely at fault —an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature. There is not, however, the shadow of a clew apparent.” The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement continued in the Quartier St. Roch —that the premises in question had been carefully researched, and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose. A postscript, however mentioned that Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned although nothing appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed. Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair —at least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments. It was only after the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders. I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble mystery. I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer. “We must not judge of the means,” said Dupin, “by this shell of an examination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for acumen, are cunning, but no more. There is no method in their proceedings, beyond the method of the moment. They make a vast parade of measures; but, not unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain’s calling for his robe-de-chambre —pour mieux entendre la musique. The results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by simple diligence and activity. When these qualities are unavailing, their schemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering man. But, without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations. He impaired his vision by holding the object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too profound. Truth is not always in a well. In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial. The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found. The modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies. To look at a star by glances —to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly —is to have the best appreciation of its lustre —a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it. A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there is the more refined capacity for comprehension. By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct. “As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them. An inquiry will afford us amusement,” (I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said nothing) “and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I am not ungrateful. We will go and see the premises with our own eyes. I know G__, the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission.” The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue. This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was late in the afternoon when we reached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel in the window, indicating a loge de concierge. Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building —Dupin, meanwhile, examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see no possible object. Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang, and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge. We went up stairs —into the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist. I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the “Gazette des Tribunaux.” Dupin scrutinized every thing —not excepting the bodies of the victims. We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a gendarme accompanying us throughout. The examination occupied us until dark, when we took our departure. On our way home my companion stopped in for a moment at the office of one of the dally papers. I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that Je les menageais: —for this phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder, until about noon the next day. He then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity. There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word “peculiar,” which caused me to shudder, without knowing why. “No, nothing peculiar,” I said; “nothing more, at least, than we both saw stated in the paper.” “The ‘Gazette,’” he replied, “has not entered, I fear, into the unusual horror of the thing. But dismiss the idle opinions of this print. It appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution —I mean for the outre character of its features. The police are confounded by the seeming absence of motive —not for the murder itself —but for the atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations with those just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen, of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true. In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked ‘what has occurred,’ as ‘what has occurred that has never occurred before.’ In fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police.” I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment. “I am now awaiting,” continued he, looking toward the door of our apartment —“I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration. Of the worst portion of the crimes committed, it is probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the entire riddle. I look for the man here —in this room — every moment. It is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will. Should he come, it will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols; and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use.” I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy. I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance. His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall. “That the voices heard in contention,” he said, “by the party upon the stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by the evidence. This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter, and afterward have committed suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of Madame L’Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter’s corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed by some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention. Let me now advert —not to the whole testimony respecting these voices —but to what was peculiar in that testimony. Did you observe anything peculiar about it?” I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice. “That was the evidence itself,” said Dupin, “but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing distinctive. Yet there was something to be observed. The witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. But in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is not that they disagreed —but that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner. Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen. Each likens it —not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant —but the converse. The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and ‘might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the Spanish.’ The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that ‘not understanding French this witness was examined through an interpreter.’ The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and ‘does not understand German.’ The Spaniard ‘is sure’ that it was that of an Englishman, but ‘judges by the intonation’ altogether, ‘as he has no knowledge of the English.’ The Italian believes it the voice of a Russian, but ‘has never conversed with a native of Russia.’ A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, not being cognizant of that tongue, is, like the Spaniard, ‘convinced by the intonation.’ Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as this could have been elicited! —in whose tones, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar! You will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic —of an African. Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points. The voice is termed by one witness ‘harsh rather than shrill.’ It is represented by two others to have been ‘quick and unequal’ No words no sounds resembling words were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable. “I know not,” continued Dupin, “what impression I may have made, so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony —the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices —are in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery. I said ‘legitimate deductions;’ but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result. What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form —a certain tendency —to my inquiries in the chamber. “Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall we first seek here? The means of egress employed by the murderers. It is not too much to say that neither of us believe in praeternatural events. Madame and Mademoiselle L’Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. Then how? Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode must lead us to a definite decision. · Let us examine, each by each, the possible means of egress. It is clear that the assassins were in the room where Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was found, or at least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every direction. No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance. But, not trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own. There were, then, no secret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys. These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street. The murderers must have passed, then, through those of the back room. Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these apparent ‘impossibilities’ are, in reality, not such. “There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it. The former was found securely fastened from within. It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. And, therefore, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows. “My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the reason I have just given —because here it was, I knew, that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality. “I proceeded to think thus —a posteriori. The murderers did escape from one of these windows. This being so, they could not have re-fastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened; —the consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter. Yet the sashes were fastened. They must, then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no escape from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty, and attempted to raise the sash. It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated. A concealed spring must, I now knew, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises, at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forebore to upraise the sash. “I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing out through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught —but the nail could not have been replaced. The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations. The assassins must have escaped through the other window. Supposing, then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there must be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the headboard minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor. I now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner —driven in nearly up to the head. “You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once ‘at fault.’ The scent had never for an instant been lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the secret to its ultimate result, —and that result was the nail. It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this point, terminated the clew. ‘There must be something wrong,’ I said, ‘about the nail.’ I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole, where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete —the fissure was invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed. I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect. “The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed) it had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail, —farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary. “The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod. From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades —a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux. They are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door) except that the upper half is latticed or worked in open trellis —thus affording an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half open —that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination. It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected. —By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trelliswork. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might have swung himself into the room. “I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat. It is my design to show you, first, that the thing might possibly have been accomplished: —but, secondly and chiefly, I wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary —the almost praeternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it. “You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that ‘to make out my case’ I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter. This may be the practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason. My ultimate object is only the truth. My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxta-position that very unusual activity of which I have just spoken, with that very peculiar shrill (or harsh) and unequal voice, about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected.” At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of Dupin flitted over my mind. I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension, without power to comprehend —as men, at times, find themselves upon the brink of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. My friend went on with his discourse. “You will see,” he said, “that I have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress. It was my design to suggest that both were effected in the same manner, at the same point. Let us now revert to the interior of the room. Let us survey the appearances here. The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many articles of apparel still remained within them. The conclusion here is absurd. It is a mere guess —a very silly one —and no more. How are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained? Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life —saw no company —seldom went out —had little use for numerous changes of habiliment. Those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies. If a thief had taken any, why did he not take the best —why did he not take all? In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen? The gold was abandoned. Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was discovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you, therefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive, engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice. Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities —that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration. In the present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence. It would have been corroborative of this idea of motive. But, under the real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together. “Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your attention —that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this —let us glance at the butchery itself. Here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward. Ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this. Least of all, do they thus dispose of the murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will that there was something excessively outre —something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men. Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down! “Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous. On the hearth were thick tresses —very thick tresses —of grey human hair. These had been torn out by the roots. You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well as myself. Their roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp —sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body of Madame L’Espanaye I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed. This idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them —because, by the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows have ever been opened at all. If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification. What result, then, has ensued? What impression have I made upon your fancy?” I felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question. “A madman,” I said, “has done this deed —some raving maniac, escaped from a neighboring Maison de Sante.” “In some respects,” he replied, “your idea is not irrelevant. But the voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs. Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always the coherence of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman is not such as I now hold in my hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of Madame L’Espanaye. Tell me what you can make of it.” “Dupin!” I said, completely unnerved; “this hair is most unusual —this is no human hair.” “I have not asserted that it is,” said he; “but, before we decide this point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon this paper. It is a facsimile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as ‘dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails,’ upon the throat of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and in another, (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,) as a ‘series of livid spots, evidently the impression of fingers.’ “You will perceive,” continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon the table before us, “that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold. There is no slipping apparent. Each finger has retained —possibly until the death of the victim —the fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself. Attempt, now, to place all your fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see them.” I made the attempt in vain. “We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,” he said. “The paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is cylindrical. Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which is about that of the throat. Wrap the drawing around it, and try the experiment again.” I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before. “This,” I said, “is the mark of no human hand.” “Read now,” replied Dupin, “this passage from Cuvier.” It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all. I understood the full horrors of the murder at once. “The description of the digits,” said I, as I made an end of reading, “is in exact accordance with this drawing, I see that no animal but an Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them. This tuft of tawny hair, too, is identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery. Besides, there were two voices heard in contention, and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a Frenchman.” True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice, —the expression, ‘mon Dieu!’ This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder. It is possible —indeed it is far more than probable — that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him. He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it. It is still at large. I will not pursue these guesses —for I have no right to call them more —since the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another. We will call them guesses then, and speak of them as such. If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement, which I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of ‘Le Monde,’ (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors,) will bring him to our residence.” He handed me a paper, and I read thus: Caught —In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the —inst., (the morning of the murder,) a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species. The owner, (who is ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel,) may have the animal again, upon identifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping. Call at No.__, Rue __, Faubourg St. Germain —au troisieme. “How was it possible,” I asked, “that you should know the man to be a sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?” “I do not know it,” said Dupin. “I am not sure of it. Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod. It could not have belonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement —about demanding the Ourang-Outang. He will reason thus: —’I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value —to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself —why should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my grasp. It was found in the Bois de Boulogne —at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed? The police are at fault —they have failed to procure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance. Above all, I am known. The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast. I am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the animal at least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer the advertisement, get the OurangOutang, and keep it close until this matter has blown over. At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs. “Be ready,” said Dupin, “with your pistols, but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself.” The front door of the house had been left open, and the visitor had entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase. Now, however, he seemed to hesitate. Presently we heard him descending. Dupin was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up. He did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision and rapped at the door of our chamber. “Come in,” said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone. A man entered. He was a sailor, evidently, —a tall, stout, and muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of countenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburnt, was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio. He had with him a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed. He bowed awkwardly, and bade us “good evening,” in French accents, which, although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian origin. Sit down, my friend,” said Dupin. “I suppose you have called about the OurangOutang. Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him; a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal. How old do you suppose him to be?” The sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone: “I have no way of telling —but he can’t be more than four or five years old. Have you got him here?” “Oh no; we had no conveniences for keeping him here. He is at a livery stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by. You can get him in the morning. Of course you are prepared to identify the property?” “To be sure I am, sir.” “I shall be sorry to part with him,” said Dupin. “I don’t mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir,” said the man. “Couldn’t expect it. Am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animal —that is to say, any thing in reason.” “Well,” replied my friend, “that is all very fair, to be sure. Let me think! —what should I have? Oh! I will tell you. My reward shall be this. You shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the Rue Morgue.” Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just as quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it, and put the key in his pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table. The sailor’s face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation. He started to his feet and grasped his cudgel; but the next moment he fell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance of death itself. He spoke not a word. I pitied him from the bottom of my heart. “My friend,” said Dupin, in a kind tone, “you are alarming yourself unnecessarily —you are indeed. We mean you no harm whatever. I pledge you the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no injury. I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the Rue Morgue. It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know that I have had means of information about this matter —means of which you could never have dreamed. Now the thing stands thus. You have done nothing which you could have avoided —nothing, certainly, which renders you culpable. You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have robbed with impunity. You have nothing to conceal. You have no reason for concealment. On the other hand, you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know. An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator.” The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while Dupin uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all gone. “So help me God,” said he, after a brief pause, “I will tell you all I know about this affair; —but I do not expect you to believe one half I say —I would be a fool indeed if I did. Still, I am innocent, and I will make a clean breast if I die for it.” What he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage to the Indian Archipelago. A party, of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure. Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang-Outang. This companion dying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession. After great trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on board ship. His ultimate design was to sell it. Returning home from some sailors’ frolic on the night, or rather in the morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined. Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street. The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it. It then again made off. In this manner the chase continued for a long time. The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o’clock in the morning. In passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive’s attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L’Espanaye’s chamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it perceived the lightning-rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed. The whole feat did not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open again by the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room. The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning-rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room. It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived. The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind. As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame L’Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned. The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body. The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired. Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just discernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear. Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the window headlong. As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home —dreading the consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman’s exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute. I have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have escaped from the chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of the door. It must have closed the window as it passed through it. It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the Jardin des Plantes. Le Bon was instantly released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some comments from Dupin) at the bureau of the Prefect of Police. This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the propriety of every person minding his own business. “Let them talk,” said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply. “Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience. I am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle. Nevertheless, that he failed in the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound. In his wisdom is no stamen. It is all head and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna, —or, at best, all head and shoulders, like a codfish. But he is a good creature after all. I like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity. I mean the way he has ‘de nier ce qui est, et d’expliquer ce qui n’est pas.’” 1 1 Rousseau, Nouvelle Heloise.
True!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses—not destroyed—not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily—how calmly I can tell you the whole story.  It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture—a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees—very gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.  Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded—with what caution—with what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the hinges creaked)—I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights—every night just at midnight—but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.  Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers—of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back—but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out—”Who’s there?” I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening;—just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.  Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief—oh, no!—it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself—”It is nothing but the wind in the chimney—it is only a mouse crossing the floor,” or “It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.” Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel—although he neither saw nor heard—to feel the presence of my head within the room.  When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little—a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it—you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily—until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye. It was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man’s face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot. And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense?—now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.  But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man’s terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!—do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The old man’s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once—once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.  If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all—ha! ha! When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o’clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart,—for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. I smiled,—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search—search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.  The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:—It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness—until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale;—but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased—and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound—much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men—but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder—louder—louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!—no, no! They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery of my horror!—this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now—again!—hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!  “Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the deed!—tear up the planks! here, here!—It is the beating of his hideous heart!”
She was one of those pretty and charming girls born, as if by an error of fate, into a family of clerks. She had no dowry, no expectations, no means of becoming known, understood, loved or wedded by a man of wealth and distinction; and so she let herself be married to a minor official at the Ministry of Education.       She dressed plainly because she had never been able to afford anything better, but she was as unhappy as if she had once been wealthy. Women don't belong to a caste or class; their beauty, grace, and natural charm take the place of birth and family. Natural delicacy, instinctive elegance and a quick wit determine their place in society, and make the daughters of commoners the equals of the very finest ladies.       She suffered endlessly, feeling she was entitled to all the delicacies and luxuries of life. She suffered because of the poorness of her house as she looked at the dirty walls, the worn-out chairs and the ugly curtains. All these things that another woman of her class would not even have noticed, tormented her and made her resentful. The sight of the little Brenton girl who did her housework filled her with terrible regrets and hopeless fantasies. She dreamed of silent antechambers hung with Oriental tapestries, lit from above by torches in bronze holders, while two tall footmen in knee-length breeches napped in huge armchairs, sleepy from the stove's oppressive warmth. She dreamed of vast living rooms furnished in rare old silks, elegant furniture loaded with priceless ornaments, and inviting smaller rooms, perfumed, made for afternoon chats with close friends - famous, sought after men, who all women envy and desire.       When she sat down to dinner at a round table covered with a three-day-old cloth opposite her husband who, lifting the lid off the soup, shouted excitedly, "Ah! Beef stew! What could be better," she dreamed of fine dinners, of shining silverware, of tapestries which peopled the walls with figures from another time and strange birds in fairy forests; she dreamed of delicious dishes served on wonderful plates, of whispered gallantries listened to with an inscrutable smile as one ate the pink flesh of a trout or the wings of a quail.      She had no dresses, no jewels, nothing; and these were the only things she loved. She felt she was made for them alone. She wanted so much to charm, to be envied, to be desired and sought after.       She had a rich friend, a former schoolmate at the convent, whom she no longer wanted to visit because she suffered so much when she came home. For whole days afterwards she would weep with sorrow, regret, despair and misery.  One evening her husband came home with an air of triumph, holding a large envelope in his hand.       "Look," he said, "here's something for you."       She tore open the paper and drew out a card, on which was printed the words:       "The Minister of Education and Mme. Georges Rampouneau request the pleasure of M. and Mme. Loisel's company at the Ministry, on the evening of Monday January 18th."       Instead of being delighted, as her husband had hoped, she threw the invitation on the table resentfully, and muttered:       "What do you want me to do with that?"       "But, my dear, I thought you would be pleased. You never go out, and it will be such a lovely occasion! I had awful trouble getting it. Every one wants to go; it is very exclusive, and they're not giving many invitations to clerks. The whole ministry will be there."       She stared at him angrily, and said, impatiently:       "And what do you expect me to wear if I go?"       He hadn't thought of that. He stammered:       "Why, the dress you go to the theatre in. It seems very nice to me ..."       He stopped, stunned, distressed to see his wife crying. Two large tears ran slowly from the corners of her eyes towards the corners of her mouth. He stuttered:       "What's the matter? What's the matter?"       With great effort she overcame her grief and replied in a calm voice, as she wiped her wet cheeks:       "Nothing. Only I have no dress and so I can't go to this party. Give your invitation to a friend whose wife has better clothes than I do."       He was distraught, but tried again:       "Let's see, Mathilde. How much would a suitable dress cost, one which you could use again on other occasions, something very simple?"       She thought for a moment, computing the cost, and also wondering what amount she could ask for without an immediate refusal and an alarmed exclamation from the thrifty clerk.       At last she answered hesitantly:       "I don't know exactly, but I think I could do it with four hundred francs."       He turned a little pale, because he had been saving that exact amount to buy a gun and treat himself to a hunting trip the following summer, in the country near Nanterre, with a few friends who went lark-shooting there on Sundays.       However, he said:       "Very well, I can give you four hundred francs. But try and get a really beautiful dress."  The day of the party drew near, and Madame Loisel seemed sad, restless, anxious. Her dress was ready, however. One evening her husband said to her:       "What's the matter? You've been acting strange these last three days."       She replied: "I'm upset that I have no jewels, not a single stone to wear. I will look cheap. I would almost rather not go to the party."       "You could wear flowers, " he said, "They are very fashionable at this time of year. For ten francs you could get two or three magnificent roses."       She was not convinced.    "No; there is nothing more humiliating than looking poor in the middle of a lot of rich women."       "How stupid you are!" her husband cried. "Go and see your friend Madame Forestier and ask her to lend you some jewels. You know her well enough for that."       She uttered a cry of joy.       "Of course. I had not thought of that."       The next day she went to her friend's house and told her of her distress.       Madame Forestier went to her mirrored wardrobe, took out a large box, brought it back, opened it, and said to Madame Loisel:       "Choose, my dear."       First she saw some bracelets, then a pearl necklace, then a gold Venetian cross set with precious stones, of exquisite craftsmanship. She tried on the jewelry in the mirror, hesitated, could not bear to part with them, to give them back. She kept asking:       "You have nothing else?"       "Why, yes. But I don't know what you like."       Suddenly she discovered, in a black satin box, a superb diamond necklace, and her heart began to beat with uncontrolled desire. Her hands trembled as she took it. She fastened it around her neck, over her high-necked dress, and stood lost in ecstasy as she looked at herself.       Then she asked anxiously, hesitating:       "Would you lend me this, just this?"       "Why, yes, of course."       She threw her arms around her friend's neck, embraced her rapturously, then fled with her treasure.  The day of the party arrived. Madame Loisel was a success. She was prettier than all the other women, elegant, gracious, smiling, and full of joy. All the men stared at her, asked her name, tried to be introduced. All the cabinet officials wanted to waltz with her. The minister noticed her.   She danced wildly, with passion, drunk on pleasure, forgetting everything in the triumph of her beauty, in the glory of her success, in a sort of cloud of happiness, made up of all this respect, all this admiration, all these awakened desires, of that sense of triumph that is so sweet to a woman's heart.       She left at about four o'clock in the morning. Her husband had been dozing since midnight in a little deserted anteroom with three other gentlemen whose wives were having a good time.       He threw over her shoulders the clothes he had brought for her to go outside in, the modest clothes of an ordinary life, whose poverty contrasted sharply with the elegance of the ball dress. She felt this and wanted to run away, so she wouldn't be noticed by the other women who were wrapping themselves in expensive furs.       Loisel held her back.       "Wait a moment, you'll catch a cold outside. I'll go and find a cab."       But she would not listen to him, and ran down the stairs. When they were finally in the street, they could not find a cab, and began to look for one, shouting at the cabmen they saw passing in the distance.       They walked down toward the Seine in despair, shivering with cold. At last they found on the quay one of those old night cabs that one sees in Paris only after dark, as if they were ashamed to show their shabbiness during the day.       They were dropped off at their door in the Rue des Martyrs, and sadly walked up the steps to their apartment. It was all over, for her. And he was remembering that he had to be back at his office at ten o'clock.       In front of the mirror, she took off the clothes around her shoulders, taking a final look at herself in all her glory. But suddenly she uttered a cry. She no longer had the necklace round her neck!      "What is the matter?" asked her husband, already half undressed.       She turned towards him, panic-stricken.       "I have ... I have ... I no longer have Madame Forestier's necklace."       He stood up, distraught.       "What! ... how! ... That's impossible!"       They looked in the folds of her dress, in the folds of her cloak, in her pockets, everywhere. But they could not find it.       "Are you sure you still had it on when you left the ball?" he asked.       "Yes. I touched it in the hall at the Ministry."       "But if you had lost it in the street we would have heard it fall. It must be in the cab."       "Yes. That's probably it. Did you take his number?"       "No. And you, didn't you notice it?"       "No."       They stared at each other, stunned. At last Loisel put his clothes on again.       "I'm going back," he said, "over the whole route we walked, see if I can find it."       He left. She remained in her ball dress all evening, without the strength to go to bed, sitting on a chair, with no fire, her mind blank.       Her husband returned at about seven o'clock. He had found nothing.       He went to the police, to the newspapers to offer a reward, to the cab companies, everywhere the tiniest glimmer of hope led him.       She waited all day, in the same state of blank despair from before this frightful disaster.       Loisel returned in the evening, a hollow, pale figure; he had found nothing.       "You must write to your friend," he said, "tell her you have broken the clasp of her necklace and that you are having it mended. It will give us time to look some more."     She wrote as he dictated.  At the end of one week they had lost all hope.       And Loisel, who had aged five years, declared:       "We must consider how to replace the jewel."       The next day they took the box which had held it, and went to the jeweler whose name they found inside. He consulted his books.       "It was not I, madame, who sold the necklace; I must simply have supplied the case."       And so they went from jeweler to jeweler, looking for an necklace like the other one, consulting their memories, both sick with grief and anguish.       In a shop at the Palais Royal, they found a string of diamonds which seemed to be exactly what they were looking for. It was worth forty thousand francs. They could have it for thirty-six thousand.       So they begged the jeweler not to sell it for three days. And they made an arrangement that he would take it back for thirty-four thousand francs if the other necklace was found before the end of February.       Loisel had eighteen thousand francs which his father had left him. He would borrow the rest.       And he did borrow, asking for a thousand francs from one man, five hundred from another, five louis here, three louis there. He gave notes, made ruinous agreements, dealt with usurers, with every type of money-lender. He compromised the rest of his life, risked signing notes without knowing if he could ever honor them, and, terrified by the anguish still to come, by the black misery about to fall on him, by the prospect of every physical privation and every moral torture he was about to suffer, he went to get the new necklace, and laid down on the jeweler's counter thirty-six thousand francs.       When Madame Loisel took the necklace back, Madame Forestier said coldly:       "You should have returned it sooner, I might have needed it."       To the relief of her friend, she did not open the case. If she had detected the substitution, what would she have thought? What would she have said? Would she have taken her friend for a thief?  From then on, Madame Loisel knew the horrible life of the very poor. But she played her part heroically. The dreadful debt must be paid. She would pay it. They dismissed their maid; they changed their lodgings; they rented a garret under the roof.       She came to know the drudgery of housework, the odious labors of the kitchen. She washed the dishes, staining her rosy nails on greasy pots and the bottoms of pans. She washed the dirty linen, the shirts and the dishcloths, which she hung to dry on a line; she carried the garbage down to the street every morning, and carried up the water, stopping at each landing to catch her breath. And, dressed like a commoner, she went to the fruiterer's, the grocer's, the butcher's, her basket on her arm, bargaining, insulted, fighting over every miserable sou.       Each month they had to pay some notes, renew others, get more time.       Her husband worked every evening, doing accounts for a tradesman, and often, late into the night, he sat copying a manuscript at five sous a page.       And this life lasted ten years.       At the end of ten years they had paid off everything, everything, at usurer's rates and with the accumulations of compound interest.       Madame Loisel looked old now. She had become strong, hard and rough like all women of impoverished households. With hair half combed, with skirts awry, and reddened hands, she talked loudly as she washed the floor with great swishes of water. But sometimes, when her husband was at the office, she sat down near the window and thought of that evening at the ball so long ago, when she had been so beautiful and so admired.       What would have happened if she had not lost that necklace? Who knows, who knows? How strange life is, how fickle! How little is needed for one to be ruined or saved!  One Sunday, as she was walking in the Champs Élysées to refresh herself after the week's work, suddenly she saw a woman walking with a child. It was Madame Forestier, still young, still beautiful, still charming.      Madame Loisel felt emotional. Should she speak to her? Yes, of course. And now that she had paid, she would tell her all. Why not?       She went up to her.       "Good morning, Jeanne."       The other, astonished to be addressed so familiarly by this common woman, did not recognize her. She stammered:       "But - madame - I don't know. You must have made a mistake."       "No, I am Mathilde Loisel."       Her friend uttered a cry.       "Oh! ... my poor Mathilde, how you've changed! ..."       "Yes, I have had some hard times since I last saw you, and many miseries ... and all because of you! ..."       "Me? How can that be?"       "You remember that diamond necklace that you lent me to wear to the Ministry party?"       "Yes. Well?"       "Well, I lost it."       "What do you mean? You brought it back."       "I brought you back another exactly like it. And it has taken us ten years to pay for it. It wasn't easy for us, we had very little. But at last it is over, and I am very glad."       Madame Forestier was stunned.       "You say that you bought a diamond necklace to replace mine?"       "Yes; you didn't notice then? They were very similar."       And she smiled with proud and innocent pleasure.       Madame Forestier, deeply moved, took both her hands.     "Oh, my poor Mathilde! Mine was an imitation! It was worth five hundred francs at most! ..."
Fifteen years had passed since I was at Virelogne. I returned there in the autumn to shoot with my friend Serval, who had at last rebuilt his chateau, which the Prussians had destroyed.  I loved that district. It is one of those delightful spots which have a sensuous charm for the eyes. You love it with a physical love. We, whom the country enchants, keep tender memories of certain springs, certain woods, certain pools, certain hills seen very often which have stirred us like joyful events. Sometimes our thoughts turn back to a corner in a forest, or the end of a bank, or an orchard filled with flowers, seen but a single time on some bright day, yet remaining in our hearts like the image of certain women met in the street on a spring morning in their light, gauzy dresses, leaving in soul and body an unsatisfied desire which is not to be forgotten, a feeling that you have just passed by happiness.  At Virelogne I loved the whole countryside, dotted with little woods and crossed by brooks which sparkled in the sun and looked like veins carrying blood to the earth. You fished in them for crawfish, trout and eels. Divine happiness! You could bathe in places and you often found snipe among the high grass which grew along the borders of these small water courses.  I was stepping along light as a goat, watching my two dogs running ahead of me, Serval, a hundred metres to my right, was beating a field of lucerne. I turned round by the thicket which forms the boundary of the wood of Sandres and I saw a cottage in ruins.  Suddenly I remembered it as I had seen it the last time, in 1869, neat, covered with vines, with chickens before the door. What is sadder than a dead house, with its skeleton standing bare and sinister?  I also recalled that inside its doors, after a very tiring day, the good woman had given me a glass of wine to drink and that Serval had told me the history of its people. The father, an old poacher, had been killed by the gendarmes. The son, whom I had once seen, was a tall, dry fellow who also passed for a fierce slayer of game. People called them "Les Sauvage."  Was that a name or a nickname?  I called to Serval. He came up with his long strides like a crane.  I asked him:  "What's become of those people?"  This was his story:  When war was declared the son Sauvage, who was then thirty-three years old, enlisted, leaving his mother alone in the house. People did not pity the old woman very much because she had money; they knew it.  She remained entirely alone in that isolated dwelling, so far from the village, on the edge of the wood. She was not afraid, however, being of the same strain as the men folk--a hardy old woman, tall and thin, who seldom laughed and with whom one never jested. The women of the fields laugh but little in any case, that is men's business. But they themselves have sad and narrowed hearts, leading a melancholy, gloomy life. The peasants imbibe a little noisy merriment at the tavern, but their helpmates always have grave, stern countenances. The muscles of their faces have never learned the motions of laughter.     Mother Sauvage continued her ordinary existence in her cottage, which was soon covered by the snows. She came to the village once a week to get bread and a little meat. Then she returned to her house. As there was talk of wolves, she went out with a gun upon her shoulder--her son's gun, rusty and with the butt worn by the rubbing of the hand--and she was a strange sight, the tall "Sauvage," a little bent, going with slow strides over the snow, the muzzle of the piece extending beyond the black headdress, which confined her head and imprisoned her white hair, which no one had ever seen.  One day a Prussian force arrived. It was billeted upon the inhabitants, according to the property and resources of each. Four were allotted to the old woman, who was known to be rich.  They were four great fellows with fair complexion, blond beards and blue eyes, who had not grown thin in spite of the fatigue which they had endured already and who also, though in a conquered country, had remained kind and gentle. Alone with this aged woman, they showed themselves full of consideration, sparing her, as much as they could, all expense and fatigue. They could be seen, all four of them, making their toilet at the well in their shirt-sleeves in the gray dawn, splashing with great swishes of water their pink-white northern skin, while La Mere Sauvage went and came, preparing their soup. They would be seen cleaning the kitchen, rubbing the tiles, splitting wood, peeling potatoes, doing up all the housework like four good sons around their mother.     But the old woman thought always of her own son, so tall and thin, with his hooked nose and his brown eyes and his heavy mustache which made a roll of black hair upon his lip. She asked every day of each of the soldiers who were installed beside her hearth: "Do you know where the French marching regiment, No. 23, was sent? My boy is in it."  They invariably answered, "No, we don't know, don't know a thing at all." And, understanding her pain and her uneasiness--they who had mothers, too, there at home--they rendered her a thousand little services. She loved them well, moreover, her four enemies, since the peasantry have no patriotic hatred; that belongs to the upper class alone. The humble, those who pay the most because they are poor and because every new burden crushes them down; those who are killed in masses, who make the true cannon's prey because they are so many; those, in fine, who suffer most cruelly the atrocious miseries of war because they are the feeblest and offer least resistance--they hardly understand at all those bellicose ardors, that excitable sense of honor or those pretended political combinations which in six months exhaust two nations, the conqueror with the conquered.  They said in the district, in speaking of the Germans of La Mere Sauvage:  "There are four who have found a soft place."  Now, one morning, when the old woman was alone in the house, she observed, far off on the plain, a man coming toward her dwelling. Soon she recognized him; it was the postman to distribute the letters. He gave her a folded paper and she drew out of her case the spectacles which she used for sewing. Then she read:  MADAME SAUVAGE: This letter is to tell you sad news. Your boy Victor was killed yesterday by a shell which almost cut him in two. I was near by, as we stood next each other in the company, and he told me about you and asked me to let you know on the same day if anything happened to him. I took his watch, which was in his pocket, to bring it back to you when the war is done.  CESAIRE RIVOT,  Soldier of the 2d class, March. Reg. No. 23.  The letter was dated three weeks back.  She did not cry at all. She remained motionless, so overcome and stupefied that she did not even suffer as yet. She thought: "There's Victor killed now." Then little by little the tears came to her eyes and the sorrow filled her heart. Her thoughts came, one by one, dreadful, torturing. She would never kiss him again, her child, her big boy, never again! The gendarmes had killed the father, the Prussians had killed the son. He had been cut in two by a cannon-ball. She seemed to see the thing, the horrible thing: the head falling, the eyes open, while he chewed the corner of his big mustache as he always did in moments of anger.  What had they done with his body afterward? If they had only let her have her boy back as they had brought back her husband--with the bullet in the middle of the forehead!     But she heard a noise of voices. It was the Prussians returning from the village. She hid her letter very quickly in her pocket, and she received them quietly, with her ordinary face, having had time to wipe her eyes.  They were laughing, all four, delighted, for they brought with them a fine rabbit--stolen, doubtless--and they made signs to the old woman that there was to be something good to east.  She set herself to work at once to prepare breakfast, but when it came to killing the rabbit, her heart failed her. And yet it was not the first. One of the soldiers struck it down with a blow of his fist behind the ears.  The beast once dead, she skinned the red body, but the sight of the blood which she was touching, and which covered her hands, and which she felt cooling and coagulating, made her tremble from head to foot, and she kept seeing her big boy cut in two, bloody, like this still palpitating animal.  She sat down at table with the Prussians, but she could not eat, not even a mouthful. They devoured the rabbit without bothering themselves about her. She looked at them sideways, without speaking, her face so impassive that they perceived nothing.  All of a sudden she said: "I don't even know your names, and here's a whole month that we've been together." They understood, not without difficulty, what she wanted, and told their names.  That was not sufficient; she had them written for her on a paper, with the addresses of their families, and, resting her spectacles on her great nose, she contemplated that strange handwriting, then folded the sheet and put it in her pocket, on top of the letter which told her of the death of her son.  When the meal was ended she said to the men:  "I am going to work for you."  And she began to carry up hay into the loft where they slept.  They were astonished at her taking all this trouble; she explained to them that thus they would not be so cold; and they helped her. They heaped the stacks of hay as high as the straw roof, and in that manner they made a sort of great chamber with four walls of fodder, warm and perfumed, where they should sleep splendidly.     At dinner one of them was worried to see that La Mere Sauvage still ate nothing. She told him that she had pains in her stomach. Then she kindled a good fire to warm herself, and the four Germans ascended to their lodging-place by the ladder which served them every night for this purpose.  As soon as they closed the trapdoor the old woman removed the ladder, then opened the outside door noiselessly and went back to look for more bundles of straw, with which she filled her kitchen. She went barefoot in the snow, so softly that no sound was heard. From time to time she listened to the sonorous and unequal snoring of the four soldiers who were fast asleep.  When she judged her preparations to be sufficient, she threw one of the bundles into the fireplace, and when it was alight she scattered it over all the others. Then she went outside again and looked.  In a few seconds the whole interior of the cottage was illumined with a brilliant light and became a frightful brasier, a gigantic fiery furnace, whose glare streamed out of the narrow window and threw a glittering beam upon the snow.  Then a great cry issued from the top of the house; it was a clamor of men shouting heartrending calls of anguish and of terror. Finally the trapdoor having given way, a whirlwind of fire shot up into the loft, pierced the straw roof, rose to the sky like the immense flame of a torch, and all the cottage flared.  Nothing more was heard therein but the crackling of the fire, the cracking of the walls, the falling of the rafters. Suddenly the roof fell in and the burning carcass of the dwelling hurled a great plume of sparks into the air, amid a cloud of smoke.  The country, all white, lit up by the fire, shone like a cloth of silver tinted with red.  A bell, far off, began to toll.  The old "Sauvage" stood before her ruined dwelling, armed with her gun, her son's gun, for fear one of those men might escape.  When she saw that it was ended, she threw her weapon into the brasier. A loud report followed.  People were coming, the peasants, the Prussians.  They found the woman seated on the trunk of a tree, calm and satisfied.  A German officer, but speaking French like a son of France, demanded:  "Where are your soldiers?"  She reached her bony arm toward the red heap of fire which was almost out and answered with a strong voice:  "There!"  They crowded round her. The Prussian asked:  "How did it take fire?"  "It was I who set it on fire."  They did not believe her, they thought that the sudden disaster had made her crazy. While all pressed round and listened, she told the story from beginning to end, from the arrival of the letter to the last shriek of the men who were burned with her house, and never omitted a detail.  When she had finished, she drew two pieces of paper from her pocket, and, in order to distinguish them by the last gleams of the fire, she again adjusted her spectacles. Then she said, showing one:     "That, that is the death of Victor." Showing the other, she added, indicating the red ruins with a bend of the head: "Here are their names, so that you can write home." She quietly held a sheet of paper out to the officer, who held her by the shoulders, and she continued:  "You must write how it happened, and you must say to their mothers that it was I who did that, Victoire Simon, la Sauvage! Do not forget."  The officer shouted some orders in German. They seized her, they threw her against the walls of her house, still hot. Then twelve men drew quickly up before her, at twenty paces. She did not move. She had understood; she waited.  An order rang out, followed instantly by a long report. A belated shot went off by itself, after the others.  The old woman did not fall. She sank as though they had cut off her legs.  The Prussian officer approached. She was almost cut in two, and in her withered hand she held her letter bathed with blood.  My friend Serval added:  "It was by way of reprisal that the Germans destroyed the chateau of the district, which belonged to me."  I thought of the mothers of those four fine fellows burned in that house and of the horrible heroism of that other mother shot against the wall.  And I picked up a little stone, still blackened by the flames.
WITHOUT in any way wishing to blow my own trumpet, I think that I can claim to being in most respects a moderately well-matured and rounded individual. I have travelled a good deal. I am adequately read. I speak Greek and Latin. I dabble in science. I can tolerate a mildly liberal attitude in the politics of others. I have compiled a volume of notes upon the evolution of the madrigal in the fifteenth century. I have witnessed the death of a large number of persons in their beds; and in addition, I have influenced, at least I hope I have, the lives of quite a few others by the spoken word delivered from the pulpit. Yet in spite of all this, I must confess that I have never in my life--well, how shall I put it?--I have never really had anything much to do with women. To be perfectly honest, up until three weeks ago I had never so much as laid a finger on one of them except perhaps to help her over a stile or something like that when the occasion demanded. And even then I always tried to ensure that I touched only the shoulder or the waist or some other place where the skin was covered, because the one thing I never could stand was actual contact between my skin and theirs. Skin touching skin, my skin, that is, touching the skin of a female, whether it were leg, neck, face, hand, or merely finger, was so repugnant to me that I invariably greeted a lady with my hands clasped firmly behind my back to avoid the inevitable handshake. I could go further than that and say that any sort of physical contact with them, even when the skin wasn't bare, would disturb me considerably. If a woman stood close to me in a queue so that our bodies touched, or if she squeezed in beside me on a bus seat, hip to hip and thigh to thigh, my cheeks would begin burning like mad and little prickles of sweat would start coming out all over the crown of my head. This condition is all very well in a schoolboy who has just reached the age of puberty. With him it is simply Dame Nature's way of putting on the brakes and holding the lad back until he is old enough to behave himself like a gentleman. I approve of that. But there was no reason on God's earth why I, at the ripe old age of thirtyone, should continue to suffer a similar embarrassment. I was well trained to resist temptation, and I was certainly not given to vulgar passions. Had I been even the slightest bit ashamed of my own personal appearance, then that mightXXXX Possibly have explained the whole thing. But I was not. On the contrary, and though I say it myself, the fates had been rather kind to me in that regard. I stood exactly five and a half feet tall in my stockinged feet, and my shoulders, though they sloped downward a little from the neck, were nicely in balance with my small neat frame. (Personally, I've always thought that a little slope on the shoulder lends a subtle and faintly aesthetic air to a man who is not overly tall, don't you agree?) My features were regular, my teeth were in excellent condition (protruding only a smallish amount from the upper jaw), and my hair, which was an unusually brilliant ginger-red, grew thickly all over my scalp. Good heavens above, I had seen men who were perfect shrimps in comparison with me displaying an astonishing aplomb in their dealings with the fairer sex. And oh, how I envied them! How I longed to do likewise--to be able to share in a few of those pleasant little rituals of contact that I observed continually taking place between men and women--the touching of hands, the peck on the cheek, the linking of arms, the pressure of knee against knee or foot against foot under the diningtable, and most of all, the full-blown violent embrace that comes when two of them join together on the floor--for a dance. But such things were not for me. Alas, I had to spend my time avoiding them instead. And this, my friends, was easier said than done, even for a humble curate in a small country region far from the fleshpots of the metropolis. My flock, you understand, contained an inordinate number of ladies. There were scores of them in the parish and the unfortunate thing about it was that at least sixty per cent of them were spinsters, completely untamed by the benevolent influence of holy matrimony. I tell you I was jumpy as a squirrel. One would have thought that with all the careful training my mother had given me as a child, I should have been capable of taking this sort of thing well in my stride; and no doubt I would have done if only she had lived long enough to complete my education. But alas, she was killed when I was still quite young. She was a wonderful woman, my mother. She used to wear huge bracelets on her wrists, five or six of them at a time, with all sorts of things hanging from them and tinkling against each other as she moved. It didn't matter where she was, you could always find her by listening for the noise of those bracelets. It was better than a cowbell. And in the evenings she used to sit on the sofa in her black trousers with her feet tucked up underneath her, smoking endless cigarettes from a long black holder. And I'd be crouching on the floor, watching her. "You want to taste my martini, George?" she used to ask. "Now stop it, Glare," my father would say. "If you're not careful you'll stunt the boy's growth." "Go on," she said. "Don't be frightened of it. Drink it." I always did everything my mother told me. "That's enough," my father said. "He only has to know what it tastes like." "Please don't interfere, Boris. This is very important." My mother had a theory that nothing in the world should be kept secret from a child. Show him everything. Make him experience it. "I'm not going to have any boy of mine going around whispering dirty secrets with other children and having to guess about this thing and that simply because no one will tell him." Tell him everything. Make him listen. "Come over here, George, and I'll tell you what there is to know about God." She never read stories to me at night before I went to bed; she just "told' me things instead. And every evening it was something different. "Come over here, George, because now I'm going to tell you about Mohammed." She would be sitting on the sofa in her black trousers with her legs crossed and her feet tucked up underneath her, and she'd beckon to me in a queer languorous manner with the hand that held the long black cigarette-holder, and the bangles would start jingling all the way up her arm. "If you must have a religion I suppose Mohammedanism is as good as any of them. It's all based on keeping healthy. You have lots of wives, and you mustn't ever smoke or drink." "Why mustn't you smoke or drink, Mummy?" "Because if you've got lots of wives you have to keep healthy and virile." "What is virile?" "I'll go into that tomorrow, my pet. Let's deal with one subject at a time. Another thing about the Mohammedan is that he never never gets constipated." "Now, Clare," my father would say, looking up from his book. "Stick to the facts." "My dear Boris, you don't know anything about it. Now if only you would try bending forward and touching the ground with your forehead morning, noon, and night every day, facing Mecca, you might have a bit less trouble in that direction yourself" I used to love listening to her, even though I could only understand about half of what she was saying. She really was telling me secrets, and there wasn't anything more exciting than that. "Come over here, George, and I'll tell you precisely how your father makes his money." "Now, Glare, that's quite enough." "Nonsense, darling. Why make a secret out of it with the child? He'll only imagine something much much worse." I was exactly ten years old when she started giving me detailed lectures on the subject of sex. This was the biggest secret of them all, and therefore the most enthralling. "Come over here, George, because now I'm going to tell you how you came into this world, right from the very beginning." I saw my father glance up quietly, and open his mouth wide the way he did when he was going to say something vital, but my mother was already fixing him with those brilliant shining eyes of hers, and he went slowly back to his book without uttering a sound. "Your poor father is embarrassed," she said, and she gave me her private smile, the one that she gave nobody else, only to me--the one-sided smile where just one corner of her mouth lifted slowly upward until it made a lovely long wrinkle that stretched right up to the eye itself, and became a sort of wink-smile instead. "Embarrassment, my pet, is the one thing that I want you never to feel. And don't think for a moment that your father is embarrassed only because of you." My father started wriggling about in his chair. "My God, he's even embarrassed about things like that when he's alone with me, his own wife." "About things like what?" I asked. At that point my father got up and quietly left the room. I think it must have been about a week after this that my mother was killed. It may possibly have been a little later, ten days or a fortnight, I can't be sure. All I know is that we were getting near the end of this particular series of "talks' when it happened; and because I myself was personally involved in the brief chain of events that led up to her death, I can still remember every single detail of that curious night just as clearly as if it were yesterday. I can switch it on in my memory any time I like and run it through in front of my eyes exactly as though it were the reel of a cinema film; and it never varies. It always ends at precisely the same place, no more and no less, and it always begins in the same peculiarly sudden way, with the screen in darkness, and my mother's voice somewhere above me, calling my name: "George! Wake up, George, wake up!" And then there is a bright electric light dazzling in my eyes, and right from the very centre of it, but far away, the voice is still calling me: "George, wake up and get out of bed and put your dressing-gown on! Quickly! You're coming downstairs. There's something I want you to see. Come on, child, come on! Hurry up! And put your slippers on. We're going outside." "Outside?" "Don't argue with me, George. Just do as you're told." I am so sleepy I can hardly see to walk, but my mother takes me firmly by the hand and leads me downstairs and out through the front door into the night where the cold air is like a sponge of water in my face, and I open my eyes wide and see the lawn all sparkling with frost and the cedar tree with its tremendous arms standing black against a thin small moon. And overhead a great mass of stars is wheeling up into the sky. We hurry across the lawn, my mother and I, her bracelets all jingling like mad and me having to trot to keep up with her. Each step I take I can feel the crisp frosty grass crunching softly underfoot. "Josephine has just started having her babies," my mother says. "It's a perfect opportunity. You shall watch the whole process." There is a light burning in the garage when we get there, and we go inside. My father isn't there, nor is the car, and the place seems huge and bare, and the concrete floor is freezing cold through the soles of my bedroom slippers. Josephine is reclining on a heap of straw inside the low wire cage in one corner of the room large blue rabbit with small pink eyes that watch us suspiciously as we go towards her. XXXX The husband, whose name is Napoleon, is now in a separate cage in the opposite corner, and I notice that he is standing up on his hind legs scratching impatiently at the netting. "Look!" my mother cries. "She's having the first one! It's almost out!" We both creep closer to Josephine, and I squat down beside the cage with my face right up against the wire. I am fascinated. Here is one rabbit coming out of another. It is magical and rather splendid. It is also very quick. "Look how it comes out all neatly wrapped up in its own little cellophane bag!" my mother is saying. "And just look how she's taking care of it now! The poor darling doesn't have a face-flannel, and even if she did she couldn't hold it in her paws, so she's washing it with her tongue instead." The mother rabbit rolls her small pink eyes anxiously in our direction, and then I see her shifting position in the straw so that her body is between us and the young one. "Come round the other side," my mother says. "The silly thing has moved. I do believe she's trying to hide her baby from us." We go round the other side of the cage. The rabbit follows us with her eyes. A couple of yards away the buck is prancing madly up and down, clawing at the wire. "Why is Napoleon so excited?" I ask. "I don't know, dear. Don't you bother about him. Watch Josephine. I expect she'll be having another one soon. Look how carefully she's washing that little baby! She's treating it just like a human mother treats hers! Isn't it funny to think that I did almost exactly the same sort of thing to you once?" The big blue doe is still watching us, and now, again, she pushes the baby away with her nose and rolls slowly over to face the other way. Then she goes on with her licking and cleaning. "Isn't it wonderful how a mother knows instinctively just what she has to do?" my mother says. "Now you just imagine, my pet, that the baby is you, and Josephine is me--wait a minute, come back over here again so you can get a better look." We creep back around the cage to keep the baby in view. "See how she's fondling it and kissing it all over! There! She's really kissing it now, isn't she! Exactly like me and you!" I peer closer. It seems a queer way of kissing to me. "Look!" I scream. "She's eating it!" And sure enough, the head of the baby rabbit is now disappearing swiftly into the mother's mouth. "Mummy! Quick!" But almost before the sound of my scream has died away, the whole of that tiny pink body has vanished down the mother's throat. I swing quickly around, and the next thing I know I'm looking straight into my own mother's face, not six inches above me, and no doubt she is trying to say something or it may be that she is too astonished to say anything, but all I see is the mouth, the huge red mouth opening wider and wider until it is just a great big round gaping hole with a black centre, and I scream again, and this time I can't stop. Then suddenly out come her hands, and I can feel her skin touching mine, the long cold fingers closing tightly over my fists, and I jump back and jerk myself free and rush blindly out into the night. I run down the drive and through the front gates, screaming all the way, and then, above the noise of my own voice I can hear the jingle of bracelets coming up behind me in the dark, getting louder and louder as she keeps gaining on me all the way down the long hill to the bottom of the lane and over the bridge on to the main road where the cars are streaming by at sixty miles an hour with headlights blazing. Then somewhere behind me I hear a screech of tyres skidding on the road surface, and then there is silence, and I notice suddenly that the bracelets aren't jingling behind me any more. Poor Mother. If only she could have lived a little longer. I admit that she gave me a nasty fright with those rabbits, but it wasn't her fault, and anyway queer things like that were always happening between her and me. I had come to regard them as a sort of toughening process that did me more good than harm. But if only she could have lived long enough to complete my education, I'm sure I should never have had all that trouble I was telling you about a few minutes ago. I want to get on with that now. I didn't mean to begin talking about my mother. She doesn't have anything to do with what I originally started out to say. I won't mention her again. I was telling you about the spinsters in my parish. It's an ugly word, isn't it--spinster? It conjures up the vision either of a stringy old hen with a puckered mouth or of a huge ribald monster shouting around the house in ridingbreeches. But these were not like that at all. They were a clean, healthy, wellbuilt group of females, the majority of them highly bred and surprisingly wealthy, and I feel sure that the average unmarried man would have been gratified to have them around. In the beginning, when I first came to the vicarage, I didn't have too bad a time. I enjoyed a measure of protection, of course, by reason of my calling and my cloth. In addition, I myself adopted a cool dignified attitude that was calculated to discourage familiarity. For a few months, therefore, I was able to move freely among my parishioners, and no one took the liberty of linking her arm in mine at a charity bazaar, or of touching my fingers with hers as she passed me the cruet at suppertime. I was very happy. I was feeling better than I had in years. Even that little nervous habit I had of flicking my earlobe with my forefinger when I talked began to disappear. This was what I call my first period, and it extended over approximately six months. Then came trouble. I suppose I should have known that a healthy male like myself couldn't hope to evade embroilment indefinitely simply by keeping a fair distance between himself and the ladies. It just doesn't work. If anything it has the opposite effect. I would see them eyeing me covertly across the room at a whist drive, whispering to one another, nodding, running their tongues over their lips, sucking at their cigarettes, plotting the best approach, but always whispering, and sometimes I overheard snatches of their talk--"What a shy person...he's just a trifle nervous, isn't he...he's much too tense... he needs companionship...he wants loosening up... we must teach him how to relax." And then slowly as the weeks went by, they began to stalk me. I knew they were doing it. I could feel it happening although at first they did nothing definite to give themselves away. That was my second period. It lasted for the best part of a year and was very trying indeed. But it was paradise compared with the third and final phase. For now, instead of sniping at me sporadically from far away, the attackers suddenly came charging out of the wood with bayonets fixed. It was terrible, frightening. Nothing is more calculated to unnerve a man than the swift unexpected assault. Yet I am not a coward. I will stand my ground against any single individual of my own size under any circumstances. But this onslaught, I am now convinced, was conducted by vast numbers operating as one skilfully coordinated unit. The first offender was Miss Elphinstone, a large woman with moles. I had dropped in on her during the afternoon to solicit a contribution towards a new set of bellows for the organ, and after some pleasant conversation in the library she had graciously handed me a cheque for two guineas. I told her not to bother to see me to the door and I went out into the hall to get my hat. I was about to reach for it when all at once--she must have come tip-toeing up behind me--all at once I felt a bare arm sliding through mine, and one second later her fingers were entwined in my own, and she was squeezing my hand hard, in out, in out, as though it were the bulb of a throat-spray. "Are you really so Very Reverend as you're always pretending to be?" she whispered. Well! All I can tell you is that when that arm of hers came sliding in under mine, it felt exactly as though a cobra was coiling itself around my wrist. I leaped away, pulled open the front door, and fled down the drive without looking back. The very next day we held a jumble sale in the village hall (again to raise money for the new bellows), and towards the end of it I was standing in a corner quietly drinking a cup of tea and keeping an eye on the villagers crowding round the stalls when all of a sudden I heard a voice beside me saying, "Dear me, what a hungry look you have in those eyes of yours." The next instant a long curvaceous body was leaning up against mine and a hand with red fingernails was trying to push a thick slice of coconut cake into my mouth. "Miss Prattley," I cried. "Please!" But she'd got me up against the wall, and with a teacup in one hand and a saucer in the other I was powerless to resist. I felt the sweat breaking out all over me and if my mouth hadn't quickly become full of the cake she was pushing into it, I honestly believe I would have started to scream. A nasty incident, that one; but there was worse to come. The next day it was Miss Unwin. Now Miss Unwin happened to be a close friend of Miss Elphinstone's and of Miss Prattley's, and this of course should have been enough to make me very cautious. Yet who would have thought that she of all people. Miss Unwin, that quiet gentle little mouse who only a few weeks before had presented me with a new hassock exquisitely worked in needlepoint with her own hands, who would have thought that she would ever have taken a liberty with anyone? So when she asked me to accompany her down to the crypt to show her the Saxon murals, it never entered my head that there was devilry afoot. But there was. I don't propose to describe that encounter; it was too painful. And the ones which followed were no less savage. Nearly every day from then on, some new outrageous incident would take place. I became a nervous wreck. At times I hardly knew what I was doing. I started reading the burial service at young Gladys Pitcher's wedding. I dropped Mrs Harris's new baby into the font during the christening and gave it a nasty ducking. An uncomfortable rash that I hadn't had in over two years reappeared on the side of my neck, and that annoying business with my earlobe came back worse than ever before. Even my hair began coming out in my comb. The faster I retreated, the faster they came after me. Women are like that. Nothing stimulates them quite so much as a display of modesty or shyness in a man. And they become doubly persistent if underneath it all they happen to detect--and here I have a most difficult confession to make--if they happen to detect, as they did in me, a little secret gleam of longing shining in the backs of the eyes. You see, actually I was mad about women. Yes, I know. You will find this hard to believe after all that I have said, but it was perfectly true. You must understand that it was only when they touched me with their fingers or pushed up against me with their bodies that I became alarmed. Providing they remained at a safe distance, I could watch them for hours on end with the same peculiar fascination that you yourself might experience in watching a creature you couldn't bear to touch--an octopus, for example, or a long poisonous snake. I loved the smooth white look of a bare arm emerging from a sleeve, curiously naked like a peeled banana. I could get enormously excited just from watching a girl walk across the room in a tight dress; and I particularly enjoyed the back view of a pair of legs when the feet were in rather high heels-- the wonderful braced-up look behind the knees, with the legs themselves very taut as though they were made of strong elastic stretched out almost to breaking-point, but not quite. Sometimes, in Lady Birdwell's drawingroom, sitting near the window on a summer's afternoon, I would glance over the rim of my teacup towards the swimming pool and become agitated beyond measure by the sight of a little patch of sunburned stomach bulging between the top and bottom of a two-piece bathing-suit. There is nothing wrong in having thoughts like these. All men harbour them from time to time. But they did give me a terrible sense of guilt. Is it me, I kept asking myself, who is unwittingly responsible for the shameless way in which these ladies are now behaving? Is it the gleam in my eye (which I cannot control) that is constantly rousing their passions and egging them on? Am I unconsciously giving them what is sometimes known as the come-hither signal every time I glance their way? Am I? Or is this brutal conduct of theirs inherent in the very nature of the female? I had a pretty fair idea of the answer to this question, but that was not good enough for me. I happen to possess a conscience that can never be consoled by guesswork; it has to have proof. I simply had to find out who was really the guilty party in this case--me or them, and with this object in view, I now decided to perform a simple experiment of my own invention, using Snelling's rats. A year or so previously I had had some trouble with an objectionable choirboy named Billy Snelling. On three consecutive Sundays this youth had brought a pair of white rats into church and had let them loose on the floor during my sermon. In the end I had confiscated the animals and carried them home and placed them in a box in the shed at the bottom of the vicarage garden. Purely for humane reasons I had then proceeded to feed them, and as a result, but without any further encouragement from me, the creatures began to multiply very rapidly. The two became five, and five became twelve. It was at this point that I decided to use them for research purposes. There were exactly equal numbers of males and females, six of each, so that conditions were ideal. I first isolated the sexes, putting them into two separate cages, and I left them like that for three whole weeks. Now a rat is a very lascivious animal, and any zoologist will tell you that for them this is an inordinately long period of separation. At a guess I would say that one week of enforced celibacy for a rat is equal to approximately one year of the same treatment for someone like Miss Elphinstone or Miss Prattley So you can see that I was doing a pretty fair job in reproducing actual conditions. When the three weeks were up, I took a large box that was divided across the centre by a little fence, and I placed the females on one side and the males on the other. The fence consisted of nothing more than three single strands of naked wire, one inch apart, but there was a powerful electric current running through the wires. To add a touch of reality to the proceedings, I gave each female a name. The largest one, who also had the longest whiskers, was Miss Elphinstone. The one with a short thick tail was Miss Prattley. The smallest of them all was Miss Unwin, and so on. The males, all six of them, were ME. I now pulled up a chair and sat back to watch the result. All rats are suspicious by nature, and when I first put the two sexes together in the box with only the wire between them, neither side made a move. The males stared hard at the females through the fence. The females stared back, waiting for the males to come forward. I could see that both sides were tense with yearning. Whiskers quivered and noses twitched and occasionally a long tail would flick sharply against the wall of the box. After a while, the first male detached himself from his group and advanced gingerly towards the fence, his belly close to the ground. He touched a wire and was immediately electrocuted. The remaining eleven rats froze, motionless. There followed a period of nine and a half minutes during which neither side moved; but I noticed that while all the males were now staring at the dead body of their colleague, the females had eyes only for the males. Then suddenly Miss Prattley with the short tail could stand it no longer. She came bounding forward, hit the wire, and dropped dead. The males pressed their bodies closer to the ground and gazed thoughtfully at the two corpses by the fence. The females also seemed to be quite shaken, and there was another wait, with neither side moving. Now it was Miss Unwin who began to show signs of impatience. She snorted audibly and twitched a pink mobile nose-end from side to side, then suddenly she started jerking her body quickly up and down as though she were doing pushups. She glanced round at her remaining four companions, raised her tail high in the air as much as to say, "Here I go, girls," and with that she advanced briskly to the wire, pushed her head through it, and was killed. Sixteen minutes later, Miss Foster made her first move. Miss Foster was a woman in the village who bred cats, and recently she had had the effrontery to put up a large sign outside her house in the High Street, saying FOSTER'S CATFERY. Through long association with the creatures she herself seemed to have acquired all their most noxious characteristics, and whenever she came near me in a room I could detect, even through the smoke of her Russian cigarette, a faint but pungent aroma of cat. She had never struck me as having much control over her baser instincts, and it was with some satisfaction, therefore, that I watched her flow as she foolishly took her own life in a last desperate plunge towards the masculine sex. A Miss Montgomery-Smith came next, a small determined woman who had once tried to make me believe that she had been engaged to a bishop. She died trying to creep on her belly under the lowest wire, and I must say I thought this a very fair reflection upon the way in which she lived her life. And still the five remaining males stayed motionless, waiting. The fifth female to go was Miss Plumley. She was a devious one who was continually slipping little messages addressed to me into the collection bag. Only the Sunday before, I had been in the vestry counting the money after morning service and had come across one of them tucked inside a folded ten-shilling note. Your poor throat sounded hoarse today during the sermon, it said. Let me bring you a bottle of my own cherry pectoral to soothe it down. Most affectionately, Eunice Plumley. Miss Plumley ambled slowly up to the wire, sniffed the centre strand with the tip of her nose, came a fraction too close, and received two hundred and forty volts of alternating current through her body. The five males stayed where they were, watching the slaughter. And now only Miss Elphinstone remained on the feminine side. For a full half-hour neither she nor any of the others made a move. Finally one of the males stirred himself slightly, took a step forward, hesitated, thought better of it, and slowly sank back into a crouch on the floor. This must have frustrated Miss Elphinstone beyond measure, for suddenly, with eyes blazing, she rushed forward and took a flying leap at the wire. It was a spectacular jump and she nearly cleared it; but one of her hind legs grazed the top strand, and thus she also perished with the rest of her sex. I cannot tell you how much good it did me to watch this simple and, though I say it myself, this rather ingenious experiment. In one stroke I had laid open the incredibly lascivious, stopatnothing nature of the female. My own sex was vindicated; my own conscience was cleared. In a trice, all those awkward little flashes of guilt from which I had continually been suffering flew out of the window. I felt suddenly very strong and serene in the knowledge of my own innocence. For a few moments I toyed with the absurd idea of electrifying the black iron railings that ran around the vicarage garden; or perhaps just the gate would be enough. Then I would sit back comfortably in a chair in the library and watch through the window as the real Misses Elphinstone and Prattley and Unwin came forward one after the other and paid the final penalty for pestering an innocent male. Such foolish thoughts! What I must actually do now, I told myself, was to weave around me a sort of invisible electric fence constructed entirely out of my Own personal moral fibre. Behind this I would sit in perfect safety while the enemy, one after another, flung themselves against the wire. I would begin by cultivating a brusque manner. I would speak crisply to all women, and refrain from smiling at them. I would no longer step back a pace when one of them advanced upon me. I would stand my ground and glare at her, and if she said something that I considered suggestive, I would make a sharp retort. It was in this mood that I set off the very next day to attend Lady Birdwell's tennis party. I was not a player myself, but her ladyship had graciously invited me to drop in and mingle with the guests when play was over at six o'clock. I believe she thought that it lent a certain tone to a gathering to have a clergyman present, and she was probably hoping to persuade me to repeat the performance I gave the last time I was there, when I sat at the piano for a full hour and a quarter after supper and entertained the guests with a detailed description of the evolution of the madrigal through the centuries. I arrived at the gates on my cycle promptly at six o'clock and pedalled up the long drive towards the house. This was the first week of June, and the rhododendrons were massed in great banks of pink and purple all the way along on either side. I was feeling unusually blithe and dauntless. The previous day's experiment with rats had made it impossible now for anyone to take me by surprise. I knew exactly what to expect and I was armed accordingly. All around me the little fence was up. "Ah, good evening, Vicar," Lady Birdwell cried, advancing upon me with both arms outstretched. I stood my ground and looked her straight in the eye. "How's Birdwell?" I said. "Still up in the city?" I doubt whether she had ever before in her life heard Lord Birdwell referred to thus by someone who had never even met him. It stopped her dead in her tracks. She looked at me queerly and didn't seem to know how to answer. "I'll take a seat if I may," I said, and walked past her towards the terrace where a group of nine or ten guests were settled comfortably in cane chairs, sipping their drinks. They were mostly women, the usual crowd, all of them dressed in white tennis clothes, and as I strode in among them my own sober black suiting seemed to give me, I thought, just the right amount of separateness for the occasion. The ladies greeted me with smiles. I nodded to them and sat down in a vacant chair, but I didn't smile back. "I think perhaps I'd better finish my story another time," Miss Elphinstone was saying. "I don't believe the vicar would approve." She giggled and gave me an arch look. I knew she was waiting for me to come out with my usual little nervous laugh and to say my usual little sentence about how broadminded I was; but I did nothing of the sort. I simply raised one side of my upper lip until it shaped itself into a tiny curl of contempt (I had practised in the minor that morning), and then I said sharply, in a loud voice, "Mens sana in corpore sano." "What's that?" she cried. "Come again, Vicar." "A clean mind in a healthy body," I answered. "It's a family motto." There was an odd kind of silence for quite a long time after this. I could see the women exchanging glances with one another, frowning, shaking their heads. "The vicar's in the dumps," Miss Foster announced. She was the one who bred cats. "I think the vicar needs a drink." "Thank you," I said, "but I never imbibe. You know that." "Then do let me fetch you a nice cooling glass of fruit cup?" This last sentence came softly and rather suddenly from someone just behind me, to my right, and there was a note of such genuine concern in the speaker's voice that I turned round. I saw a lady of singular beauty whom I had met only once before, about a month ago. Her name was Miss Roach, and I remembered that she had struck me then as being a person far out of the usual run. I had been particularly impressed by her gentle and reticent nature; and the fact that I had felt comfortable in her presence proved beyond doubt that she was not the sort of person who would try to impinge herself upon me in any way. "I'm sure you must be tired after cycling all that distance," she was saying now. I swivelled right round in my chair and looked at her carefully. She was certainly a striking person--unusually muscular for a woman, with broad shoulders and powerful arms and a huge calf bulging on each leg. The flush of the afternoon's exertions was still upon her, and her face glowed with a healthy red sheen. "Thank you so much, Miss Roach," I said, "but I never touch alcohol in any form. Maybe a small glass of lemon squash." "The fruit cup is only made of fruit, Padre." How I loved a person who called me "Padre'. The word has a military ring about it that conjures up visions of stern discipline and officer rank. "Fruit cup?" Miss Elphinstone said. "It's harmless." "My dear man, it's nothing but vitamin C," Miss Foster said. "Much better for you than fizzy lemonade," Lady Birdwell said. "Carbon dioxide attacks the lining of the stomach." "I'll get you some," Miss Roach said, smiling at me pleasantly. It was a good open smile, and there wasn't a trace of guile or mischief from one corner of the mouth to the other. She stood up and walked over to the drink table. I saw her slicing an orange, then an apple, then a cucumber, then a grape, and dropping the pieces into a glass. Then she poured in a large quantity of liquid from a bottle whose label I couldn't quite read without my spectacles, but I fancied that I saw the name JIM on it, or TIM or PIM, or some such word. "I hope there's enough left," Lady Birdwell called out. "Those greedy children of mine do love it so." "Plenty," Miss Roach answered, and she brought the drink to me and set it on the table. Even without tasting it I could easily understand why children adored it. The liquid itself was dark amber-red and there were great hunks of fruit floating around among the ice cubes; and on top of it all, Miss Roach had placed a sprig of mint. I guessed that the mint had been put there specially for me, to take some of the sweetness away and to lend a touch of grown-upness to a concoction that was otherwise so obviously for youngsters. "Too sticky for you, Padre!" "It's delectable," I said, sipping it. "Quite perfect." It seemed a pity to gulp it down quickly after all the trouble Miss Roach had taken to make it, but it was so refreshing I couldn't resist. "Do let me make you another!" I liked the way she waited until I had set the glass on the table, instead of trying to take it out of my hand. "I wouldn't eat the mint if I were you," Miss Elphinstone said. "I'd better get another bottle from the house," Lady Birdwell called out. "You're going to need it, Mildred." "Do that," Miss Roach replied. "I drink gallons of the stuff myself," she went on, speaking to me. "And I don't think you'd say that I'm exactly what you might call emaciated." "No indeed," I answered fervently. I was watching her again as she mixed me another brew, noticing how the muscles rippled under the skin of the arm that raised the bottle. Her neck also was uncommonly fine when seen from behind; not thin and stringy like the necks of a lot of these so-called modern beauties, but thick and strong with a slight ridge running down either side where the sinews bulged. It wasn't easy to guess the age of a person like this, but I doubted whether she could have been more than fortyeight or nine. I had just finished my second big glass of fruit cup when I began to experience a most peculiar sensation. I seemed to be floating up out of my chair, and hundreds of little warm waves came washing in under me, lifting me higher and higher. I felt as buoyant as a bubble, and everything around me seemed to be bobbing up and down and swirling gently from side to side. It was all very pleasant, and I was overcome by an almost irresistible desire to break into song. "Feeling happy?" Miss Roach's voice sounded miles and miles away, and when I turned to look at her, I was astonished to see how near she really was. She, also, was bobbing up and down. "Terrific," I answered. "I'm feeling absolutely terrific." Her face was large and pink, and it was so close to me now that I could see the pale carpet of fuzz covering both her cheeks, and the way the sunlight caught each tiny separate hair and made it shine like gold. All of a sudden I found myself wanting to put out a hand and stroke those cheeks of hers with my fingers. To tell the truth I wouldn't have objected in the least if she had tried to do the same to me. "Listen," she said softly. "How about the two of us taking a little stroll down the garden to see the lupins?" "Fine," I answered. "Lovely. Anything you say." There is a small Georgian summer-house alongside the croquet lawn in Lady Birdwell's garden, and the very next thing I knew, I was sitting inside it on a kind of chaise-longue and Miss Roach was beside me. I was still bobbing up and down, and so was she, and so, for that matter, was the summer-house, but I was feeling wonderful. I asked Miss Roach if she would like me to give her a song. "Not now," she said, encircling me with her arms and squeezing my chest against hers so hard that it hurt. "Don't," I said, melting. "That's better," she kept saying. "That's much better, isn't it?" Had Miss Roach or any other female tried to do this sort of thing to me an hour before, I don't quite know what would have happened. I think I would probably have fainted. I might even have died. But here I was now, the same old me, actually relishing the contact of those enormous bare arms against my body! Also-- and this was the most amazing thing of all--I was beginning to feel the urge to reciprocate. I took the lobe of her left ear between my thumb and forefinger, and tugged it playfully. "Naughty boy," she said. I tugged harder and squeezed it a bit at the same time. This roused her to such a pitch that she began to grunt and snort like a hog. Her breathing became loud and stertorous. "Kiss me," she ordered. "What?" I said. "Come on, kiss me." At that moment, I saw her mouth. I saw this great mouth of hers coming slowly down on top of me, starting to open, and coming closer and closer, and opening wider and wider; and suddenly my whole stomach began to roll right over inside me and I went stiff with terror. "No!" I shrieked. "Don't! Don't, Mummy, don't!" I can only tell you that I had never in all my life seen anything more terrifying than that mouth. I simply could not stand it coming at me like that. Had it been a red-hot iron someone was pushing into my face I wouldn't have been nearly so petrified, I swear I wouldn't. The strong arms were around me, pinning me down so that I couldn't move, and the mouth kept getting larger and larger, and then all at once it was right on top of me, huge and wet and cavernous, and the next second--I was inside it. I was right inside this enormous mouth, lying on my stomach along the length of the tongue, with my feet somewhere around the back of the throat; and I knew instinctively that unless I got myself out again at once I was going to be swallowed alive--just like that baby rabbit. I Could feel my legs being drawn down the throat by some kind of suction, and quickly I threw up "fly arms and grabbed hold of the lower front teeth and held on for dear life. My head was near the mouth-entrance, and I could actually look right out between the lips and see a little patch of the world outside--sunlight shining on the polished wooden floor of the summer-house, and on the floor itself a gigantic foot in a white tennis shoe. I had a good grip with my fingers on the edge of the teeth, and in spite of the suction, I was managing to haul myself up slowly towards the daylight when suddenly the upper teeth came down on my knuckles and started chopping away at them so fiercely I had to let go. I went sliding back down the throat, feet first, clutching madly at this and that as I went, but everything was so smooth and slippery I couldn't get a grip. I glimpsed a bright flash of gold on the left as I slid past the last of the molars, and then three inches farther on I saw what must have been the uvula above me, dangling like a thick red stalactite from the roof of the throat. I grabbed at it with both hands but the thing slithered through my fingers and I went on down. I remember screaming for help, but I could hardly hear the sound of my own voice above the noise of the wind that was caused by the throat-owner's breathing. There seemed to be a gale blowing all the time, a queer erratic gale that blew alternately very cold (as the air came in) and very hot (as it went out again). I managed to get my elbows hooked over a sharp fleshy ridge--I presume the epiglottis--and for a brief moment I hung there, defying the suction and scrabbling with my feet to find a foothold on the wall of the larynx; but the throat gave a huge swallow that jerked me away, and down I went again. From then on, there was nothing else for me to catch hold of, and down and down I went until soon my legs were dangling below me in the upper reaches of the stomach, and I could feel the slow powerful pulsing of peristalsis dragging away at my ankles, pulling me down and down and down. Far above me, outside in the open air, I could hear the distant babble of women's voices: "It's not true... "But my dear Mildred, how awful "The man must be mad." "Your poor mouth, just look at it." "A sex maniac..." "A sadist...Someone ought to write to the bishop." And then Miss Roach's voice, louder than the others, swearing and screeching like a parakeet: "He's damn lucky I didn't kill him, the little bastard!...I said to him, listen, I said, if ever I happen to want any of my teeth extracted, I'll go to the dentist, not to a goddam vicar...It isn't as though I'd given him any encouragement either!. "Where is he now, Mildred?" "God knows. In the bloody summer-house, I Suppose." "Hey girls, let's go and root him out!" Oh dear, oh dear. Looking back on it now, some three weeks later, I don't know how I ever came through the nightmare of that awful afternoon without taking leave of my senses. A gang of witches like that is a very dangerous thing to fool around with, and had they managed to catch me in the summer-house right then and there when their blood was up, they would as likely as not have torn me limb from limb on the spot. Either that, or I should have been frogmarched down to the police station with Lady Birdwell and Miss Roach leading the procession through the main street of the village. But of course they didn't catch me. They didn't catch me then, and they haven't caught me yet, and if my luck continues to hold, I think I've got a fair chance of evading them altogether or anyway for a few months, until they forget about the whole affair. As you might guess, I am having to keep entirely to myself and to take no part in public affairs or social life. I find that writing is a most salutary occupation at a time like this, and I spend many hours each day playing with sentences. I regard each sentence as a little wheel, and my ambition lately has been to gather several hundred of them together at once and to fit them all end to end, with the cogs interlocking, like gears, but each wheel a different size, each turning at a different speed. Now and again I try to put a really big one right next to a very small one in such a way that the big one, turning slowly, will make the small one spin so fast that it hums. Very tricky, that. I also sing madrigals in the evenings, but I miss my own harpsichord terribly. All the same, this isn't such a bad place, and I have made myself as comfortable as I possibly can. It is a small chamber situated in what is almost certainly the primary section of the duodenal loop, just before it begins to run vertically downward in front of the right kidney. The floor is quite level--indeed it was the first level place I came to during that horrible descent down Miss Roach's throat--and that's the only reason I managed to stop at all. Above me, I can see a pulpy sort of opening that I take to be the pylorus, where the stomach enters the small intestine (I can still remember some of those diagrams my mother used to show me), and below me, there is a funny little hole in the wall where the pancreatic duct enters the lower section of the duodenum. It is all a trifle bizarre for a man of conservative tastes like myself. Personally I prefer oak furniture and parquet flooring. But there is anyway one thing here that pleases me greatly, and that is the walls. They are lovely and soft, like a sort of padding, and the advantage of this is that I can bounce up against them as much as I wish without hurting myself. There are several other people about, which is rather surprising, but thank God they are every one of them males. For some reason or other, they all wear white coats, and they bustle around pretending to be very busy and important. In actual fact, they are an uncommonly ignorant bunch of fellows. They don't even seem to realize where they are. I try to tell them, but they refuse to listen. Sometimes I get so angry and frustrated with them that I lose my temper and start to shout; and then a sly mistrustful look comes over the faces and they begin backing slowly away, and saying, "Now then. Take it easy. Take it easy, vicar, there's a good boy. Take it easy." What sort of talk is that? But there is one oldish man--he comes in to see me every morning after breakfast--who appears to live slightly closer to reality than the others. He is civil and dignified, and I imagine he is lonely because he likes nothing better than to sit quietly in my room and listen to me talk. The only trouble is that whenever we get on to the subject of our whereabouts, he starts telling me that he's going to help me to escape. He said it again this morning, and we had quite an argument about it. "But can't you see," I said patiently, "I don't want to escape." "My dear Vicar, why ever not?" "I keep telling you--because they're all searching for me outside." "Who?" "Miss Elphinstone and Miss Roach and Miss Prattley and all the rest of them." "What nonsense." "Oh yes they are! And I imagine they're after you as well, but you won't admit it." "No, my friend, they are not after me." "Then may I ask precisely what you are doing down here?" A bit of a stumper for him, that one. I could see he didn't know how to answer it. "I'll bet you were fooling around with Miss Roach and got yourself swallowed up just the same as I did. I'll bet that's exactly what happened, only you're ashamed to admit it." He looked suddenly so wan and defeated when I said this that I felt sorry for him. "Would you like me to sing you a song?" I asked. But he got up without answering and went quietly out into the corridor. "Cheer up," I called after him. "Don't be depressed. There is always some balm in Gilead."
It was one of those nights that made him feel he knew what it was like to be a blind man; not the shadow of an image for his eyes to discern, not even the forms of the trees visible against the sky. Out of the darkness he became aware of small rustling noises in the hedge, the breathing of a horse some distance away in the field, the soft thud of a hoof as it moved its foot; and once he heard the rush of a bird flying past him low overhead. "Jock," he said, speaking loud. "We'll go home now." And he turned and began to walk back up the slope of the lane, the dog pulling ahead, showing the way in the dark. It must be nearly midnight, he thought. That meant that soon it would be tomorrow. Tomorrow was worse than today. Tomorrow was the worst of all because it was going to become today--and today was now. Today had not been very nice, especially that business with the splinter. Stop it, he told himself. There isn't any sense thinking about it. It doesn't do anyone any good thinking about things like that. Think about something else for a change. You can kick out a dangerous thought, you know, if you put another in its place. Go right back as far as you can go. Let's have some memories of sweet days. The seaside holidays in the summer, wet sand and red buckets and shrimping nets and the slippery seaweedy rocks and the small clear pools and sea anemones and snails and mussels and sometimes one grey translucent shrimp hovering deep down in the beautiful green water. But how could that splinter have got into the sole of his foot without him feeling it? It is not important. Do you remember hunting for cowries along the margin of the tide, each one so fine and perfect it became a precious jewel to be held in the hand all the way home; and the little orange-coloured scallops, the pearly oyster shells, the tiny bits of emerald glass, a live hermit crab, a cockle, the spine of a skate, and once, but never to be forgotten, the dry seawashed jawbone of a human being with teeth in it, white and wonderful among the shells and pebbles. Oh Mummy, look what I've found! Look, Mummy, look! But to go back to the splinter. She had really been rather unpleasant about that. "What do you mean, you didn't notice?" she had asked, scornful. "I just didn't notice, that's all." "I suppose you're going to tell me if I stick a pin into your foot you won't feel it?" "I didn't say that." And then she had jabbed him suddenly in the ankle with the pin she had been using to take out the splinter, and he hadn't been watching so he didn't know about it till she had cried out in a kind of horror. And when he had looked down, the pin was sticking into the flesh all by itself behind the anklebone, almost half of it buried. "Take it out," he had said. "You can poison someone like that." "You mean you can't feel it?" "Take it out, will you?" "You mean it doesn't hurt?" "The pain is terrible. Take it out." "What's the matter with you?" "I said the pain is terrible. Didn't you hear me?" Why did they do things like that to him? When I was down beside the sea, a wooden spade they gave to me, to dig the sandy shore. My holes were empty as a cup, and every time the sea came up, till it could come no more. A year ago the doctor had said, "Shut your eyes. Now tell me whether I'm pushing this toe up or down." "Up," he had said. "And now?" "Down. No, up. I think it's up." It was peculiar that a neuro-surgeon should want to play with his toes. "Did I get them all right, doctor?" "You did very well." But that was a year ago. He had felt pretty good a year ago. The sort of things that happened now never used to happen then. Take, for example, just one item--the bathroom tap. Why was the hot tap in the bathroom on a different side this morning? That was a new one. It is not of the least importance, you understand, but it would be interesting to know why. Do you think she could have changed it over, taken a spanner and a pipewrench and sneaked in during the night and changed it over? Do you? Well--if you really want to know--yes. The way she'd been acting lately, she'd be quite capable of doing that. A strange and difficult woman, that's what she was. Mind you, she used not to be, but there's no doubt at all that right now she was as strange and difficult as they come. Especially at night. Yes, at night. That was the worst time of all--the night. Why, when he put out his right hand in bed at night, could his fingers not feel what they were touching? He had knocked over the lamp and she had woken up and then sat up suddenly while he was feeling for it on the floor in the dark. "What are you doing now?" "I knocked over the lamp. I'm sorry." "Oh Christ," she had said. "Yesterday it was the glass of water. What's the matter with you?" Once, the doctor had stroked the back of his hand with a feather, and he hadn't been able to feel that either. But he had felt it when the man scratched him with a pin. "Shut your eyes. No--you mustn't look. Shut them tight. Now tell me if this is hot or cold." "Hot.",, And this?" "Cold." "And this?" "Cold. I mean hot. Yes, it's hot, isn't it?" "That's right," the doctor had said. "You did very well." But that was a year ago. Why were the switches on the walls, just lately, always a few inches away from the well-remembered places when he felt for them in the dark? Don't think about it, he told himself. The only thing is not to think about it. And while we're on the subject, why did the walls of the living-room take on a slightly different shade of colour each day? Green and blue-green and blue; and sometimes--sometimes slowly swimming like colours seen through the heat-haze of a brazier. One by one, neatly, like index cards out of a machine, the little questions dropped. Whose face appeared for one second at the window during dinner? Whose eyes? "What are you staring at?" "Nothing," he had answered. "But it would be nice if we could draw the curtains, don't you think? "Robert, what were you staring at?" "Nothing," "Why were you staring at the window like that?" "It would be nice if we could draw the curtains, don't you think?" he had answered. He was going past the place where he had heard the horse in the field and now he could hear it again; the breathing, the soft hoof thuds, and the crunch of grass-cropping that was like the noise of a man munching celery. "Hello old horse," he said, calling loud into the darkness. "Hello old horse over there." Suddenly he heard the footsteps behind him, slow, long-striding footsteps close behind, and he stopped. The footsteps stopped. He turned around, searching the darkness. "Good evening," he said, "You here again?" In the quiet that followed he could hear the wind moving the leaves in the hedge. "Are you going my way?" he said. Then he turned and walked on, the dog still pulling ahead, and the footsteps started after him again, but more softly now, as though the person were walking on toes. He stopped and turned again. "I can't see you," he said, "because it's so dark. Are you someone I know?" Again the silence, and the cool summer wind on his cheeks, and the dog tugging on the leash to get home. "All right," he called. "You don't have to answer if you don't want to. But remember I know you're there." Someone trying to be clever. Far away in the night, over to the west and very high, he heard the faint hum of an aeroplane. He stopped again, head up, listening. "Miles away," he said. "Won't come near here." But why, when one of them flew over the house, did everything inside him come to a stop, and his talking and what he was doing, while he sat or stood in a sort of paralysis waiting for the whistle-shriek of the bomb. That one after dinner this evening. "Why did you duck like that?" she asked, "Duck?" "Why did you duck? What are you ducking for?" "Duck?" he had said again. "I don't know what you mean." "I'll say you don't," she had answered, staring at him hard with those hard, blue-white eyes, the lids dropping slightly, as always when there was contempt. The drop of her eyelids was something beautiful to him, the half-closed eyes and the way the lids dropped and the eyes became hooded when her contempt was extreme. Yesterday, lying in bed in the early morning, when the noise of gunfire was just beginning far away down the valley, he had reached out with his left hand and touched her body for a little comfort. "What on earth are you doing?" "Nothing, dear." "You woke me up." m sorry." It would be a help if she would only let him lie closer to her in the early mornings when he began to hear the noise of gunfire. He would soon be home now. Around the last bend of the lane he could see a light glowing pink through the curtain of the living-room window, and he hurried forward to the gate and through it and up the path to the front door, the dog still pulling ahead. He stood on the porch, feeling around for the door-knob in the dark. It was on the right when he went out. He distinctly remembered it being on the right-hand side when he shut the door half an hour ago and went out. It couldn't be that she had changed that over too? Just to fox him? Taken a bag of tools and quickly changed it over to the other side while he was out walking the dog? He moved his hand over to the left--and the moment the fingers touched the knob, something small but violent exploded inside his head and with it a surge of fury and outrage and fear. He opened the door, shut it quickly behind him and shouted "Edna, are you there?" There was no answer so he shouted again, and this time she heard him. "What do you want now? You woke me up." "Come down here a moment, will you. I want to talk to you." "Oh for heaven's sake," she answered. "Be quiet and come on up." "Come here!" he shouted. "Come here at once!" "I'll be damned if I will. You come here." The man paused, head back, looking up the stairs into the dark of the second floor. He could see where the stair-rail curved to the left and went on up out of sight in the black towards the landing and if you went straight on across the landing you came to the bedroom, and it would be black in there too. "Edna!" he shouted. "Edna!" "Oh go to hell." He began to move slowly up the stairs, treading quietly, touching the stairrail for guidance, up and around the lefthand curve into the dark above. At the top he took an extra step that wasn't there; but he was ready for it and there was no noise. He paused awhile then, listening, and he wasn't sure, but he thought he could hear the guns starting up again far away down the valley, heavy stuff mostly, seventy-fives and maybe a couple of mortars somewhere in the background. Across the landing now and through the open doorway--which was easy in the dark because he knew it so well--through on to the bedroom carpet that was thick and soft and pale grey although he could not feel or see it. In the centre of the room he waited, listening for sounds. She had gone back to sleep and was breathing rather loud, making the slightest little whistle with the air between her teeth each time she exhaled. The curtain flapped gently against the open window, the alarm-clock tick-tick-ticked beside the bed. Now that his eyes were becoming accustomed to the dark he could just make out the end of the bed, the white blanket tucked in under the mattress, the bulge of her feet under the bedclothes; and then, as though aware of the presence of the man in the room, the woman stirred. He heard her turn, and turn again. The sound of her breathing stopped. There was a succession of little movement-noises and once the bedsprings creaked, loud as a shout in the dark. "Is that you, Robert?" He made no move, no sound. "Robert, are you there?" The voice was strange and rather unpleasant to him. "Robert!" She was wide awake now. "Where are you?" Where had he heard that voice before? It had a quality of stridence, dissonance, like two single high notes struck together hard in discord. Also there was an inability to pronounce the R of Robert. Who was it that used to say Wobert to him? "Wobert," she said again. "What are you doing?" Was it that nurse in the hospital, the tall one with fair hair? No, it was further back. Such an awful voice as that he ought to remember. Give him a little time and he would get the name. At that moment he heard the snap of the switch of the bedside lamp and in the flood of light he saw the woman half-sitting up in bed, dressed in some sort of a pink nightdress. There was a surprised, wide-eyed expression on her face. Her cheeks and chin were oily with cold cream. "You better put that thing down," she was saying, "before you cut yourself." "Where's Edna?" He was staring at her hard. The woman, half-sitting up in bed, watched him carefully. He was standing at the foot of the bed, a huge, broad man, standing motionless, erect, with heels together, almost at attention, dressed in his dark-brown, woolly, heavy suit. "Go on," she ordered. "Put it down." "Where's Edna?" "What's the matter with you, Wobert?" "There's nothing the matter with me. I'm just asking you where's my wife?" The woman was easing herself up gradually into an erect sitting position and sliding her legs towards the edge of the bed. "Well," she said at length, the voice changing, the hard blue-white eyes secret and cunning, "if you really want to know, Edna's gone. She left just now while you were out." "Where did she go?" "She didn't say." "And who are you?" "I'm just a friend of hers." "You don't have to shout at me," he said. "What's all the excitement?" "I simply want you to know I'm not Edna." The man considered this a moment, then he said, "How did you know my name?" "Edna told me." slightly he paused, studying her closely, still Slightly puzzled, but much calmer now, his eyes calm, perhaps even a little amused the way they looked at her. "I think I prefer Edna." In the silence that followed they neither of them moved. The woman was very tense, sitting up straight with her arms tense on either side of her and slightly bent at the elbows, the hands pressing palms downward on the mattress. "I love Edna, you know. Did she ever tell you I love her?" The woman didn't answer. "I think she's a bitch. But it's a funny thing I love her just the same." The woman was not looking at the man's face; she was watching his right hand. "Awful cruel little bitch, Edna." And a long silence now, the man standing erect, motionless, the woman sitting motionless in the bed, and it was so quiet suddenly that through the open window they could hear the water in the millstream going over the dam far down the valley on the next farm. Then the man again, speaking calmly, slowly, quite impersonally: "As a matter of fact, I don't think she even likes me any more." The woman shifted closer to the edge of the bed. "Put that knife down," she said, "before you cut yourself." "Don't shout, please. Can't you talk nicely?" Now, suddenly, the man leaned forward, staring intently into the woman's face, and he raised his eyebrows. "That's strange," he said. "That's very strange." He took a step forward, his knees touching the bed. "You look a bit like Edna yourself." "Edna's gone out. I told you that." He continued to stare at her and the woman kept quite still, the palms of her hands pressing deep into the mattress. "Well," he said. "I wonder." "I told you Edna's gone out. I'm a friend of hers. My name is Mary." "My wife," the man said, "has a funny little brown mole just behind her left ear. You don't have that, do you?" "I certainly don't." "Turn your head and let me look." "I told you I didn't have it." "Just the same, I'd like to make sure." The man came slowly around the end of the bed. "Stay where you are," he said. "Please don't move." And he came towards her slowly, watching her all the time, a little smile touching the corners of his mouth. The woman waited until he was within reach, and then, with a quick right hand, so quick he never saw it coming, she smacked him hard across the front of the face. And when he sat down on the bed and began to cry, she took the knife from his hand and went swiftly out of the room, down the stairs to the hail, where the telephone was.
I do not remember much of it; not beforehand anyway; not until it happened. There was the landing at Fouka, where the Blenheimboys were helpful and gave us tea while we were being refuelled. I remember the quietness of the Blenheimboys, how they came into the mess-tent to get some tea and sat down to drink it without saying anything; how they got up and went out when they had finished drink ing and still they did not say anything. And I knew that each one was holding himself together because the going was not very good right then. They were having to go out too often, and there were no replacements coming along. We thanked themfor the tea and went out to see if they had finished refuelling our Gladiators. I remember that there was a wind blowing which made the wind-sock stand out straight, like a signpost, and the sand was blowing up around our legs and making a rustling noise as it swished against the tents, and the tents flapped in the wind so that they were like canvas men clapping their hands. "Bomber boys unhappy," Peter said. "Not unhappy," I answered. "Well, they're browned off." "No. They've had it, that's all. But they'll keep going. You can see they're trying to keep going." Our two old Gladiators were standing beside each other in the sand and the airmen in their khaki shirts and shorts seemed still to be busy with refuelling. I was wearing a thin white cotton flying suit and Peter had on a blue one. It wasn't necessary to fly with anything warmer. Peter said, "How far away is it?" "Twenty-one miles beyond Charing Cross," I answered, "on the right side of the road." Charing Cross was where the desert road branched north to Mersah Matruh. The Italian army was outside Mersah, and they were doing pretty well. It was about the only time, so far as I know, that the Italians have done pretty well. Their morale goes up and down like a sensitive altimeter, and right then it was at forty thousand because the Axis was on top of the world. We hung around waiting for the refuelling to finish. Peter said, "It's a piece of cake." "Yes. It ought to be easy." We separated and I climbed into my cockpit. I have always remembered the face of the airman who helped me to strap in. He was oldish, about forty, and bald except for a neat patch of golden hair at the back of his head. His face was all wrinkles, his eyes were like my grandmother's eyes, and he looked as though he had spent his life helping to strap in pilots who never came back. He stood on the wing pulling my straps and said, "Be careful. There isn't any sense not being careful." "Piece of cake," I said. "Like hell." "Really. It isn't anything at all. It's a piece of cake." I don't remember much about the next bit; I only remember about later on. I suppose we took off fromFouka and flew west towards Mersah, and I suppose we flew at about eight hundred feet. I suppose we saw the sea to starboard, and I suppose -- no, I amcertain -- that it was blue and that it was beautiful, especially where it rolled up on to the sand and made a long thick white line east and west as far as you could see. I suppose we flew over Charing Cross and flew on for twenty-one miles to where they had said it would be, but I do not know. I know only that there was trouble, lots and lots of trouble, and I know that we had turned and were coming back when the trouble got worse. The biggest trouble of all was that I was too low to bale out, and it is fromthat point on that my memory comes back to me. I remember the dipping of the nose of the aircraft and I remember looking down the nose of the machine at the ground and seeing a little clump of camel-thorn growing there all by itself. I remember seeing some rooks lying in the sand beside the camel-thorn, and the camel-thorn and the sand and the rocks leapt out of the ground and came to me. I remember that very clearly. Then there was a small gap of not-remembering. It might have been one second or it might have been thirty; I do not know. I have an idea that it was very short, a second perhaps, and next I heard a crumph on the right as the starboard wing tank caught fire, then another crumph on the left as the port tank did the same. To me that was not significant, and for a while I sat still, feeling comfortable, but a little drowsy. I couldn't see with my eyes, but that was not significant either. There was nothing to worry about. Nothing at all. Not until I felt the hotness around my legs. At first it was only a warmness and that was all right too, but all at once it was a hotness, a very stinging scorching hotness up and down the sides of each leg. I knew that the hotness was unpleasant, but that was all I knew. I disliked it, so I curled my legs up under the seat and waited. I think there was something wrong with the telegraph systembetween the body and the brain. It did not seemto be working very well. Some how it was a bit slow in telling the brain all about it and in asking for instructions. But I believe a message eventually got through, saying, "Down here there is a great hotness. What shall we do? (Signed) Left Leg and Right Leg." For a long time there was no reply. The brain was figuring the matter out. Then slowly, word by word, the answer was tapped over the wires. 'The -- plane -- is -- burning. Get -- out -- repeat -- get -- out -- get -- out." The order was relayed to the whole system, to all the muscles in the legs, arms and body, and the muscles went to work. They tried their best; they pushed a little and pulled a little, and they strained greatly, but it wasn't any good. Up went another telegram, "Can't get out. Something holding us in." The answer to this one took even longer in arriving, SO I just sat there waiting for it to come, and all the time the hotness increased. Something was holding me down and it was up to the brain to find out what it was. Was it giants' hands pressing on my shoulders, or heavy stones or houses or steamrollers or filing cabinets or gravity or was it ropes? Wait a minute. Ropes -- ropes. The message was beginning to come through. It came very slowly. "Your -- straps. Undo -- your -- straps." My arms received the message and went to work. They tugged at the straps, but they wouldn't undo. They tugged again and again, a little feebly, but as hard as they could, and it wasn't any use. Back went the message, "How do we undo the straps?" This time I think that I sat there for three or four minutes waiting for the answer. It wasn't any use hurrying or getting impatient. That was the one thing of which I was sure. But what a long time it was all taking. I said aloud, "Bugger it. I'mgoing to be burnt. I'm. . ." but I was interrupted. The answer was coming -- no, it wasn't -- yes, it was, it was slowly coming through. "Pull -- out -- the -- quick -- release - - pin -- you -- bloody -- fool -- and -- hurry." Out came the pin and the straps were loosed. Now, let's get out. Let's get out, let's get out. But I couldn't do it. I simply couldn't lift myself out of the cockpit. Arms and legs tried their best but it wasn't any use. A last desperate message was flashed upwards and this time it was marked "Urgent". "Something else is holding us down," it said. "Some thing else, something else, something heavy." Still the arms and legs did not fight. They seemed to know instinctively that there was no point in using up their strength. They stayed quiet and waited for the answer, and oh what a time it took. Twenty, thirty, forty hot seconds. None of themreally white hot yet, no sizzling of flesh or smell of burning meat, but that would come any moment now, because those old Gladiators aren't made of stressed steel like a Hurricane or a Spit. They have taut canvas wings, covered with magnificently inflammable dope, and underneath there are hundreds of small thin sticks, the kind you put under the logs for kindling, only these are drier and thinner. If a clever man said, 'I amgoing to build a big thing that will burn better and quicker than anything else in the world,' and if he applied himself diligently to his task, he would probably finish up by building something very like a Gladiator. I sat still waiting. Then suddenly the reply, beautiful in its briefness, but at the same time explaining everything. "Your -- parachute -- turn -- the -- buckle." I turned the buckle, released the parachute harness and with some effort hoisted myself up and tumbled over the side of the cockpit. Something seemed to be burning, so I rolled about a bit in the sand, then crawled away fromthe fire on all fours and lay down. I heard some of my machine-gun ammunition going off in the heat and I heard some of the bullets thumping into the sand nearby. I did not worry about them; I merely heard them. Things were beginning to hurt. My face hurt most. There was something wrong with my face. Something had happened to it. Slowly I put up a hand to feel it. It was sticky. My nose didn't seemto be there. I tried to feel my teeth, but I cannot remember whether I came to any conclusion about them. I think I dozed off. All of a sudden there was Peter. I heard his voice and I heard himdancing around and yelling like a madman and shaking my hand and saying, "Jesus, I thought you were still inside. I came down half a mile away and ran like hell. Are you all right?" I said, "Peter, what has happened to my nose?" I heard himstriking a match in the dark. The night comes quickly in the desert. There was a pause. "It actually doesn't seemto be there very much," he said. "Does it hurt?" "Don't be a bloody fool, of course it hurts." He said he was going back to his machine to get some morphia out of his emergency pack, but he came back again soon, saying he couldn't find his aircraft in the dark. "Peter," I said, "I can't see anything." "It's night," he answered. "I can't see either." It was cold now. It was bitter cold, and Peter lay down close alongside so that we could both keep a little warmer. Every now and then he would say, "I've never seen a man without a nose before." I kept spewing a lot of blood and every time I did it, Peter lit a match. Once he gave me a cigarette, but it got wet and I didn't want it anyway. I do not know how long we stayed there and I re member only very little more. I remember that I kept telling Peter that there was a tin of sore throat tablets in my pocket, and that he should take one, otherwise he would catch my sore throat. I remember asking himwhere we were and himsaying, "We're between the two armies," and then I remember English voices froman English patrol asking if we were Italians. Peter said something to them; I cannot remember what he said. Later I remember hot thick soup and one spoonful making me sick. And all the time the pleasant feeling that Peter was around, being wonderful, doing wonder ful things and never going away. That is all that I can remember. The men stood beside the aeroplane painting away and talking about the heat. "Painting pictures on the aircraft," I said. "Yes," said Peter. "It's a great idea. It's subtle." "Why?" I said. "Just you tell me." "They're funny pictures," he said. "The German pilots will all laugh when they see them; they'll shake so with their laughing that they won't be able to shoot straight." "Oh baloney baloney baloney." "No, it's a great idea. It's fine. Come and have a look." We ran towards the line of aircraft. "Hop, skip, jump," said Peter. "Hop skip jump, keep in time." "Hop skip jump," I said, "Hop skip jump," and we danced along. The painter on the first aeroplane had a straw hat on his head and a sad face. He was copying the drawing out of a magazine, and when Peter saw it he said, "Boy oh boy look at that picture," and he began to laugh. His laugh began with a rumble and grew quickly into a belly-roar and he slapped his thighs with his hands both at the same time and went on laughing with his body doubled up and his mouth wide open and his eyes shut. His silk top hat fell off his head on to the sand. "That's not funny," I said. "Not funny!" he cried. "What d'you mean 'not funny'? Look at me. Look at me laughing. Laughing like this I couldn't hit anything. I couldn't hit a hay wagon or a house or a louse." And he capered about on the sand, gurgling and shaking with laughter. Then he seized me by the armand we danced over to the next aeroplane. "Hop skip jump," he said. "Hop skip jump." There was a small man with a crumpled face writing a long story on the fuselage with a red crayon. His straw hat was perched right on the back of his head and his face was shiny with sweat. "Good morning," he said. "Good morning, good morn ing," and he swept his hat off his head in a very elegant way. Peter said, "Shut up," and bent down and began to read what the little man had been writing. All the time Peter was splattering and rumbling with laughter, and as he read he began to laugh afresh. He rooked fromone side to the other and danced around on the sand slap ping his thighs with his hands and bending his body. "Oh my, what a story, what a story, what a story. Look at me. Look at me laughing," and he hopped about on his toes, shaking his head and chortling like a madman. Then suddenly I saw the joke and I began to laugh with him. I laughed so much that my stomach hurt and I fell down and rolled around on the sand and roared and roared because it was so funny that there was nothing else I could do. "Peter, you're marvellous," I shouted. "But can all those German pilots read English?" "Oh hell," he said. "Oh hell. Stop," he shouted. "Stop your work," and the painters all stopped their painting and turned round slowly and looked at Peter. They did a little caper on their toes and began to chant in unison. "Rubbishy things -- on all the wings, on all the wings, on all the wings," they chanted. "Shut up," said Peter. "We're in a jam. We must keep calm. Where's my top hat?" "What?" I said. "You can speak German," he said. "You must translate for us. He will translate for you," he shouted to the painters. "He will translate." Then I saw his black top hat lying in the sand. I looked away, then I looked around and saw it again. It was a silk opera hat and it was lying there on its side in the sand. "You're mad," I shouted. "You're madder than hell. You don't know what you're doing. You'll get us all killed. You're absolutely plumb crazy, do you know that? You're crazier than hell. My God, you're crazy." "Goodness, what a noise you're making. You mustn't shout like that; it's not good for you." This was a woman's voice. "You've made youself all hot," she said, and I felt someone wiping my forehead with a hand kerchief. "You mustn't work yourself up like that." Then she was gone and I saw only the sky, which was pale blue. There were no clouds and all around were the German fighters. They were above, below and on every side and there was no way I could go; there was nothing I could do. They took it in turns to come in to attack and they flew their aircraft carelessly, banking and looping and dancing in the air. But I was not frightened, because of the funny pictures on my wings. I was con fident and I thought, "I amgoing to fight a hundred of themalone and I'll shoot themall down. I'll shoot themwhile they are laughing; that's what I'll do." Then they flew closer. The whole sky was full of them. There were so many that I did not know which ones to watch and which ones to attack. There were so many that they made a black curtain over the sky and only here and there could I see a little of the blue showing through. But there was enough to patch a Dutchman's trousers, which was all that mattered. So long as there was enough to do that, then everything was all right. Still they flew closer. They came nearer and nearer, right up in front of my face so that I saw only the black crosses which stood out brightly against the colour of the Messerschmitts and against the blue of the sky; and as I turned my head quickly fromone side to the other I saw more aircraft and more crosses and then I saw nothing but the arms of the crosses and the blue of the sky. The arms had hands and they joined together and made a circle and danced around my Gladiator, while the engines of the Messerschmitts sang joyfully in a deep voice. They were playing Oranges and Lemons and every now and then two would detach themselves and come out into the middle of the floor and make an attack and I knew then that it was Oranges and Lemons. They banked and swerved and danced upon their toes and they leant against the air first to one side, then to the other. "Oranges and Lemons said the bells of St Clement's," sang the engines. But I was still confident. I could dance better than they and I had a better partner. She was the most beautiful girl in the world. I looked down and saw the curve of her neck and the gentle slope of her pale shoulders and I saw her slender arms, eager and out stretched. Suddenly I saw some bullet holes in my starboard wing and I got angry and soared both at the same time; but mostly I got angry. Then I got confident and I said, "The German who did that had no sense of humour. There's always one man in a party who has no sense of humour. But there's nothing to worry about; there's nothing at all to worry about." Then I saw more bullet holes and I got scared. I slid back the hood of the cockpit and stood up and shouted, "You fools, look at the funny pictures. Look at the one on my tail; look at the story on my fuselage. Please look at the story on my fuselage." But they kept on coming. They tripped into the middle of the floor in twos, shooting at me as they came. And the engines of the Messerschmitts sang loudly. "When will you pay me? said the bells of Old Bailey," sang the engines, and as they sang the black crosses danced and swayed to the rhythmof the music. There were more holes in my wings, in the engine cowling and in the cockpit. Then suddenly there were some in my body. But there was no pain, even when I went into a spin, when the wings of my plane went flip, flip, flip, faster and faster, when the blue sky and the black sea chased each other round and round until there was no longer any sky or sea but just the flashing of the sun as I turned. But the black crosses were following me down, still dancing and still holding hands and I could still hear the singing of their engines. "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head," sang the engines. Still the wings went flip flip, flip, flip, and there was neither sky nor sea around me, but only the sun. Then there was only the sea. I could see it below me and I could see the white horses, and I said to myself, "Those are white horses riding a rough sea." I knew then that my brain was going well because of the white horses and because of the sea. I knew that there was not much time because the sea and the white horses were nearer, the white horses were bigger and the sea was like a sea and like water, not like a smooth place. Then there was only one white horse, rushing forward madly with his bit in his teeth, foaming at the mouth, scattering the spray with his hooves and arching his neck as he ran. He galloped on madly over the sea, riderless and un controllable, and I could tell that we were going to crash. After that it was warmer, and there were no black crosses and there was no sky. But it was only warmbecause it was not hot and it was not cold. I was sitting in a great red chair made of velvet and it was evening. There was a wind blowing frombehind. "Where amI?" I said. "You are missing. You are missing, believed killed." "Then I must tell my mother." "You can't. You can't use that phone." "Why not?" "It goes only to God." "What did you say I was?" "Missing, believed killed." "That's not true. It's a lie. It's a lousy lie because here I amand I'mnot missing. You're just trying to frighten me and you won't succeed. You won't succeed, I tell you, because I know it's a lie and I'm going back to my squadron. You can't stop me because I'll just go. I'mgoing, you see, I'mgoing." I got up fromthe red chair and began to run. "Let me see those X-rays again, nurse." "They're here, doctor." This was the woman's voice again, and now it came closer. "You have been making a noise tonight, haven't you? Let me straighten your pillow for you, you're pushing it on to the floor." The voice was close and it was very soft and nice. "AmI missing?" "No, of course not. You're fine." "They said I was missing." "Don't be silly; you're fine." Oh everyone's silly, silly, silly, but it was a lovely day, and I did not want to run but I couldn't stop. I kept on running across the grass and I couldn't stop because my legs were carrying me and I had no control over them. It was as if they did not belong to me, although when I looked down I saw that they were mine, that the shoes on the feet were mine and that the legs were joined to my body. But they would not do what I wanted; they just went on running across the field and I had to go with them. I ran and ran and ran, and although in some places the field was rough and bumpy, I never stumbled. I ran past trees and hedges and in one field there were some sheep which stopped their eating and scampered off as I ran past them. Once I saw my mother in a pale grey dress bending down picking mushrooms, and as I ran past she looked up and said, "My basket's nearly full; shall we go home soon?" but my legs wouldn't stop and I had to go on. Then I saw the cliff ahead and I saw how dark it was beyond the cliff. There was this great cliff and beyond it there was nothing but darkness, although the sun was shining in the field where I was running. The light of the sun stopped dead at the edge of the cliff and there was only darkness beyond. "That must be where the night begins," I thought, and once more I tried to stop but it was not any good. My legs began to go faster towards the cliff and they began to take longer strides, and I reached down with my hand and tried to stop themby clutching the cloth of my trousers, but it did not work; then I tried to fall down. But my legs were nimble, and each time I threw myself I landed on my toes and went on running. Now the cliff and the darkness were much nearer and I could see that unless I stopped quickly I should go over the edge. Once more I tried to throw myself to the ground and once more I landed on my toes and went on running. I was going fast as I came to the edge and I went straight on over it into the darkness and began to fall. At first it was not quite dark. I could see little trees growing out of the face of the cliff, and I grabbed at themwith my hands as I went down. Several times I managed to catch hold of a branch, but it always broke off at once because I was so heavy and because I was falling so fast, and once I caught a thick branch with both hands and the tree leaned forward and I heard the snapping of the roots one by one until it came away fromthe cliff and I went on falling. Then it became darker because the sun and the day were in the fields far away at the top of the cliff, and as I fell I kept my eyes open and watched the darkness turn fromgrey-black to black, fromblack to jet black and fromjet black to pure liquid blackness which I could touch with my hands but which I could not see. But I went on falling, and it was so black that there was nothing anywhere and it was not any use doing anything or caring or thinking be cause of the blackness and because of the falling. It was not any use. "You're better this morning. You're much better." It was the woman's voice again. "Hallo." "Hallo; we thought you were never going to get conscious." "Where amI?" "In Alexandria; in hospital." "How long have I been here?" "Four days." "What time is it?" "Seven o'clock in the morning." "Why can't I see?" I heard her walking a little closer. "Oh, we've just put a bandage around your eyes for a bit." "How long for?" "Just for a while. Don't worry. You're fine. You were very lucky, you know." I was feeling my face with my fingers but I couldn't feel it; I could only feel something else. "What's wrong with my face?" I heard her coming up to the side of my bed and I felt her hand touching my shoulder. "You mustn't talk any more. You're not allowed to talk. It's bad for you. Just lie still and don't worry. You're fine." I heard the sound of her footsteps as she walked across the floor and I heard her open the door and shut it again. "Nurse," I said. "Nurse." But she was gone.
WHEN, about eight years ago, old Sir William Turton died and his son Basil inherited The Turton Press (as well as the title), I can remember how they started laying bets around Fleet Street as to how long it wouldbe before some nice young woman managedto persuade the little fellow that she must look after him. That is to say, him and his money. The new Sir Basil Turton was maybe forty years old at the time, a bachelor, a man of mild and simple character who up to then had shown no interest in anything at all except his collection of modern paintings and sculpture. No woman had disturbed him; no scandal or gossip had ever touched his name. But now that he had become the proprietor of quite a large newspaper and magazine empire, it was necessary for him to emerge from the calm of his father's country house and come up to London. Naturally, the vultures started gathering at once, and I believe that not only Fleet Street but very nearly the whole of the city was looking on eagerly as they scrambled for the body. It was slow motion, of course, deliberate and deadly slow motion, and therefore not so much like vultures as a bunch of agile crabs clawing for a piece of horsemeat under water. But to everyone's surprise the little chap proved to be remarkably elusive, and the chase dragged on right through the spring and early summer of that year. I did not know Sir Basil personally, nor did I have any reason to feel friendly towards him, but I couldn't help taking the side of my own sex and found myself cheering loudly every time he managed to get himself off the hook. Then, round about the beginning of August, apparently at some secret female signal, the girls declared a sort of truce among themselves while they went abroad, and rested, and regrouped, and made fresh plans for the winter kill. This was a mistake because precisely at that moment a dazzling creature called Natalia something or other, whom nobody had heard of before, swept in from the Continent, took Sir Basil firmly by the wrist and led him off in a kind of swoon to the Registry Office at Caxton Hall where she married him before anyone else, least of all the bridegroom, realized what was happening. You can imagine that the London ladies were indignant, and naturally they started disseminating a vast amount of fruity gossip about the new Lady Turton ('That dirty poacher,' they called her). But we don't have to go into that. In fact, for the purposes of this story we can skip the next six years, which brings us right up to the present, to an occasion exactly one week ago today when I myself had the pleasure of meeting her ladyship for the first time. By now, as you must have guessed, she was not only running the whole of The Turton Press, but as a result had become a considerable political force in the country. I realize that other women have done this sort of thing before, but what made her particular case unusual was the fact that she was a foreigner and that nobody seemed to know precisely what country she came from--Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, or Russia. So last Thursday I went to this small dinner party at a friend's in London, and while we were standing around in the drawing-room before the meal, sipping good Martinis and talking about the atom bomb and Mr Bevan, the maid popped her head in to announce the last guest. "Lady Turton," she said. Nobody stopped talking; we were too well mannered for that. No heads were turned. Only our eyes swung round to the door, waiting for the entrance. She came in fast--tall and slim in a red-gold dress with sparkles on it--the mouth smiling, the hand outstretched towards her hostess, and my heavens, I must say she was a beauty. "Mildred, good evening!" "My dear Lady Turton! How nice!" I believe we did stop talking then, and we turned and stared and stood waiting quite meekly to be introduced, just like she might have been the Queen or a famous film star. But she was better looking than either of those. The hair was black, and to go with it she had one of those pale, oval, innocent fifteenthcentury Flemish faces, almost exactly a Madonna by Memling or Van Eyck. At least that was the first impression. Later, when my turn came to shake hands, I got a closer look and saw that except for the outline and colouring it wasn't really a Madonna at all--far, far from it. The nostrils for example were very odd, somehow more open, more flaring than any I had seen before, and excessively arched. This gave the whole nose a kind of open, snorting look that had something of the wild animal about it the mustang. And the eyes when I saw them close, were not wide and round the way the Madonna painters used to make them, but long and half-closed, half smiling, half sullen, and slightly vulgar, so that in one way and another they gave her a most delicately dissipated air. What's more they didn't look at you directly. They came to you slowly from over on one side with a curious sliding motion that made me nervous. I tried to see their colour, thought it was pale grey, but couldn't be sure. Then she was led away across the room to meet other people. I stood watching her. She was clearly conscious of her success and of the way these Londoners were deferring to her. 'Here am I,' she seemed to be saying, 'and I only came over a few years ago, but already I am richer and more powerful than any of you.' There was a little prance of triumph in her walk. A few minutes later we went in to dinner, and to my surprise I found myself seated at her ladyship's right. I presumed that our hostess had done this as a kindness to me, thinking I might pick up some material for the social column I Write each day in the evening paper. I settled myself down ready for an interesting meal. But the famous lady took no notice of me at all; she spent her time talking to the man on her left; the host. Until at last, just as I was finishing my ice-cream, she suddenly turned, reached over, picked up my place card and read the name. Then, with that queer sliding motion of the eyes she looked into my face. I smiled and made a little bow. She didn't smile back, but started shooting questions at me, rather personal questions--job, age, family, things like that in a peculiar lapping voice, and I found myself answering as best I could. During this inquisition it came out among other things that I was a lover of painting and sculpture. "Then you should come down to the country some time and see my husband's collection." She said it casually, merely as a form of conversation, but you must realize that in my job I cannot afford to lose an opportunity like this. "How kind of you, Lady Turton. But I'd simply love to. When shall I come?" Her head went up and she hesitated, frowned, shrugged her shoulders and then said, "Oh I don't care. Any time." "How about this next week-end? Would that be all right?" The slow narrow eyes rested a moment on mine, then travelled away. "I suppose so, if you wish. I don't care." And that was how the following Saturday afternoon I came to be driving down to Wooton with my suitcase in the back of the car. You may think that perhaps I forced the invitation a bit, but I couldn't have got it any other way. And apart from the professional aspect, I personally wanted very much to see the house. As you know, Wooton is one of the truly great stone houses of the early English Renaissance. Like its sisters, Longleat, Wollaton, and Montacute, it was built in the latter half of the sixteenth Qentury when for the first time a great man's house could be designed as a comfortable dwelling, not as a castle, and when a new group of architects such as John Thorpe and the Smithsons were starting to do marvellous things all over the country. It lies south of Oxford, near a small town Qalled Princes Risborough not a long trip from London--and as I swung in through the main gates the sky was closing overhead nd the early winter evening was beginning. I went slowly up the long drive, trying to see As much of the grounds as possible, especially the famous topiary which I had heard such a bot about. And I must say it was an impressive Sight. On all sides there were massive yew trees, trimmed and clipped into many different Qomical shapes--hens, pigeons, bottles, boots, , Armchairs, castles, egg-cups, lanterns, old women with flaring petticoats, tall pillars, some crowned With a ball, others with big rounded roofs and stemless mushroom finials--and in the half darkness the greens had turned to black so that each figure, each tree, took on a dark, smooth Sculptural quality. At one point I saw a lawn covered with gigantic chessmen, each a live yew tree, marvellously fashioned. I stopped the car, got out and walked among them, and they were twice as tall as me. What's more the set was complete, kings, queens, bishops, knights, rooks and pawns standing in position as for the start of a game. Around the next bend I saw the great grey house itself, and in front of it the large entrance forecourt enclosed by a high balustraded wall with small pillared pavilions at its outer angles. The piers of the balustrades were surmounted by stone obelisks--the Italian influence on the Tudor mind--and a flight of steps at least a hundred feet wide led up to the house. As I drove into the forecourt I noticed with rather a shock that the fountain basin in the middle supported a large statue by Epstein. A lovely thing, mind you, but surely not in sympathy with its surroundings. Then, looking back as I climbed the stairway to the front door, I saw that on all the little lawns and terraces round about there were other modern statues and many kinds of curious sculpture. In the distance I thought I recognized Gaudier Brzeska, Brancusi, Saint-Gaudens, Henry Moore, and Epstein again. The door was opened by a young footman who led me up to a bedroom on the first floor. Her ladyship, he explained, was resting, so were the other guests, but they would all be down in the main drawing-room in an hour or so, dressed for dinner. Now in my job it is necessary to do a lot of week-ending. I suppose I spend around fifty Saturdays and Sundays a year in other people's houses, and as a result I have become fairly sensitive to unfamiliar atmosphere. I can tell good or bad almost by sniffing with my nose the moment I get in the front door; and this one I was in now I did not like. The place smelled wrong. There was the faint, desiccated whiff of something troublesome in the air; I was conscious of it even as I lay steaming luxuriously in my great marble bath; and I couldn't help hoping that no unpleasant things were going to happen before Monday came. The first of them--though more of a surprise than an unpleasantness-- occurred ten minutes later. I was sitting on the bed putting on my socks when softly the door opened, and an ancient lopsided gnome in black tails slid into the room. He was the butler, he explained, and his name was Jelks, and he did so hope I was comfortable and had everything I wanted. I told him I was and had. He said he would do all he could to make my week-end agreeable. I thanked him and waited for him to go. He hesitated, and then, in a voice dripping with unction, he begged permission to mention a rather delicate matter. I told him to go ahead. To be quite frank, he said, it was about tipping. The whole business of tipping made him acutely miserable. Oh? And why was that? Well, if I really wanted to know, he didn't like the idea that his guests felt under an obligation to tip him when they left the house--as indeed they did. It was an undignified proceeding for the tipping and the tipped. Moreover, he was well aware of the anguish that was often created in the minds of guests such as myself, if I would pardon the liberty, who might feel compelled by convention to give more than they could really afford. He paused, and two small crafty eyes watched my face for a sign. I murmured that he needn't worry himself about such things as far as I was concerned. On the contrary, he said, he hoped sincerely that I would agree from the beginning to give him no tip at all. "Well," I said. "Let's not fuss about it now, and when the time comes we'll see how we feel." "No, sir!" he cried. "Please, I really must insist." So I agreed. He thanked me, and shuffled a step or two closer. Then, laying his head on one side and clasping his hands before him like a priest, he gave a tiny apologetic shrug of the shoulders. The small sharp eyes were still watching me, and I waited, one sock on, the other in my hands, trying to guess what was coming next. All that he would ask, he said softly, so softly now that his voice was like music heard faintly in the street outside a great concert hail, all that he would ask was that instead of a tip I should give him thirty-three and a third per cent of my winnings at cards over the week-end. If I lost there would be nothing to pay. It was all so soft and smooth and sudden that I was not even surprised. "Do they play a lot of cards, Jeiks?" "Yes, sir, a great deal." "Isn't thirty-three and a third a bit steep?" "I don't think so, sir." "I'll give you ten per cent." "No, sir, I couldn't do that." He was now examining the finger-nails of his left hand, and patiently frowning. "Then we'll make it fifteen. All right?" "Thirty-three and a third, sir. It's very reasonable. After all, sir, seeing that I don't even know if you are a good player, what I'm actually doing, not meaning to be personal, is backing a horse and I've never even seen it run." No doubt you think I should never have started bargaining with the butler in the first place, and perhaps you are right. But being a liberal-minded person, I always try my best to be affable with the lower classes. Apart from that, the more I thought about it, the more I had to admit to myself that it was an offer no sportsman had the right to reject. "All right then, Jeiks. As you wish." "Thank you, sir." He moved towards the door, walking slowly sideways like a crab; but once more he hesitated, a hand on the knob. "If I may give a little advice, sir may I?" "Yes?" "It's simply that her ladyship tends to overbid her hand." Now this was going too far. I was so startled I dropped my sock. After all, it's one thing to have a harmless little sporting arrangement with the butler about tipping, but when he begins conniving with you to take money away from the hostess then it's time to call a halt. "All right Jeiks. Now that'll do." "No offence, sir, I hope. All I mean is you're bound to be playing against her ladyship. She always partners Major Haddock." "Major Haddock? You mean Major Jack Haddock?" "Yes, sir." I noticed there was a trace of a sneer around the corner of Jelks's nose when he spoke about this man. And it was worse with Lady Turton. Each time he said 'her ladyship' he spoke the words with the outsides of his lips as though he were nibbling a lemon, and there was a subtle, mocking inflection in his voice. "You'll excuse me now, sir. Her ladyship will be down at seven o'clock. So will Major Haddock and the others." He slipped out of the door leaving behind him a certain dampness in the room and a faint smell of embrocation. Shortly after seven, I found my way to the main drawing-room, and Lady Turton, as beautiful as ever, got up to greet me. "I wasn't even sure you were coming," she said in that peculiar lilting voice. "What's your name again?" "I'm afraid I took you at your word, Lady Turton. I hope it's all right." "Why not?" she said. "There's forty-seven bedrooms in the house. This is my husband." A small man came around the back of her and said, "You know, I'm so glad you were able to come." He had a lovely warm smile and when he took my hand I felt instantly a touch of friendship in his fingers. "And Carmen La Rosa," Lady Turton said. This was a powerfully built woman who looked as though she might have something to do with horses. She nodded at me, and although my hand was already half-way out she didn't give me hers, thus forcing me to convert the movement into a noseblow. "You have a cold?" she said. "I'm sorry." I did not like this Miss Carmen La Rosa. "And this is Jack Haddock." I knew this man slightly. He was a director of companies (whatever that may mean), and a well-known member of society. I had used his name a few times in my column, but I had never liked him, and this I think was mainly because I have a deep suspicion of all people who carry their military titles back with them into private life-especially majors and colonels. Standing there in his dinner-jacket with his full-blooded animal face and black eyebrows and large white teeth, he looked so handsome there was almost something indecent about it. He had a way of raising his upper lip when he smiled, baring his teeth, and he was smiling now as he gave me a hairy brown hand. "I hope you're going to say some nice things about us in your column." "He better had," Lady Turton said, "or I'll say some nasty ones about him on my front page." I laughed, but all three of them, Lady Turton, Major Haddock, and Carmen La Rosa had already turned away and were settling themselves back on the sofa. Jelks gave me a drink, and Sir Basil drew me gently aside for a quiet chat at the other end of the room. Every now and then Lady Turton would call her husband to fetch her something--another Martini, a cigarette, an ashtray, a handkerchief--and he, half rising from his chair, would be forestalled by the watchful Jelks who fetched it for him. Clearly, Jeiks loved his master; and just as clearly he hated the wife. Each time he did something for her he made a little sneer with his nose and drew his lips together so they puckered like a turkey's bottom. At dinner, our hostess sat her two friends, Haddock and La Rosa, on either side of her. This unconventional arrangement left Sir Basil and me at the other end of the table where we were able to continue our pleasant talk about painting and sculpture. Of course it was obvious to me by now that the Major was infatuated with her ladyship. And again, although I hate to say it, it seemed as though the La Rosa woman was hunting the same bird. All this foolishness appeared to delight the hostess. But it did not delight her husband. I could see that he was conscious of the little scene all the time we were talking; and often his mind would wander from our subject and he would stop short in mid-sentence, his eyes travelling down to the other end of the table to settle pathetically for a moment on that lovely head with the black hair and the curiously flaring nostrils. He must have noticed then how exhilarated she was, how the hand that gestured as she spoke rested every now and again on the Major's arm, and how the other woman, the one who perhaps had something to do with horses, kept saying, "Nata-li-a? Now Nata-li-a, listen to me!" "Tomorrow," I said, "you must take me round and show me the sculptures you've put up in the garden." "Of course," he said, "with pleasure." He glanced again at the wife, and his eyes had a sort of supplicating look that was piteous beyond words. He was so mild and passive a man in every way that even now I could see there was no anger in him, no danger, no chance of an explosion. After dinner I was ordered straight to the card table to partner Miss Carmen La Rosa against Major Haddock and Lady Turton. Sir Basil sat quietly on the sofa with a book. There was nothing unusual about the game itself; it was routine and rather dull. But Jeiks was a nuisance. All evening he prowled around us, emptying ashtrays and asking about drinks and peering at our hands. He was obviously shortsighted and I doubt whether he saw much of what was going on because as you may or may not know, here in England no butler has ever been permitted to wear spectacles nor for that matter, a moustache. This is the golden, unbreakable rule and a very sensible one it is too, although I'm not quite sure what lies behind it. I presume that a moustache would make him look too much like a gentleman, and spectacles too much like an American, and where would we be then I should like to know? In any event Jelks was a nuisance all evening; and so was Lady Turton who was constantly called to the phone on newspaper business. At eleven o'clock she looked up from her cards and said, "Basil, it's time you went to bed." "Yes, my dear, perhaps it is." He closed the book, got up, and stood for a minute watching the play. "Are you having a good game?" he asked. The others didn't answer him so I said, "It's a nice game." "I'm so glad. And Jeiks will look after you and get anything you want." "Jelks can go to bed too," the wife said. I could hear Major Haddock breathing through his nose beside me, and the soft drop of the cards one by one on to the table, and then the sound of Jeiks's feet shuffling over the carpet towards us. "You wouldn't prefer me to stay, m'lady?" "No. Go to bed. You too, Basil." "Yes, my dear. Good night. Good night all." Jeiks opened the door for him, and he went slowly out followed by the butler. As soon as the next rubber was over, I said that I too wanted to go to bed. "All right," Lady Turton said. "Good night." I went up to my room, locked the door, took a pill, and went to sleep. The next morning, Sunday, I got up and dressed around ten o'clock and went down to the breakfast-room. Sir Basil was there before me, and Jeiks was serving him with grilled kidneys and bacon and fried tomatoes. He was delighted to see me and suggested that as soon as we had finished eating we should take a long walk around the grounds. I told him nothing would give me more pleasure. Half an hour later we started out, and you've no idea what a relief it was to get away from that house and into the open air. It was one of those warm shining days that come occasionally in mid-winter after a night of heavy rain, with a bright surprising sun and not a breath of wind. Bare trees seemed beautiful in the sunlight, water still dripping from the branches, and wet places all around were sparkling with diamonds. The sky had small faint clouds. "What a lovely day!" "Yes--isn't it a lovely day!" We spoke hardly another word during the walk; it wasn't necessary. But he took me everywhere and I saw it all--the huge chessmen and all the rest of the topiary. The elaborate garden houses, the pools, the fountains, the children's maze whose hedges were hornbeam and lime so that it was only good in summer when the leaves were out, and the parterres, the rockeries, the greenhouses with their vines and nectarine trees. And of course, the sculpture. Most of the contemporary European sculptors were there, in bronze, granite, limestone, and wood; and although it was a pleasure to see them warming and glowing in the sun, to me they still looked a trifle out of place in these vast formal surroundings. "Shall we rest here now a little while?" Sir Basil said after we had walked for more than half an hour. So we sat down on a white bench beside a water-lily pond full of carp and goldfish, and lit cigarettes. We were some way from the house, on a piece of ground that was raised above its surroundings, and from where we sat the gardens were spread out below us like a drawing in one of those old books on garden architecture, with the hedges and lawns and terraces and fountains making a pretty pattern of squares and rings. "My father bought this place just before I was born," Sir Basil said. "I've lived here ever since, and I know every inch of it. Each day I grow to love it more." "It must be wonderful in summer." "Oh, but it is. You should come down and see it in May and June. Will you promise to do that?" "Of course," I said. "I'd love to come," and as I spoke I was watching the figure of a woman dressed in red moving among the flower-beds in the far distance. I saw her cross over a wide expanse of lawn, and there was a lilt in her walk, a little shadow attending her, and when she was over the lawn, she turned left and went along one side of a high wall of clipped yew until she came to another smaller lawn that was circular and had in its centre a piece of sculpture. "This garden is younger than the house," Sir Basil said. "It was laid out early in the eighteenth century by a Frenchman called Beaumont, the same fellow who did Levens, in Westmorland. For at least a year he had two hundred and fifty men working on it." The woman in the red dress had been joined now by a man, and they were standing face to face, about a yard apart, in the very centre of the whole garden panorama, on this little circular patch of lawn, apparently conversing. The man had some small black object in his hand. "If you're interested I'll show you the bills that Beaumont put in to the Duke while he was making it." "I'd like very much to see them. They must be fascinating." "He paid his labourers a shilling a day and they worked ten hours." In the clear sunlight it was not difficult to follow the movements and gestures of the two figures on the lawn. They had turned now towards the piece of sculpture, and were pointing at it in a sort of mocking way, apparently laughing and making jokes about its shape. I recognized it as being one of the Henry Moores, done in wood, a thin smooth object of singular beauty that had two or three holes in it and a number of strange limbs protruding. "When Beaumont planted the yew trees for the chess-men and the other things, he knew they wouldn't amount to much for at least a hundred years. We don't seem to possess that sort of patience in our planning these days, do we? What do you think?" "No," I said. "We don't." The black object in the man's hand turned out to be a camera, and now he had stepped back and was taking pictures of the woman beside the Henry Moore. She was striking a number of different poses, all of them, so far as I could see, ludicrous and meant to be amusing. Once she put her arms around one of the protruding wooden limbs and hugged it, and another time she climbed up and sat side-saddle on the thing, holding imaginary reins in her hands. A great wall of yew hid these two people from the house, and indeed from all the rest of the garden except the little hill on which we sat. They had every right to believe they were not overlooked, and even if they had happened to glance our way--which was into the sun--I doubt whether they would have noticed the two small motionless figures sitting on the bench beside the pond. "You know, I love these yews." Sir Basil said. "The colour of them is so wonderful in a garden because it rests the eye. And in the summer it breaks up the areas of brilliance into little patches and makes them more comfortable to admire. Have you noticed the different shades of greens on the planes and facets of each clipped tree?" "It's lovely, isn't it." The man now seemed to be explaining something to the woman, and pointing at the Henry Moore, and I could tell by the way they threw back their heads that they were laughing again. The man continued to point, and then the woman walked around the back of the wood carving, bent down and poked her head through one of its holes. The thing was about the size, shall I say, of a small horse, but thinner than that, and from where I sat I could see both sides of it--to the left, the woman's body, to the right, her head protruding through. It was very much like one of those jokes at the seaside where you put your head through a hole in a board and get photographed as a fat lady. The man was photographing her now. "There's another thing about yews," Sir Basil said. "In the early summer when the young shoots come out... " At that moment he paused and sat up straighter and leaned slightly forward, and I could sense his whole body suddenly stiffening. "Yes," I said, "when the young shoots come out?" The man had taken the photograph, but the woman still had her head through the hole, and now I saw him put both hands (as well as the camera) behind his back and advance towards her. Then he bent forward so his face was close to hers, touching it, and he held it there while he gave her, I suppose, a few kisses or something like that. In the stillness that followed, I fancied I heard a faint faraway tinkle of female laughter coming to us through the sunlight across the garden. "Shall we go back to the house?" I asked. "Back to the house?" "Yes, shall we go back and have a drink before lunch?" "A drink? Yes, we'll have a drink." But he didn't move. He sat very still, gone far away from me now, staring intently at the two figures. I also was staring at them. I couldn't take my eyes away; I had to look. It was like seeing a dangerous little ballet in miniature from a great distance, and you knew the dancers and the music but not the end of the story, not the choreography, nor what they were going to do next, and you were fascinated, and you had to look. "Gaudier Brzeska," I said. "How great do you think he might've become if he hadn't died so young?" "Who?" "Gaudier Brzeska." "Yes," he said. "Of course." I noticed now that something queer was happening. The woman still had her head through the hole, but she was beginning to wriggle her body from side to side in a slow unusual manner, and the man was standing motionless, a pace or so away watching her. He seemed suddenly uneasy the way he stood there, and I could tell by the drop of the head and by the stiff intent set of the body that there was no laughter in him any more. For a while he remained still, then I saw him place his camera on the ground and go forward to the woman, taking her head in his hands; and all at once it was more like a puppet show than a ballet, with tiny wooden figures performing tiny, jerky movements, crazy and unreal, on a faraway sunlit stage. We sat quietly together on the white bench, and we watched while the tiny puppet man began to manipulate the woman's head with his hands. He was doing it gently, there was no doubt about that, slowly and gently, stepping back every now and then to think about it some more, and several times crouching down to survey the situation from another angle. Whenever he left her alone the woman would start to wriggle her body, and the peculiar way she did it reminded me of a dog that feels a collar round its neck for the first time. "She's stuck," Sir Basil said. And now the man was walking to the other side of the carving, the side where the woman's body was, and he put out his hands and began trying to do something with her neck. Then, as though suddenly exasperated, he gave the neck two or three jerky pulls, and this time the sound of a woman's voice, raised high in anger, or pain, or both, came back to us small and clear through the sunlight. Out of the corner of one eye I could see Sir Basil nodding his head quietly up and down. "I got my fist caught in a jar of boiled sweets once," he said, "and I couldn't get it out." The man retreated a few yards, and was standing with hands on hips, head up, looking furious and sullen. The woman, from her uncomfortable position, appeared to be talking to him, or rather shouting at him, and although the body itself was pretty firmly fixed and could only wriggle, the legs were free and did a good deal of moving and stamping. "I broke the jar with a hammer and told my mother I'd knocked it off the shelf by mistake." He seemed calmer now, not tense at all, although his voice was curiously flat. "I suppose we'd better go down and see if we can help." "Perhaps we should." But still he didn't move. He took out a cigarette and lit it, putting the used match carefully back in the box. "I'm sorry," he said. "Will you have one?" "Thanks, I think I will." He made a little ceremony of giving me the cigarette and lighting it for me, and again he put the used match back in the box. Then we got up and walked slowly down the grass slope. We came upon them silently, through an archway in the yew hedge, and it was naturally quite a surprise. "What's the matter here?" Sir Basil asked. He spoke softly, with a dangerous softness that I'm sure his wife had never heard before. "She's gone and put her head through the hole and now she can't get it out," Major Haddock said. "Just for a lark, you know." "For a what?" "Basil!" Lady Turton shouted, "Don't be such a damn fool! Do something, can't you!" She may not have been able to move much, but she could still talk. "Pretty obvious we're going to have to break up this lump of wood," the Major said. There was a small smudge of red on his grey moustache, and this, like the single extra touch of colour that ruins a perfect painting, managed somehow to destroy all his manly looks. It made him comic. "You mean break the Henry Moore?" "My dear sir, there is no other way of setting the lady free. God knows how she managed to squeeze it in, but I know for a fact that she can't pull it out. It's the ears get in the way." "Oh dear," Sir Basil said. "What a terrible pity. My beautiful Henry Moore." At this stage Lady Turton began abusing her husband in a most unpleasant manner, and there's no knowing how long it would have gone on had not Jeiks suddenly appeared out of the shadows. He came sidling silently on to the lawn and stationed himself at a respectful distance from Sir Basil, as though awaiting instructions. His black clothes looked perfectly ridiculous in the morning sunlight, and with his ancient pink-white face and white hands he was like some small crabby animal that has lived all its life in a hole under the ground. "Is there anything I can do, Sir Basil?" He kept his voice level, but I didn't think his face was quite straight. When he looked at Lady Turton there was a little exulting glimmer in his eyes. "Yes Jelks, there is. Go back and get me a saw or something so I can cut out this section of wood." "Shall I call one of the men, Sir Basil? William is a good carpenter." "No, I'll do it myself. Just get the tools and hurry." While they were waiting for Jelks, I strolled away because I didn't want to hear any more of the things that Lady Turton was saying to her husband. But I was back in time to see the butler returning, followed now by the other woman, Carmen La Rosa, who made a rush for the hostess. "Nata-Ji-a! My dear Nata-li-a! What have they done to you?" "Oh shut up," the hostess said. "And get out of the way, will you." Sir Basil took up a position close to his lady's head, waiting for Jelks. Jeiks advanced slowly, carrying a saw in one hand, an axe in the other, and he stopped maybe a yard away. Then he held out both implements in front of him so his master could choose, and there was a brief moment--no more than two or three seconds--of silence, and of waiting, and it just happened that I was watching Jelks at this time. I saw the hand that was carrying the axe come forward an extra fraction of an inch towards Sir Basil. It was so slight a movement it was barely noticeable--a tiny pushing forward of the hand, slow and secret, a little offer, a little coaxing offer that was accompanied perhaps by an infinitesimal lift of the eyebrow. I'm not sure whether Sir Basil saw it, but be hesitated, and again the hand that held the axe came edging forward, and it was almost exactly like that card trick where the man says 'Take one, whichever one you want,' and you always get the one he means you to have. Sir Basil got the axe. I saw him reach out in a dreamy sort of way, accepting it from Jeiks, and then, the instant he felt the handle in his grasp he seemed to realize what was required of him and he sprang to life. For me, after that, it was like the awful moment when you see a child running out into the road and a car is coming and all you can do is shut your eyes tight and wait until the noise tells you it has happened. The moment of waiting becomes a long lucid period of time with yellow and red spots dancing on a black field, and even if you open your eyes again and find that nobody has been killed or hurt, it makes no difference because so far as you and your stomach were concerned you saw it all. I saw this one all right, every detail of it, and I didn't open my eyes again until I heard Sir Basil's voice, even softer than usual, calling in gentle protest to the butler. "Jeiks," he was saying, and I looked and saw him standing there as calm as you please, still holding the axe. Lady Turton's head was there too, still sticking through the hole, but her face had turned a terrible ashy grey, and the mouth was opening and shutting making a kind of gurgling sound. "Look here, Jeiks," Sir Basil was saying. "What on earth are you thinking about. This thing's much too dangerous. Give me the saw." And as he exchanged implements I noticed for the first time two little warm roses of colour appearing on his cheeks, and above them, all around the corners of his eyes, the twinkling tiny wrinkles of a smile.
The Story of the Great Weep  It was in the second decade of the Twentieth Century, after the Great Plague had devastated England, that Hermann the Irascible, nicknamed also the Wise, sat on the British throne. The Mortal Sickness had swept away the entire Royal Family, unto the third and fourth generations, and thus it came to pass that Hermann the Fourteenth of Saxe-Drachsen-Wachtelstein, who had stood thirtieth in the order of succession, found himself one day ruler of the British dominions within and beyond the seas. He was one of the unexpected things that happen in politics, and he happened with great thoroughness. In many ways he was the most progressive monarch who had sat on an important throne; before people knew where they were, they were somewhere else. Even his Ministers, progressive though they were by tradition, found it difficult to keep pace with his legislative suggestions.  "As a matter of fact," admitted the Prime Minister, "we are hampered by these votes-for-women creatures; they disturb our meetings throughout the country, and they try to turn Downing Street into a sort of political picnic-ground."  "They must be dealt with" said Hermann.  "Dealt with," said the Prime Minister; "exactly, just so; but how?"  "I will draft you a Bill," said the King, sitting down at his type-writing machine, "enacting that women shall vote at all future elections. Shall vote, you observe; or, to put it plainer, must. Voting will remain optional, as before, for male electors; but every woman between the ages of twenty-one and seventy will be obliged to vote, not only at elections for Parliament, county councils, district boards, parish-councils, and municipalities, but for coroners, school inspectors, churchwardens, curators of museums, sanitary authorities, police-court interpreters, swimming-bath instructors, contractors, choir-masters, market superintendents, art-school teachers, cathedral vergers, and other local functionaries whose names I will add as they occur to me. All these offices will become elective, and failure to vote at any election falling within her area of residence will involve the female elector in a penalty of 10 pounds. Absence, unsupported by an adequate medical certificate, will not be accepted as an excuse. Pass this Bill through the two Houses of Parliament and bring it to me for signature the day after tomorrow."  From the very outset the Compulsory Female Franchise produced little or no elation even in circles which had been loudest in demanding the vote. The bulk of the women of the country had been indifferent or hostile to the franchise agitation, and the most fanatical Suffragettes began to wonder what they had found so attractive in the prospect of putting ballot-papers into a box. In the country districts the task of carrying out the provisions of the new Act was irksome enough; in the towns and cities it became an incubus. There seemed no end to the elections. Laundresses and seamstresses had to hurry away from their work to vote, often for a candidate whose name they hadn't heard before, and whom they selected at haphazard; female clerks and waitresses got up extra early to get their voting done before starting off to their places of business. Society women found their arrangements impeded and upset by the continual necessity for attending the polling stations, and week-end parties and summer holidays became gradually a masculine luxury. As for Cairo and the Riviera, they were possible only for genuine invalids or people of enormous wealth, for the accumulation of 10 pound fines during a prolonged absence was a contingency that even ordinarily wealthy folk could hardly afford to risk.     It was not wonderful that the female disfranchisement agitation became a formidable movement. The No-Votes-for-Women League numbered its feminine adherents by the million; its colours, citron and old Dutch-madder, were flaunted everywhere, and its battle hymn, "We Don't Want to Vote," became a popular refrain. As the Government showed no signs of being impressed by peaceful persuasion, more violent methods came into vogue. Meetings were disturbed, Ministers were mobbed, policemen were bitten, and ordinary prison fare rejected, and on the eve of the anniversary of Trafalgar women bound themselves in tiers up the entire length of the Nelson column so that its customary floral decoration had to be abandoned. Still the Government obstinately adhered to its conviction that women ought to have the vote.  Then, as a last resort, some woman wit hit upon an expedient which it was strange that no one had thought of before. The Great Weep was organized. Relays of women, ten thousand at a time, wept continuously in the public places of the Metropolis. They wept in railway stations, in tubes and omnibuses, in the National Gallery, at the Army and Navy Stores, in St. James's Park, at ballad concerts, at Prince's and in the Burlington Arcade. The hitherto unbroken success of the brilliant farcical comedy "Henry's Rabbit" was imperilled by the presence of drearily weeping women in stalls and circle and gallery, and one of the brightest divorce cases that had been tried for many years was robbed of much of its sparkle by the lachrymose behaviour of a section of the audience.     "What are we to do?" asked the Prime Minister, whose cook had wept into all the breakfast dishes and whose nursemaid had gone out, crying quietly and miserably, to take the children for a walk in the Park.  "There is a time for everything," said the King; "there is a time to yield. Pass a measure through the two Houses depriving women of the right to vote, and bring it to me for the Royal assent the day after tomorrow."  As the Minister withdrew, Hermann the Irascible, who was also nicknamed the Wise, gave a profound chuckle.  "There are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with cream," he quoted, "but I'm not sure," he added "that it's not the best way."  
It was Mrs. Packletide's pleasure and intention that she should shoot a tiger. Not that the lust to kill had suddenly descended on her, or that she felt that she would leave India safer and more wholesome than she had found it, with one fraction less of wild beast per million of inhabitants. The compelling motive for her sudden deviation towards the footsteps of Nimrod was the fact that Loona Bimberton had recently been carried eleven miles in an aeroplane by an Algerian aviator, and talked of nothing else; only a personally procured tiger-skin and a heavy harvest of Press photographs could successfully counter that sort of thing. Mrs. Packletide had already arranged in her mind the lunch she would give at her house in Curzon Street, ostensibly in Loona Bimberton's honour, with a tiger-skin rug occupying most of the foreground and all of the conversation. She had also already designed in her mind the tiger-claw broach that she was going to give Loona Bimberton on her next birthday. In a world that is supposed to be chiefly swayed by hunger and by love Mrs. Packletide was an exception; her movements and motives were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.  Circumstances proved propitious. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without over-much risk or exertion, and it so happened that a neighbouring village could boast of being the favoured rendezvous of an animal of respectable antecedents, which had been driven by the increasing infirmities of age to abandon game-killing and confine its appetite to the smaller domestic animals. The prospect of earning the thousand rupees had stimulated the sporting and commercial instinct of the villagers; children were posted night and day on the outskirts of the local jungle to head the tiger back in the unlikely event of his attempting to roam away to fresh hunting-grounds, and the cheaper kinds of goats were left about with elaborate carelessness to keep him satisfied with his present quarters. The one great anxiety was lest he should die of old age before the date appointed for the memsahib's shoot. Mothers carrying their babies home through the jungle after the day's work in the fields hushed their singing lest they might curtail the restful sleep of the venerable herd-robber.  The great night duly arrived, moonlit and cloudless. A platform had been constructed in a comfortable and conveniently placed tree, and thereon crouched Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat, gifted with a particularly persistent bleat, such as even a partially deaf tiger might be reasonably expected to hear on a still night, was tethered at the correct distance. With an accurately sighted rifle and a thumb-nail pack of patience cards the sportswoman awaited the coming of the quarry.  ``I suppose we are in some danger?'' said Miss Mebbin.  She was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she had a morbid dread of performing an atom more service than she had been paid for.  ``Nonsense,'' said Mrs. Packletide; ``it's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.''  ``If it's an old tiger I think you ought to get it cheaper. A thousand rupees is a lot of money.''  Louisa Mebbin adopted a protective elder-sister attitude towards money in general, irrespective of nationality or denomination. Her energetic intervention had saved many a rouble from dissipating itself in tips in some Moscow hotel, and francs and centimes clung to her instinctively under circumstances which would have driven them headlong from less sympathetic hands. Her speculations as to the market depreciation of tiger remnants were cut short by the appearance on the scene of the animal itself. As soon as it caught sight of the tethered goat it lay flat on the earth, seemingly less from a desire to take advantage of all available cover than for the purpose of snatching a short rest before commencing the grand attack.     ``I believe it's ill,'' said Louisa Mebbin, loudly in Hindustani, for the benefit of the village headman, who was in ambush in a neighbouring tree.  ``Hush!'' said Mrs. Packletide, and at that moment the tiger commenced ambling towards his victim.  ``Now, now!'' urged Miss Mebbin with some excitement; ``if he doesn't touch the goat we needn't pay for it.'' (The bait was an extra.)  The rifle flashed out with a loud report, and the great tawny beast sprang to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited natives had swarmed on to the scene, and their shouting speedily carried the glad news to the village, where a thumping of tom-toms took up the chorus of triumph. And their triumph and rejoicing found a ready echo in the heart of Mrs. Packletide; already that luncheon-party in Curzon Street seemed immeasurably nearer.  It was Louisa Mebbin who drew attention to the fact that the goat was in death-throes from a mortal bullet-wound, while no trace of the rifle's deadly work could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the beast of prey had succumbed to heart-failure, caused by the sudden report of the rifle, accelerated by senile decay. Mrs. Packletide was pardonably annoyed at the discovery; but, at any rate, she was the possessor of a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly connived at the fiction that she had shot the beast. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore did Mrs. Packletide face the cameras with a light heart, and her pictured fame reached from the pages of the Texas Weekly Snapshot to the illustrated Monday supplement of the Novoe Vremya. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at an illustrated paper for weeks, and her letter of thanks for the gift of a tiger-claw brooch was a model of repressed emotions. The luncheon-party she declined; there are limits beyond which repressed emotions become dangerous.     From Curzon Street the tiger-skin rug travelled down to the Manor House, and was duly inspected and admired by the county, and it seemed a fitting and appropriate thing when Mrs. Packletide went to the County Costume Ball in the character of Diana. She refused to fall in, however, with Clovis's tempting suggestion of a primeval dance party, at which every one should wear the skins of beasts they had recently slain. ``I should be in rather a Baby Bunting condition,'' confessed Clovis, ``with a miserable rabbit-skin or two to wrap up in, but then,'' he added, with a rather malicious glance at Diana's proportions, ``my figure is quite as good as that Russian dancing boy's.''  ``How amused every one would be if they knew what really happened,'' said Louisa Mebbin a few days after the ball.  ``What do you mean?'' asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.  ``How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,'' said Miss Mebbin, with her disagreeably pleasant laugh.  ``No one would believe it,'' said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing colour as rapidly as though it were going through a book of patterns before post-time.  ``Loona Bimberton would,'' said Miss Mebbin. Mrs. Packletide's face settled on an unbecoming shade of greenish white.  ``You surely wouldn't give me away?'' she asked.  ``I've seen a week-end cottage near Darking that I should rather like to buy,'' said Miss Mebbin with seeming irrelevance. ``Six hundred and eighty, freehold. Quite a bargain, only I don't happen to have the money.''  *  Louisa Mebbin's pretty week-end cottage, christened by her ``Les Fauves,'' and gay in summer-time with its garden borders of tiger-lilies, is the wonder and admiration of her friends.  ``It is a marvel how Louisa manages to do it,'' is the general verdict.  Mrs. Packletide indulges in no more big-game shooting.  ``The incidental expenses are so heavy,'' she confides to inquiring friends.
We’d finished supper and I’d been at the kitchen table with the light out for the last hour, watching. If he was going to do it tonight, it was time, past time. I hadn’t seen him in three nights. But tonight the bedroom shade was up over there and the light burning.  I had a feeling tonight.  Then I saw him. He opened the screen and walked out onto his back porch wearing a T-shirt and something like Bermuda shorts or a swimsuit. He looked around once and hopped off the porch into the shadows and began to move along the side of the house. He was fast. If I hadn’t been watching, I wouldn’t have seen him. He stopped in front of the lighted window and looked in.  “Vern,” I called. “Vern, hurry up! He’s out there. You’d better hurry!”  Vern was in the living room reading his paper with the TV going. I heard him throw down the paper.  “Don’t let him see you!” Vern said. “Don’t get up too close to the window!”  Vern always says that: Don’t get up too close. Vern’s a little embarrassed about watching, I think. But I know he enjoys it. He’s said so.  “He can’t see us with the light out.” It’s what I always say. This has been going on for three months. Since September 3, to be exact. Anyway, that’s the first night I saw him over there. I don’t know how long it was going on before that.  I almost got on the phone to the sheriff that night, until I recognized who it was out there. It took Vern to explain it to me. Even then it took a while for it to penetrate. But since that night I’ve watched, and I can tell you he averages one out of every two or three nights, sometimes more. I’ve seen him out there when it’s been raining too. In fact, if it is raining, you can bet on seeing him. But tonight it was clear and windy. There was a moon.  We got down on our knees behind the window and Vern cleared his throat.  “Look at him,” Vern said. Vern was smoking, knocking the ash into his hand when he needed. He held the cigarette away from the window when he puffed. Vern smokes all the time; there’s no stopping him. He even sleeps with an ashtray three inches from his head. At night I’m awake and he wakes up and smokes.  “By God,” Vern said.  “What does she have that other women don’t have?” I said to Vern after a minute. We were hunkered on the floor with just our heads showing over the windowsill and were looking at a man who was standing and looking into his own bedroom window.  “That’s just it,” Vern said. He cleared his throat right next to my ear.  We kept watching.  I could make out someone behind the curtain now. It must have been her undressing. But I couldn’t see any detail. I strained my eyes. Vern was wearing his reading glasses, so he could see everything better than I could. Suddenly the curtain was drawn aside and the woman turned her back to the window.  “What’s she doing now?” I said, knowing full well.  “By God,” Vern said.  “What’s she doing, Vern?” I said.  “She’s taking off her clothes,” Vern said. “What do you think she’s doing?”  Then the bedroom light went out and the man started back along the side of his house. He opened the screen door and slipped inside, and a little later the rest of the lights went out.  Vern coughed, coughed again, and shook his head. I turned on the light. Vern just sat there on his knees. Then he got to his feet and lighted a cigarette.  “Someday I’m going to tell that trash what I think of her,” I said and looked at Vern.  Vern laughed sort of.  “I mean it,” I said. “I’ll see her in the market someday and I’ll tell her to her face.”  “I wouldn’t do that. What the hell would you do that for?” Vern said.  But I could tell he didn’t think I was serious. He frowned and looked at his nails. He rolled his tongue in his mouth and narrowed his eyes like he does when he’s concentrating. Then his expression changed and he scratched his chin. “You wouldn’t do anything like that,” he said.  “You’ll see,” I said.  “Shit,” Vern said.  I followed him into the living room. We were jumpy. It gets us like that.  “You wait,” I said.  Vern ground his cigarette out in the big ashtray. He stood beside his leather chair and looked at the TV a minute.  “There’s never anything on,” he said. Then he said something else. He said, “Maybe he has something there.” Vern lighted another cigarette. “You don’t know.”  “Anybody comes looking in my window,” I said, “they’ll have the cops on them. Except maybe Cary Grant,” I said.  Vern shrugged. “You don’t know,” he said.  I had an appetite. I went to the kitchen cupboard and looked, and then I opened the fridge.  “Vern, you want something to eat?” I called.  He didn’t answer. I could hear water running in the bathroom. But I thought he might want something. We get hungry this time of night. I put bread and lunchmeat on the table and I opened a can of soup. I got out crackers and peanut butter, cold meat loaf, pickles, olives, potato chips. I put everything on the table. Then I thought of the apple pie.  Vern came out in his robe and flannel pajamas. His hair was wet and slicked down over the back of his head, and he smelled of toilet water. He looked at the things on the table. He said, “What about a bowl of corn flakes with brown sugar?” Then he sat down and spread his paper out to the side of his plate.  We ate our snack. The ashtray filled up with olive pits and his butts.  When he’d finished, Vern grinned and said, “What’s that good smell?”  I went to the oven and took out the two pieces of apple pie topped with melted cheese.  “That looks fine,” Vern said.  In a little while, he said. “I can’t eat any more. I’m going to bed.”  “I’m coming too,” I said. “I’ll clear this table.”  I was scraping plates into the garbage can when I saw the ants. I looked closer. They came from somewhere beneath the pipes under the sink, a steady stream of them, up one side of the can and down the other, coming and going. I found the spray in one of the drawers and sprayed the outside and the inside of the garbage can, and I sprayed as far back under the sink as I could reach. Then I washed my hands and took a last look around the kitchen.  Vern was asleep. He was snoring. He’d wake up in a few hours, go to the bathroom, and smoke. The little TV at the foot of the bed was on, but the picture was rolling.  I’d wanted to tell Vern about the ants.  I took my own time getting ready for bed, fixed the picture, and crawled in. Vern made the noises he does in his sleep.  I watched for a while, but it was a talk show and I don’t like talk shows. I started thinking about the ants again.  Pretty soon I imagined them all over the house. I wondered if I should wake Vern and tell him I was having a bad dream. Instead, I got up and went for the can of spray. I looked under the sink again. But there was no ants left. I turned on every light in the house until I had the house blazing.  I kept spraying.  Finally I raised the shade in the kitchen and looked out. It was late. The wind blew and I heard branches snap.  “That trash,” I said. “The idea!”  I used even worse language, things I can’t repeat.
My husband eats with a good appetite. But I don’t think he’s really hungry. He chews, arms on the table, and stares at something across the room. He looks at me and looks away. He wipes his mouth on the napkin. He shrugs, and goes on eating.  "What are you staring at me for?" he says. "What is it?" he says and lays down his fork.  "Was I staring?" I say, and shake my head. The telephone rings.  "Don’t answer it," he says.  "It might be your mother," I say.  "Watch and see," he says.  I pick up the receiver and listen. My husband stops eating.  "What did I tell you?" he says when I hang up. He starts to eat again. Then throws his napkin on his plate. He says, "Goddamn it, why can’t people mind their own business? Tell me what I did wrong and I’ll listen! I wasn’t the only man there. We talked it over and we all decided. We couldn’t just turn around. We were five miles from the car. I won’t have you passing judgment. Do you hear?"  "You know," I say.  He says, "What do I know, Claire? Tell me what I’m supposed to know. I don’t know anything except one thing?’ He gives me what he thinks is a meaningful look. "She was dead," he says. "And I’m as sorry as anyone else. But she was dead."  "That’s the point," I say.  He raises his hands. He pushes his chair away from the table. He takes out his cigarettes and goes out to the back with a can of beer. ~ see him sit in the lawn chair and pick up the newspaper again.  His name is in there on the first page. Along with the names of his friends.  I close my eyes and hold on to the sink. Then I rake my arm across the drainboard and send the dishes to the floor.  He doesn’t move. I know he’s heard. He lifts his head as if still listening. But he doesn’t move otherwise. He doesn’t turn around.  He and Gordon Johnson and Mel Dorn and Vern Williams, they play poker and bowl and fish. They fish every spring and early summer before visiting relatives can get in the way. They are decent men, family men, men who take care of their jobs. They have sons and daughters who go to school with our son, Dean.  Last Friday these family men left for the Naches River. They parked the car in the mountains and hiked to where they wanted to fish. They carried their bedrolls, their food, their playing cards, their whiskey.  They saw the girl before they set up camp. Mel Dorn found her. No clothes on her at all. She was wedged into some branches that stuck out over the water.  He called the others and they came to look. They talked about what to do. One of the men-my Stuart didn’t say which-said they should start back at once. The others stirred the sand with their shoes, said they didn’t feel inclined that way. They pleaded fatigue, the late hour, the fact that the girl wasn’t going anywhere.  In the end they went ahead and set up the camp. They built a fire and drank their whiskey. When the moon came up, they talked about the girl. Someone said they should -keep the body from drifting away. They took their flashlights and went back to the river. One of the men-it might have been Stuart-waded in and got her. He took her by the fingers and pulled her into shore. He got some nylon cord and tied it to her wrist and then looped the rest around a tree.  The next morning they cooked breakfast, drank coffee, and drank whiskey, and then split up to fish. That night they cooked fish, cooked potatoes, drank coffee, drank whiskey, then took their cooking things and eating things back down to the river and washed them where the girl was.  They played some cards later on. Maybe they played until they couldn’t see them anymore. Vern Williams went to sleep. But the others told stories. Gordon Johnson said the trout they’d caught were hard because of the terrible coldness of the water.  The next morning they got up late, drank whiskey, fished a little, took down their tents, rolled their sleeping bags, gathered their stuff, and hiked out. They drove until they got to a telephone. It was Stuart who made the call while the others stood around in the sun and listened. He gave the sheriff their names. They had nothing to hide. They weren’t ashamed. They said they’d wait until someone could come for better directions and take down their statements.  I was asleep when he got home. But I woke up when I heard him in the kitchen. I found him leaning against the refrigerator with a can of beer. He put his heavy arms around me and rubbed his big hands on my back. In bed he put his hands on me again and then waited as if thinking of something else. I turned and opened my legs. Afterwards, I think he stayed awake.  He was up that morning before I could get out of bed. To see if there was something in the paper, I suppose.  The telephone began ringing right after eight.  "Go to hell!" I heard him shout.  The telephone rang right again.  "I have nothing to add to what sherirn"  He slammed the receiver down.  "What is going on?" I said.  It was then that he told me what I just told you.  I sweep up the broken dishes and go outside. He is lying on his back on the grass now, the newspaper and can of beer within reach.  "Stuart, could we go for a drive?" I say.  He rolls over and looks at me. "We’ll pick up some beer," he says.. He gets to his feet and touches me on the hip as he goes past. "Give me a minute," he says.  We drive through town without speaking. He stops at a roadside market for beer. I notice a great stack ofpapersjust inside the door. On the top step a fat woman in a print dress holds out a licorice stick to a little girl. Later on, we cross Everson Creek and turn into the picnic grounds. The creek runs under the bridge and into a large pond a few hundred yards away. I can see the men out there. I can see them out there fishing.  So much water so close to home.  1 say, "Why did you have to go miles away?"  "Don’t rile me," he says.  We sit on a bench in the sun. He opens us cans of beer. He says, "Relax, Claire."  "They said they were innocent. They said they were crazy."  He says, "Who?" He says, "What are you talking about?"  "The Maddox brothers. They killed a girl named Arlene Hubly where I grew up. They cut off her head and threw her into the Cle Elum River. It happened when I was a girl."  "You’re going to get me riled," he says.  I look at the creek. I’m right in it, eyes open, face down, staring at the moss on the bottom, dead.  "I don’t know what’s wrong with you," he says on the way home. "You’re getting me more riled by the minute."  There is nothing I can say to him.  He tries to concentrate on the road. But he keeps looking into the rear-view mirror.  He knows.  Stuart believes he is letting me sleep this morning. But I was awake long before the alarm went off. I was thinking, lying on the far side of the bed away from his hairy legs.  He gets Dean off for school, and then he shaves, dresses, and leaves for work. Twice he looks in and clears his throat. But I keep my eyes closed.  In the kitchen I find a note from him. It’s signed "Love." I sit in the breakfast nook and drink coffee and leave a ring on the note. I look at the newspaper and turn it this way and that on the table. Then I skid it close and read what it says. The body has been identified, claimed. But it took some examining it, some putting things into it, some cutting, some weighing, some measuring, some putting things back again and sewing them in.  I sit for a long time holding the newspaper and thinking. Then I call up to get a chair at the hairdresser’s.  I sit under the dryer with a magazine on my lap and let Marnie do my nails.  "I am going to a funeral tomorrow," I say. "I’m sorry to hear that," Marnie says. "It was a murder," I say.  "That’s the worst kind," Marnie says.  "We weren’t all that close," I say. "But you know?’  "We’ll get you fixed up for it," Marnie says.  That night I make my bed on the sofa, and in the morning I get up first. I put on coffee and fix breakfast while he shaves.  He appears in the kitchen doorway, towel over his bare shoulder, appraising.  "Here’s coffee," I say. "Eggs’ll be ready in a minute?’  I wake Dean, and the three of us eat. Whenever Stuart looks at me, I ask Dean if he wants more milk, more toast, etc.  "I’ll call you today," Stuart says as he opens the door.  I say, "I don’t think I’ll be home today."  "All right," he says. "Sure."  I dress carefully. I try on a hat and look at myself in the mirror. I write out a note for Dean.  Honey, Mommy has things to do this afternoon, but will be back later. You stay in or be in the backyard until one of us comes home.  Love, Mommy  I look at the word Love and then I underline it. Then I see the word backyard. Is it one word or two?  I D R I V E through farm country, through fields of oats and sugar beets and past apple orchards, cattle grazing in pastures. Then everything changes, more like shacks than farmhouses and stands of timber instead of orchards. Then mountains, and on the right, far below, I sometimes see the Naches River.  A green pickup comes up behind me and stays behind me for miles. I keep slowing at the wrong times, hoping he will pass. Then I speed up. But this is at the wrong times, too. I grip the wheel until my fingers hurt.  On a long clear stretch he goes past. But he drives along beside for a bit, a crewcut man in a blue workshirt. We look each other over. Then he waves, toots his horn, and pulls on up ahead.  I slow down and find a place. I pull over and shut offthe motor. I can hear the river down below the trees. Then I hear the pickup coming back.  I lock the doors and roll up the windows.  "You all right?" the man says. He raps on the glass. "You okay?" He leans his arms on the door and brings his face to the window.  I stare at him. I can’t think what else to do.  "Is everything all right in there? How come you’re all locked up?"  I shake my head.  "Roll down your window?’ He shakes his head and looks at the highway and then back at me. "Roll it down now."  "Please," I say, "I have to go."  "Open the door," he says as if he isn’t listening. "You’re going to choke in there."  He looks at my breasts, my legs. I can tell that’s what he’s doing.  "Hey, sugar," he says. "I’m just here to help is all."  The casket is closed and covered with floral sprays. The organ starts up the minute I take a seat. People are coming in and finding chairs. There’s a boy in flared pants and a yellow short-sleeved shirt. A door opens and the family comes in in a group and moves over to a curtained place off to one side. Chairs creak as everybody gets settled. Directly, a nice blond man in a nice dark suit stands and asks us to bow our heads. He says a prayer for us, the living, and when he finishes, he says a prayer for the soul of the departed.  Along with the others I go past the casket. Then I move out onto the front steps and into the afternoon light. There’s a woman who limps as she goes down the stairs ahead of me. On the sidewalk she looks around. "Well, they got him," she says. "If that’s any consolation. They arrested him this morning. I heard it on the radio before I come. A boy right here in town."  We move a few steps down the hot sidewalk. People are starting cars. I put out my hand and hold on to a parking meter. Polished hoods and polished fenders. My head swims.  I say, "They have friends, these killers. You can’t tell."  "I have known that child since she was a little girl," the woman says. "She used to come over and I’d bake cookies for her and let her eat them in front of the TV."  Back home, Stuart sits at the table with a drink of whiskey in front of him. For a crazy instant I think something’s happened to Dean.  "Where is he?" I say. "Where is Dean?"  "Outside," my husband says.  He drains his glass and stands up. He says, "I think I know what you need."  He reaches an arm around my waist and with his other hand he begins to unbutton my jacket and then he goes on to the buttons of my blouse.  "First things first," he says.  He says something else. But I don’t need to listen. I can’t hear a thing with so much water going.  "That’s right," I say, finishing the buttons myself, "Before Dean comes. Hurry?"
I sat in my office, nursing a glass of hooch and idly cleaning my automatic. Outside the rain fell steadily, like it seems to do most of the time in our fair city, whatever the tourist board says. Hell, I didn't care. I'm not on the tourist board. I'm a private dick, and one of the best, although you wouldn't have known it; the office was crumbling, the rent was unpaid and the hooch was my last.  Things are tough all over.  To cap it all the only client I'd had all week never showed up on the street corner where I'd waited for him. He said it was going to be a big job, but now I'd never know: he kept a prior appointment in the morgue.  So when the dame walked into my office I was sure my luck had changed for the better.  "What are you selling, lady?"  She gave me a look that would have induced heavy breathing in a pumpkin, and which shot my heartbeat up to three figures. She had long blonde hair and a figure that would have made Thomas Aquinas forget his vows. I forgot all mine about never taking cases from dames.  "What would you say to some of the green stuff?" she asked, in a husky voice, getting straight to the point.  "Continue, sister." I didn't want her to know how bad I needed the dough, so I held my hand in front of my mouth; it doesn't help if a client sees you salivate.  She opened her purse and flipped out a photograph. Glossy eight by ten. "Do you recognise that man?"  In my business you know who people are. "Yeah."  "He's dead."  "I know that too, sweetheart. It's old news. It was an accident."  Her gaze went so icy you could have chipped it into cubes and cooled a cocktail with it. "My brother's death was no accident."  I raised an eyebrow - you need a lot of arcane skills in my business - and said "Your brother, eh?" Funny, she hadn't struck me as the type that had brothers.  "I'm Jill Dumpty."  "So your brother was Humpty Dumpty?"  "And he didn't fall off that wall, Mr Horner. He was pushed."  Interesting, if true. Dumpty had his finger in most of the crooked pies in town; I could think of five guys who would have preferred to see him dead than alive without trying.  Without trying too hard, anyway.  "You seen the cops about this?"  "Nah. The King's Men aren't interested in anything to do with his death. They say they did all they could do in trying to put him together again after the fall."  I leaned back in my chair.  "So what's it to you. Why do you need me?"  "I want you to find the killer, Mr. Horner. I want him brought to justice. I want him to fry like an egg. Oh - and one other little thing," she added, lightly. "Before he died Humpty had a small manila envelope full of photographs he was meant to be sending me. Medical photos. I'm a trainee nurse, and I need them to pass my finals."  I inspected my nails, then looked up at her face, taking in a handful of waist and Easter-egg bazonkas on the way up. She was a looker, although her cute nose was a little on the shiny side. "I'll take the case. Seventy-five a day and two hundred bonus for results."  She smiled; my stomach twisted around once and went into orbit. "You get another two hundred if you get me those photographs. I want to be a nurse real bad." Then she dropped three fifties on my desk-top.  I let a devil-may-care grin play across my rugged face. "Say, sister, how about letting me take you out for dinner? I just came into some money."  She gave an involuntary shiver of anticipation and muttered something about having a thing about midgets, so I knew I was onto a good thing. Then she gave me a lopsided smile that would have made Albert Einstein drop a decimal point. "First find my brother's killer, Mr. Horner. And my photographs. Then we can play."  She closed the door behind her. Maybe it was still raining but I didn't notice. I didn't care.     There are parts of town the tourist board don't mention. Parts of town where the police travel in threes if they travel at all. In my line of work you get to visit them more than is healthy. Healthy is never.  He was waiting for me outside Luigi's. I slid up behind him, my rubber-soled shoes soundless on the shiny wet sidewalk.  "Hiya, Cock"  He jumped and spun around; I found myself gazing up into the muzzle of a .45. "Oh, Horner." He put the gun away. "Don't call me Cock. I'm Bernie Robin to you, Short-stuff, and don't you forget it."  `Cock Robin is good enough for me, Cock. Who killed Humpty Dumpty?"  He was a strange looking bird, but you can't be choosy in my profession. He was the best underworld lead I had.  "Let's see the colour of your money."  I showed him a fifty.  "Hell," he muttered. "It's green. Why can't they make puce or mauve money for a change?" He took it though. "All I know is that the Fat Man had his finger in a lot of pies."  "So?"  "One of those pies had four and twenty blackbirds in it."  "Huh?"  "Do I hafta spell it out for you? I... Ughh..." He crumpled to the sidewalk, an arrow protruding from his back. Cock Robin wasn't going to be doing any more chirping.     Sergeant O'Grady looked down at the body, then he looked down at me. "Faith and begorrah, to be sure" he said. "If it isn't Little Jack Horner himself."  "I didn't kill Cock Robin, Sarge."  "And I suppose that the call we got down at the station telling us you were going to be rubbing the late Mr. Robin out. Here. Tonight. Was just a hoax?"  "If I'm the killer, where are my arrows?' I thumbed open a pack of gum and started to chew. "It's a frame."  He puffed on his meerschaum and then put it away, and idly played a couple of phrases of the William Tell overture on his oboe. "Maybe. Maybe not. But you're still a suspect. Don't leave town. And Horner..."  "Yeah?"  "Dumpty's death was an accident. That's what the coroner said. That's what I say. Drop the case."  I thought about it. Then I thought of the money, and the girl. "No dice, Sarge."  He shrugged. "It's your funeral." He said it like it probably would be.  I had a funny feeling like he could be right.  "You're out of your depth, Horner. You're playing with the big boys. And it ain't healthy."  From what I could remember of my schooldays he was correct. Whenever I played with the big boys I always wound up having the stuffing beaten out of me. But how did O'Grady - how could O'Grady have known that? Then I remembered something else.  O'Grady was the one that used to beat me up the most.     It was time for what we in the profession call 'legwork'.I made a few discreet enquiries around town, but found out nothing about Dumpty that I didn't know already.  Humpty Dumpty was a bad egg. I remembered him when he was new in town, a smart young animal trainer with a nice line in training mice to run up clocks. He went to the bad pretty fast though; gambling, drink, women, it's the same story all over. A bright young kid thinks that the streets of Nurseryland are paved with gold, and by the time he finds out otherwise it's much too late.  Dumpty started off with extortions and robbery on a small scale - he trained up a team of spiders to scare little girls away from their curds and whey, which he'd pick up and sell on the black market. Then he moved onto blackmail -- the nastiest game. We crossed paths once, when I was hired by this young society kid - let's call him Georgie Porgie - to recover some compromising snaps of him kissing the girls and making them cry. I got the snaps, but I learned it wasn't healthy to mess with the Fat Man. And I don't make the same mistakes twice. Hell, in my line of work I can't afford to make the same mistakes once.  It's a tough world out there. I remember when Little Bo Peep first came to town... but you don't want to hear my troubles. If you're not dead yet, you've got troubles of your own.  I checked out the newspaper files on Dumpty's death. One minute he was sitting on a wall, the next he was in pieces at the bottom. All the King's Horses and all the King's Men were on the scene in minutes, but he needed more than first aid. A medic named Foster was called - a friend of Dumpty's from his Gloucester days - although I don't know of anything a doc can do when you're dead.  Hang on a second - Dr. Foster!  I got that old feeling you get in my line of work. Two little brain cells rub together the right way and in seconds you've got a 24 carat cerebral fire on your hands.  You remember the client who didn't show - the one I'd waited for all day on the street corner? An accidental death. I hadn't bothered to check it out - I can't afford to waste time on clients who aren't going to pay for it.  Three deaths, it seemed. Not one.  I reached for the telephone and rang the police station. "This is Horner," I told the desk man. "Lemme speak to Sergeant O'Grady."  There was a crackling and he came on the line. "O'Grady speaking."  "It's Horner."  "Hi, Little Jack." That was just like O'Grady. He'd been kidding me about my size since we were kids together. "You finally figured out that Dumpty's death was accidental?"  "Nope. I'm now investigating three deaths. The Fat Man's, Bernie Robin's and Dr. Foster's."  "Foster the plastic surgeon? His death was an accident."  "Sure. And your mother was married to your father."  There was a pause. "Horner, if you phoned me up just to talk dirty, I'm not amused."  "Okay, wise guy. If Humpty Dumpty's death was an accident and so was Dr. Foster's, tell me just one thing.  "Who killed Cock Robin?" I don't ever get accused of having too much imagination, but there's one thing I'd swear to. I could hear him grinning over the phone as he said : "You did, Horner. And I'm staking my badge on it."  The line went dead.     My office was cold and lonely, so I wandered down to Joe's Bar for some companionship and a drink or three.  Four and twenty blackbirds. A dead Doctor. The Fat Man. Cock Robin... Heck, this case had more holes in it than a Swiss cheese and more loose ends than a torn string vest. And where did the juicy Miss Dumpty come into it? Jack and Jill - we'd make a great team. When this was all over perhaps we could go off together to Louie's little place on the hill, where no-one's interested in whether you got a marriage license or not. 'The Pail of Water', that was the name of the joint.  I called over the bartender. "Hey. Joe."  "Yeah, Mr. Horner?" He was polishing a glass with a rag that had seen better days as a shirt.  "Did you ever meet the Fat Man's sister?"  He scratched at his cheek. "Can't say as I did. His sister...huh? Hey -- the Fat Man didn't have a sister."  "You sure of that?"  "Sure I'm sure. It was the day my sister had her first kid - I told the Fat Man I was an uncle. He gave me this look and says, 'Ain't no way I'll ever be an uncle, Joe. Got no sisters or brother, nor no other kinfolk neither."  If the mysterious Miss Dumpty wasn't his sister, who was she?  "Tell me, Joe. Didja ever see him in here with a dame - about so high, shaped like this?" My hands described a couple of parabolas. "Looks like a blonde love goddess."  He shook his head. "Never saw him with any dames. Recently he was hanging around with some medical guy, but the only thing he ever cared about was those crazy birds and animals of his."  I took a swig of my drink. It nearly took the roof of my mouth off. "Animals? I thought he'd given all that up."  "Naw - couple weeks back he was in here with a whole bunch of blackbirds he was training to sing 'Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before Mmm Mmm.'"  "Mmm Mmm?"  "Yeah. I got no idea who."  I put my drink down. A little of it spilt on the counter, and watched it strip the paint. "Thanks, Joe. You've been a big help." I handed him a ten dollar bill. "For information received,' I said, adding, "Don't spend it all at once"  In my profession it's making little jokes like that that keeps you sane.     I had one contact left. Ma Hubbard. I found a pay phone and called her number.  "Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard - Cake Shop and licensed Soup Kitchen."  "It's Horner, Ma."  "Jack? It ain't safe for me to talk to you."  "For old time's sake, sweetheart. You owe me a favour." Some two-bit crooks had once knocked off the Cupboard, leaving it bare. I'd tacked them down and returned the cakes and soup.  "...Okay. But I don't like it."  "You know everything that goes on around here on the food front, Ma. What's the significance of a pie with four and twenty trained blackbirds in it?" She whistled, long and low. "You really don't know?"  "I wouldn't be asking you if I did."  "You should read the Court pages of the papers next time, sugar. Jeez. You are out of your depth."  "C'mon, Ma. Spill it."  "It so happens that that particular dish was set before the King a few weeks back .... Jack? Are you still there?"  "I'm still here ma'am." I said, quietly. " All of a sudden a lot of things are starting to make sense." I put down the phone.  It was beginning to look like Little Jack Horner had pulled out a plum from this pie.  It was raining, steady and cold. I phoned a cab.  Quarter of an hour later one lurched out of the darkness.  "You're late."  "So complain to the tourist board."  I climbed in the back, wound down the window, and lit a cigarette.  And I went to see the Queen.     The door to the private part of the palace was locked. It's the part that the public don't get to see. But I've never been public, and the little lock hardly slowed me up. The door to the private apartments with the big red heart on it was unlocked, so I knocked and walked straight in.  The Queen of Hearts was alone, standing in front of the mirror, holding a plate of jam tarts with one hand, powdering her nose with the other. She turned, saw me, and gasped, dropping the tarts.  "Hey, Queenie," I said. "Or would you feel more comfortable if I called you Jill?"  She was still a good looking slice of dame, even without the blonde wig.  "Get out of here!" she hissed.  "I don't think so, toots." I sat down on the bed. "Let me spell a few things out for you."  "Go ahead." She reached behind her for a concealed alarm button. I let her press it. I'd cut the wires on my way in - in my profession there's no such thing as being too careful.  "Let me spell a few things out for you."  "You just said that."  "I'll tell this my way, lady."  I lit a cigarette and a thin plume of blue smoke drifted heavenwards, which was where I was going if my hunch was wrong. Still, I've learned to trust hunches.  "Try this on for size, Dumpty - the Fat Man - wasn't your brother. He wasn't even your friend. In fact he was blackmailing you. He knew about your nose."  She turned whiter than a number of corpses I've met in my time in the business. Her hand reached up and cradled her freshly powdered nose.  "You see, I've known the Fat Man for many years, and many years ago he had a lucrative concern in training animals and birds to do certain unsavoury things. And that got me to thinking... I had a client recently who didn't show, due to his having been stiffed first. Doctor Foster, of Gloucester, the plastic surgeon. The official version of his death was that he'd just sat too close to a fire and melted.  "But just suppose he was killed to stop him telling something that he knew? I put two and two together and hit the jackpot. Let me reconstruct a scene for you: You were out in the garden - probably hanging out some clothes - when along came one of Dumpty's trained pie-blackbirds and pecked off your nose.  "So there you were, standing in the garden, your hand in front of your face, when along comes the Fat Man with an offer you couldn't refuse. He could introduce you to a plastic surgeon who could fix you up with a nose as good as new, for a price. And no-one need ever know. Am I right so far?"  She nodded dumbly, then finding her voice, muttered : "Pretty much. But I ran back into the parlour after the attack, to eat some bread and honey. That was where he found me."  "Fair enough." The colour was starting to come back into her cheeks now. "So you had the operation from Foster, and no-one was going to be any the wiser. Until Dumpty told you that he had photos of the op. You had to get rid of him. A couple of days later you were out walking in the palace grounds. There was Humpty, sitting on a wall, his back to you, gazing out into the distance. In a fit of madness, you pushed. And Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.  "But now you were in big trouble. Nobody suspected you of his murder, but where were the photographs? Foster didn't have them, although he smelled a rat and had to be disposed of -- before he could see me. But you didn't know how much he'd told me, and you still didn't have the snapshots, so you took me on to find out. And that was your mistake, sister."  Her lower lip trembled, and my heart quivered. "You won't turn me in, will you?"  "Sister, you tried to frame me this afternoon. I don't take kindly to that."  With a shaking hand she started to unbutton her blouse. "Perhaps we could come to some sort of arrangement?"  I shook my head. "Sorry, your majesty. Mrs. Horner's little boy Jack was always taught to keep his hands off royalty. It's a pity, but that's how it is." To be on the safe side I looked away, which was a mistake. A cute little ladies' pistol was in her hands and pointing at me before you could sing a song of sixpence. The shooter may have been small, but I knew it packed enough of a wallop to take me out of the game permanently.  This dame was lethal.  "Put that gun down, your majesty." Sergeant O'Grady strolled through the bedroom door, his police special clutched in his ham-like fist.  "I'm sorry I suspected you, Horner," he said drily. "You're lucky I did, though, sure and begorrah. I had you trailed here and I overheard the whole thing."  "Hi, Sarge, thanks for stopping by. But I hadn't finished my explanation. If you'll take a seat I'll wrap it up."  He nodded brusquely, and sat down near the door. His gun hardly moved.  I got up from the bed and walked over to the Queen. "You see, Toots, what I didn't tell you was who did have the snaps of your nose job. Humpty did, when you killed him."  A charming frown crinkled her perfect brow. "I don't understand... I had the body searched."  "Sure, afterwards. But the first people to get to the Fat Man were the King's Men. The cops. And one of them pocketed the envelope. When any fuss had died down the blackmail would have started again. Only this time you wouldn't have known who to kill. And I owe you an apology." I bent down to tie my shoelaces.  "Why?"  "I accused you of trying to frame me this afternoon. You didn't. That arrow was the property of a boy who was the best archer in my school - I should have recognised that distinctive fletching anywhere. Isn't that right," I said, turning back to the door, "...'Sparrow' O'Grady?"  Under the guise of tying up my shoelaces I had already palmed a couple of the Queen's jam tarts, and, flinging one of them upwards, I neatly smashed the room's only light bulb.  It only delayed the shooting a few seconds, but a few seconds was all I needed, and as the Queen of Hearts and Sergeant 'Sparrow' O'Grady cheerfully shot each other to bits, I split.  In my business, you have to look after number one.  Munching on a jam tart I walked out of the palace grounds and into the street. I paused by a trash-can, to try to burn the manilla envelope of photographs I had pulled from O'Grady's pocket as I walked past him, but it was raining so hard they wouldn't catch.  When I got back to my office I phoned the tourist board to complain. They said the rain was good for the farmers, and I told them what they could do with it.  They said that things are tough all over.  And I said. Yeah.
O my Beauty Boy - reading Plato so divine! O, dark, oh fair, colored golf champion of Chicago. Over the rails he goes at night, steward of the club car, and afterwards in the dim smoke by the one light and the smell of stale spittoons, writing west to the Rosecrucian Brotherhood. Seeking ever.  O Beauty Boy here is your girl, not one to soar like you, but a clean swift serpent who will travel as fast on land and look toward you in the sky.  Lilymary loved him, oft invited him and they were married in St. Jarvis' church in North Englewood. For years they bettered themselves, running along the tread-mill of their reach, becoming only a little older and no better than before. He was loaned the Communist Manifesto by the wife of the advertising manager of a Chicago Daily but for preference give him Plato - the Phaedo and the Apologia, or else the Rosecrucian Brotherhood of Sacramento, California, which burned in his ears as the rails clicked past Alton, Springfield Burlington in the dark.  Bronze lovers, never never canst thou have thy bronze child - or so it seemed for years. Then the clock struck, the gong rang and Dr. Edwin Bruch of South Michigan Avenue agreed to handle the whole thing for $200. They looked so nice - so delicately nice, neither of them over hurting the other and graciously expert in the avoidance. Beauty Boy took fine care of her in her pregnancy - paid his sister to watch with her while he did double work on the road and served for caterers in the city; and one day the bronze baby was born.  O Beauty Boy, Lilymary said, here is your beauty boy. She lay in a four bed ward in the hospital with the wives of a prize fighter, an undertaker and a doctor. Beauty Boy's face was so twisted with radiance; his teeth shining so in his smile and his eyes so kind that it seemed that nothing and nothing could ever.  Beauty Boy sad beside her bed when she slept and read Thoreau's Walden for the third time. Then the nurse told him he must leave. He went on the road that night and in Alton going to mail her a letter for a passenger he slipped under the moving train and his leg was off above the knee.  Beauty Boy lay in the hospital and a year passed. Lilymary went back to work again cooking. Things were tough, there was even trouble about his workman's compensation, but he found lines in his books that helped them along for awhile when all the human beings seemed away.  The little baby flourished but he was not beautiful like his parents; not as they had expected in those golden dreams. They had only spare-time love to give the child so the sister more and more and more took care of him. For they wanted to get back where they were, they wanted Beauty Boy's leg to grow again so it would all be like it was before. So that he could find delight in his books again and Lilymary could find delight in hoping for a little baby.  Some years passed. They were so far back on the treadmill that they would never catch up. Beauty Boy was a night-watchman now but he had six operations on his stump and each new artificial limb gave him constant pain. Lilymary worked fairly steadily as a cook. Now they had become just ordinary people. Even the sister had long since forgotten that Beauty Boy was formerly colored golf champion of Chicago. Once in cleaning the closet she threw out all his books - the Apologia and the Phaedo of Plate, and the Thoreau and the Emerson and all the leaflets and correspondence with the Roosecrucian Brotherhood. He didn't find out for a long time that they were gone. And then he just stared at the place where they had been and said "Say, man...say man."  For things change and get so different that we can hardly recognize them and it seems that only our names remain the same. It seemed wrong for them still to call each other Beauty Boy and Lilymary long after the delight was over.  Some years later they both died in an influenza epidemic and went to heaven. They thought it was going to be all right then - indeed things began to happen in exactly the way that they had been told as children. Beauty Boy's leg grew again and he became golf champion of all heaven, both white and black, and drove the ball powerfully from cloud to cloud through the blue fairway. Lilymary's breasts became young and firm, she was respected among the other angels, and her pride n Beauty Boy became as it had been before.  In the evening they sat and tried to remember what it was they missed. It was not this Hobbs, for here everyone knew all those things by heart, and it was not the little boy for he had never really been on e of them. They couldn't remember so after a puzzled time they would give up trying, and talk about how nice the other one was, of how fine a score Beauty Boy would make tomorrow.  So things go.
Every night that winter he said aloud into the dark of the pillow: Half-past four! Half past-four! till he felt his brain had gripped the words and held them fast. Them he fell asleep at once, as if a shutter had fallen; and lay with his face turned to the clock so that he could see it first thing when he woke.  It was half-past four to the minute, every morning. Triumphantly pressing down the alarm knob of the clock, which the dark half of his mind had outwitted, remaining vigilant all night and counting the hours as he lay relaxed in sleep, he huddled down for a last warm moment under the clothes, playing with the idea of lying abed for this once only. But he played with it for the fun of knowing that it was a weakness he could defeat without effort; just as he set the alarm each night for the delight of the moment when he woke and stretched his limbs, feeling the muscles tighten, and thought: Even my brain--even that! I can control every part of myself.  Luxury of warm rested body, with the arms and legs and fingers waiting like soldiers for a word of command! Joy of knowing that the precious hours were given to sleep voluntarily! -for he had once stayed awake three nights running, to prove that he could, and them worked all day, refusing even to admit that he was tired; and now sleep seemed to him a servant to be commanded and refused.  The boy stretched his frame full length, touching the wall at his head with his hands, and the bedfoot with his toes; then he sprung out, like a fish leaping from water. And it was cold, cold.  He always dressed rapidly, so as to try and conserve his night warmth till the sun rose two hours later; but by the time he had on his clothes his hands were numbed and he could scarcely hold his shoes. These he could not put on for fear of waking his parents, who never came to know how early he rose.  As soon as he stepped over the lintel, the flesh of his soled contracted on the chilled earth, and his legs began to ache with cold. It was night: the stars were glittering, the trees standing black and still. He looked for signs of day, for the graying of the edge of a stone, or a lightening in the sky where the sun would rise, but there was nothing yet. Alert as an animal he crept past the dangerous window, standing poised with his hand on the sill for one proudly fastidious moment, looking in at the stuffy blackness of the room where his parents lay.  Feeling for the grass-edge of the path with his toes, he reached inside another window further along the wall, where his gun had been set in readiness the night before. The steel was icy, and numbed fingers slipped along it, so that he had to hold it in the crook of his arm for safety. Then he tiptoed to the room where the dogs slept, and was fearful that they might have been tempted to go before him; but they were waiting, their haunches crouched in reluctance at the cold, but ears and swinging tails greeting the gun ecstatically. His warning undertone kept them secret and silent till the house was a hundred yards back: then they bolted off into the bush, yelping excitedly. The boy imagined his parents turning in their beds and muttering: Those dogs again! before they were dragged back in sleep; and he smiled scornfully. He always looked back over his shoulder at the house before he passed a wall of trees that shut it from sight. It looked so low and small, crouching there under a tall and brilliant sky. Then he turned his back on it, and on the frosting sleepers, and forgot them.  He would have to hurry. Before the light grew strong he must be four miles away; and already a tint of green stood in the hollow of a leaf, and the air smelled of morning and the stars were dimming.  He slung the shoes over his shoulder, veld skoen that were crinkled and hard with the dews of a hundred mornings. They would be necessary when the ground became too hot to bear. Now he felt the chilled dust push up between his toes, and he let the muscles of his feet spread and settle into the shaped of the earth; and he thought: I could walk a hundred miles on feet like these! I could walk all day, and never tire!  He was walking swiftly through the dark tunnel of foliage that in daytime was a road. The dogs were invisible ranging the lower travelways of the bush, and he hear them panting. Sometimes he felt a cold muzzle on his leg before they were off again, scouting for a trail to follow. They were not trained, but free-running companions of the hunt, who often tired of the long stalk before the final shots, and went off on their own pleasure. Soon he could see them, small and wild-looking in a wild strange light, now that the bush stood trembling on the verge of color, waiting for the sun to paint earth and grass afresh.  The grass stood to his shoulders; and the trees were showering a faint silvery rain. He was soaked; his whole body was clenched in a steady shiver.  Once he bent to the road that was newly scored with animal trails, and regretfully straightened, reminding himself that the pleasure of tracking must wait till another day.  He began to run along the edge of a field, noting jerkily how it was filmed over with fresh spiderweb, so that the long reaches of great black clods seemed netted in glistening gray. He was using the steady lope he had learned by watching the natives, the run that is a dropping of the weight of the body from one foot to the next in a slow balancing movement that never tires, nor shortens the breath; and he felt the blood pulsing down his legs and along his arms, and the exultation and pride of body mounted in him till he was shutting his teeth hard against a violent desire to shout his triumph.  Soon he had left the cultivated part of the farm. Behind him the bush was low and black. In front was a long vlei, acres of long pale grass that sent back a hollowing gleam of light to a satiny sky. Near him thick swathes of grass were bent with the weight of water, and diamond drops sparkled on each frond.  The first bird woke at his feet and at once a flock of them sprang into the air calling shrilly that day had come; and suddenly, behind him, the bush woke into song, and he could hear the guinea fowl calling far ahead of him. That meant they would now be sailing down from their trees into thick grass, and it was for them he had come: he was too late. But he did not mind. He forgot he had come to shoot. He set his legs wide, and balance from foot to foot, and swung his fun up and down in both hands horizontally, in a kind of improvised exercise, and let his head sink back till it was pillowed in his neck muscles, and watched how above him small rosy clouds floated in a lake of gold.  Suddenly it all rose in him: it was unbearable. He leaped up into the air, shouting and yelling wild, unrecognizable noises. Then he began to run, not carefully, as he had before, but madly, like a wild thing. He was clean crazy, yelling mad with the joy of living and a superfluity of youth. He rushed down the vlei under a tumult of crimson and gold, while all the birds of the world sang about him. He ran in great leaping strides, and shouted as he ran, feeling his body rise into the crisp rushing air and fall back surely on to sure feet; and thought briefly, not believing that such a thing could happen to him, that he could break his ankle any moment, in this thick tangled grass. He cleared buses like a duiker, leaped over rocks; and finally came to a dead stop at a place where the ground fell abruptly away below him to the river. It had been a two-mile-long dash through waist-high growth, and he was breathing hoarsely and could no longer sing. But he poised on a rock and looked down at stretches of water that gleamed through stooping trees, and thought suddenly, I am fifteen! Fifteen! The words came new to him; so that he kept repeating them wonderingly, with swelling excitement; and he felt the years of his life with his hands, as if he were counting marbles, each one hard and separate and compact, each one a wonderful shining thing. That was what he was: fifteen years of this rich soil, and this slow-moving water, and air that smelled like a challenge whether it was warm and sultry at noon, or as brisk as cold water, like it was now.  There was nothing he couldn’t do, nothing! A vision came to him, as he stood there, like when a child hears the word eternity and tries to understand it, and time takes possession of the mind. He felt his life ahead of him as a great and wonderful thing, something that was his; and he said aloud, with the blood rising to his head: all the great men of the world have been as I am now, and there is nothing I can’t become, nothing I can’t do; there is no country in the world I cannot make part of myself, if I choose. I contain the world. I can make of it what I want. If I choose, I can change everything that is going to happen: it depends on me, and what I decide now.  The urgency, and the truth and the courage of what his voice was saying exulted him so that he began to sing again, at the top of his voice, and the sound went echoing down the river gorge. He stopped for the echo, and sang again: stopped and shouted. That was what he was! -he sang, if he chose; and the world had to answer him.  And for minutes he stood there, shouting and singing and waiting for the lovely eddying sound of the echo; so that his own new strong thoughts came back and washed round his head, as if someone were answering him and encouraging him; till the gorge was full of soft voice clashing back and forth from rock to rock over the river. And them it seemed as if there was a new voice. He listened, puzzled, for it was not his own. Soon he was leaning forward, all his nerves alert, quite still: somewhere close to him there was a noise that was no joyful bird, nor tinkle of falling water, nor ponderous movement of cattle.  There it was again. In the deep morning hush that held his future and his past, was a sound of pain, and repeated over and over: it was a kind of shortened scream, as if someone, something, had no breath to scream. He came to himself, looked about him, and called for the dogs. They did not appear: they had gone off on their own business, and he was alone. Now he was clean sober, all the madness gone. His heart beating fast, because of that frightened screaming, he stepped carefully off the rock and went towards a belt of trees. He was moving cautiously, for not so long ago he had seen a leopard in just this spot.  At the edge of the trees he stopped and peered, holding his gun ready; he advanced, looking steadily about him, his eyes narrowed. Then, all at once, in the middle of a step, he faltered, and his face was puzzled. He shook his head impatiently, as if he doubted his own sight.  There, between two trees, against a background of gaunt black rocks, was a figure from a dream, a strange beast that was horned and drunken-legged, but like something he had never even imagined. It seemed to be ragged. It looked like a small buck that had black ragged tufts of fur standing up irregularly all over it, with patches of raw flesh beneath... but the patches of rawness were disappearing under moving black and came again elsewhere; and all the time the creature screamed, in small gasping screams, and leaped drunkenly from side to side, as if it were blind.  Then the boy understood: it was a buck. He ran closer, and again stood still, stopped by a new fear. Around him the grass was whispering and alive. He looked wildly about, and then down. The ground was black with ants, great energetic ants that took no notice of him, but hurried and scurried towards the fighting shape, like glistening black water flowing through the grass.  And, as he drew in his breath and pity and terror seized him, the beast fell and the screaming stopped. Now he could hear nothing but one bird singing, and the sound of the rustling whispering ants.  He peered over at the writhing blackness that jerked convulsively with the jerking nerves. It grew quieter. There were small twitches from the mass that still looked vaguely like the shape of a small animal.  It came into his mind that he should shoot it and end its pain; and he raised the gun. Then he lowered it again. The buck could no longer feel; its fighting was a mechanical protest of the nerves. But it was not that which made him put down the gun. It was a swelling feeling of rage and misery and protest that expressed itself in the thought; if I had not come it would have died like this: so why should I interfere? All over the bush things like this happen; they happen all the time; this is how life goes on, by living things dying in anguish. He gripped the gun between his knees and felt in his own limbs the myriad swarming pain of the twitching animal that could no longer feel, and set his teeth, and said over and over again under his breath: I can’t stop it. I can’t stop it. There is nothing I can do.  He was glad that the buck was unconscious and had gone past suffering so that he did not have to make a decision to kill it even when he was feeling with his whole body: this is what happens, this is how things work.  It was right--that was what he was feeling. It was right and nothing could alter it.  The knowledge of fatality, of what has to be, had gripped him and for the first time in his life; and he was left unable to make any movement of brain or body, except to say:  “Yes, yes. That is what living is.” It had entered his flesh and his bones and grown in to the furthest corners of his brain and would never leave him. And at that moment he could not have performed the smallest action of mercy, knowing as he did, having lived on it all his life, the vast unalterable, cruel veld, where at any moment one might stumble over a skull of crush the skeleton of some small creature.  Suffering, sick, and angry, but also grimly satisfied with his new stoicism, he stood there leaning on his rifle, and watched the seething black mound grow smaller. At his feet, now, were ants trickling back with pink fragments in their mouths, and there was a fresh acid smell in his nostrils. He sternly controlled the uselessly convulsing muscles of his empty stomach, and reminded himself: the ants must eat too! At the same time he found that the tears were streaming down his face, and his clothes were soaked with the sweat of that other creature’s pain.  The shape had grown small. Now it looked like nothing recognizable. He did not know how long it was before he saw the blackness thin, and bits of white showed through, shining in the sun--yes, there was the sun, just up, glowing over the rocks. Why, the whole thing could not have taken longer than a few minutes.  He began to swear, as if the shortness of the time was in itself unbearable, using the words he had heard his father say. He strode forward, crushing ants with each step, and brushing them off his clothes, till he stood above the skeleton, which lay sprawled under a small bush. It was clean-picked. It might have been lying there years, save that on the white bone were pink fragments of gristle. About the bones ants were ebbing away, their pincers full of meat.  The boy looked at them, big black ugly insects. A few were standing and gazing up at him with small glittering eyes.  “Go away!” he said to the ants, very coldly. “I am not for you--not just yet, at any rate. Go away.” And he facied that the ants turned and went away.  He bent over the bones and touched the sockets in the skull; that was where the eyes were, he thought incredulously, remembering the liquid dark eyes of a buck. And then he bent the slim foreleg bone, swinging it horizontally in his palm.  That morning, perhaps an hour ago, this small creature had been stepping proud and free through the bush, feeling the chill on its hide even as he himself had done, exhilarated by it. Proudly stepping the earth, tossing its borns, frisking a pretty white tail, it had sniffed the cold morning air. Walking like kings and conquerors it had moved through this free-held bush, where each blade of grass grew for it alone, and where the river ran pure sparkling water for its slaking.  And then--what had happened? Such a swift surefooted thing could surely not be trapped by a swarm of ants?  The boy bent curiously to the skeleton. Then he saw that the back leg that lay uppermost strained out in the tension of death, was snapped midway in the thigh, so that broken bones jutted over each other uselessly. So that was it! Limping into the ant-masses it could not escape, once it had sensed the danger. Yes, but how had the leg been broken? Had it fallen, perhaps? Impossible, a buck was too light and graceful. Had some jealous rival horned it?  What could possibly have happened? Perhaps some Africans had thrown stones at it, as they do, trying to kill it for meat, and had broken its leg. Yes, that must be it.  Even as he imagines the crowd of running, shouting natives, and the flying stones, and the leaping buck, another picture came into his mind. He saw himself, on any one of these bright ringing mornings, drunk with excitement, taking a snap shot at some half-seen buck. He saw himself with the gun lowered, wondering whether he had missed or not; and thinking at last that it was late, and he wanted his breakfast, and it was not worthwhile to track miles after an animal that would very likely get away from him in any case.  For a moment he would not face it. He was a small boy again, kicking sulkily at the skeleton, hanging his head, refusing to accept the responsibility.  Then he straightened up, and looked down at the bones with an odd expression of dismay, all the anger gone out of him. His mind went quite empty: all around him he could see trickles of ants disappearing into the grass. The whispering noise was faint and dry, like the rustling of a cast snakeskin.  At last he picked up his gun and walked homewards. He was telling himself half defiantly that he wanted his breakfast. He was telling himself that it was getting very hot, much too hot to be out roaming the bush.  Really, he was tired. He walked heavily, not looking where he put his feet. When he came within sight of his home he stopped, knitting his brows. There was something he had to think out. The death of that small animal was a thing that concerned him, and he was by no means finished with it. It lay at the back of his mind uncomfortably.  Soon, the very next morning, he would get clear of everybody and go to the bush and think about it.
i A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama,  looking down into the swift water twenty feet below. The man’s hands were behind his back, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck. It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack fell to the level of his knees. Some loose boards laid upon the sleepers supporting the metals of the railway supplied a footing for him and his executioners—two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff. At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of his rank, armed. He was a captain. A sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the position known as “support,” that is to say, vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight across the chest—a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect carriage of the body. It did not appear to be the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it. Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was lost to view. Doubtless there was an outpost farther along. The other bank of the stream was open ground—a gentle acclivity topped with a stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a single embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon commanding the bridge. Midway of the slope between the bridge and fort were the spectators—a single company of infantry in line, at “parade rest,” the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock. A lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his right. Excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a man moved. The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless. The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues to adorn the bridge. The captain stood with folded arms, silent, observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign. Death is a dignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal manifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him. In the code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of deference. The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five years of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which was that of a planter. His features were good—a straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well-fitting frock-coat. He wore a mustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp. Evidently this was no vulgar assassin. The liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded. The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace. These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge. The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a fourth. This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant. At a signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties. The arrangement commended itself to his judgement as simple and effective. His face had not been covered nor his eyes bandaged. He looked a moment at his “unsteadfast footing,” then let his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his feet. A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the current. How slowly it appeared to move! What a sluggish stream! He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and children. The water, touched to gold by the early sun,  the brooding mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the soldiers, the piece of drift—all had distracted him. And now he became conscious of a new disturbance. Striking through the thought of his dear ones was a sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith’s hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality. He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by—it seemed both. Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell. He awaited each new stroke with impatience and—he knew not why—apprehension. The intervals of silence grew progressively longer; the delays became maddening. With their greater infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness. They hurt his ear like the trust of a knife; he feared he would shriek. What he heard was the ticking of his watch. He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. “If I could free my hands,” he thought, “I might throw off the noose and spring into the stream. By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming vigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home. My home, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones are still beyond the invader’s farthest advance.” As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were flashed into the doomed man’s brain rather than evolved from it the captain nodded to the sergeant. The sergeant stepped aside. ii Peyton Fahrquhar was a well-to-do planter, of an old and highly respected Alabama family. Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern cause. Circumstances of an imperious nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from taking service with the gallant army which had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the larger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction. That opportunity,  he felt, would come, as it comes to all in war time. Meanwhile he did what he could. No service was too humble for him to perform in the aid of the South, no adventure too perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war. One evening while Fahrquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Fahrquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front. “The Yanks are repairing the railroads,” said the man, “and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels, or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.” “How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?” Fahrquhar asked. “About thirty miles.” “Is there no force on this side the creek?” “Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.” “Suppose a man—a civilian and student of hanging—should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,” said Fahrquhar, smiling, “what could he accomplish?” The soldier reflected. “I was there a month ago,” he replied. “I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tow.” The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the direction from which he had come. He was a Federal scout. iii As Peyton Fahrquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was awakened—ages later, it seemed to him—by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen, poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash along well defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity. They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature. As to his head, he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fullness—of congestion. These sensations were unaccompanied by thought. The intellectual part of his nature was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment. He was conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud plash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark. The power of thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream. There was no additional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!—the idea seemed to him ludicrous. He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible! He was still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer. Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface—knew it with reluctance, for he was now very comfortable. “To be hanged and drowned,” he thought, “that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot. No; I will not be shot; that is not fair.” He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without interest in the outcome. What splendid effort!—what magnificent, what superhuman strength! Ah, that  was a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light. He watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a water snake. “Put it back, put it back!” He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire, his heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth. His whole body was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish! But his disobedient hands gave no heed to the command. They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface. He felt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek! He was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were, indeed, preternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record of things never before perceived. He felt the ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck. He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf—he saw the very insects upon them: the locusts, the brilliant-bodied flies, the gray spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig. He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon-flies’ wings, the strokes of the water spiders’ legs, like oars which had lifted their boat—all these made audible music. A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the rush of its body parting the water. He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. They were in silhouette against the blue sky. They shouted and gesticulated, pointing at him. The  captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire; the others were unarmed. Their movements were grotesque and horrible, their forms gigantic. Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray. He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a gray eye and remembered having read that gray eyes were keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed. A counter-swirl had caught Fahrquhar and turned him half round; he was again looking into the forest on the bank opposite the fort. The sound of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears. Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning’s work. How coldly and pitilessly—with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and enforcing tranquility in the men—with what accurately measured interval fell those cruel words: “Attention, company! . . . Shoulder arms! . . . Ready! . . . Aim! . . . Fire!” Fahrquhar dived—dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in his ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dulled thunder of the volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward. Some of them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent. One lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out. As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther downstream—nearer to safety. The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the barrels, turned in the air, and  thrust into their sockets. The two sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually. The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming vigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning. “The officer,” he reasoned, “will not make that martinet’s error a second time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He has probably already given the command to fire at will. God help me, I cannot dodge them all!” An appalling plash within two yards of him was followed by a loud, rushing sound, diminuendo, which seemed to travel back through the air to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its deeps! A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him, blinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken a hand in the game. As he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond. “They will not do that again,” he thought; “the next time they will use a charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will apprise me—the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile. That is a good gun.” Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round—spinning like a top. The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men—all were commingled and blurred. Objects were represented by their colors only; circular horizontal streaks of color—that was all he saw. He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In a few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream—the southern bank—and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight. He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in  their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange roseate light shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of æolian harps. He had no wish to perfect his escape—was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken. A whiz and rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head roused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random farewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged into the forest. All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun. The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not even a woodman’s road. He had not known that he lived in so wild a region. There was something uncanny in the revelation. By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famishing. The thought of his wife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which led him in what he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide and straight as a city street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields bordered it, no dwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human habitation. The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a lesson in perspective. Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations. He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign significance. The wood on either side was full of singular noises, among which— once, twice, and again—he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue. His neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly swollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had bruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue—he could no longer feel the roadway beneath his feet! Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene—perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it, and all bright and beautiful in the  morning sunshine. He must have traveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him. At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how beautiful she is! He springs forwards with extended arms. As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon—then all is darkness and silence! Peyton Fahrquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.
About three miles from the little town of Norton, in Missouri, on the road leading to Maysville, stands an old house that was last occupied by a family named Harding. Since 1886 no one has lived in it, nor is anyone likely to live in it again. Time and the disfavor of persons dwelling thereabout are converting it into a rather picturesque ruin. An observer unacquainted with its history would hardly put it into the category of "haunted houses," yet in all the region round such is its evil reputation. Its windows are without glass, its doorways without doors; there are wide breaches in the shingle roof, and for lack of paint the weatherboarding is a dun gray. But these unfailing signs of the supernatural are partly concealed and greatly softened by the abundant foliage of a large vine overrunning the entire structure. This vine--of a species which no botanist has ever been able to name--has an important part in the story of the house.  The Harding family consisted of Robert Harding, his wife Matilda, Miss Julia Went, who was her sister, and two young children. Robert Harding was a silent, cold-mannered man who made no friends in the neighborhood and apparently cared to make none. He was about forty years old, frugal and industrious, and made a living from the little farm which is now overgrown with brush and brambles. He and his sister-in-law were rather tabooed by their neighbors, who seemed to think that they were seen too frequently together--not entirely their fault, for at these times they evidently did not challenge observation. The moral code of rural Missouri is stern and exacting.  Mrs. Harding was a gentle, sad-eyed woman, lacking a left foot.  At some time in 1884 it became known that she had gone to visit her mother in Iowa. That was what her husband said in reply to inquiries, and his manner of saying it did not encourage further questioning. She never came back, and two years later, without selling his farm or anything that was his, or appointing an agent to look after his interests, or removing his household goods, Harding, with the rest of the family, left the country. Nobody knew whither he went; nobody at that time cared. Naturally, whatever was movable about the place soon disappeared and the deserted house became "haunted" in the manner of its kind.  One summer evening, four or five years later, the Rev. J. Gruber, of Norton, and a Maysville attorney named Hyatt met on horseback in front of the Harding place. Having business matters to discuss, they hitched their animals and going to the house sat on the porch to talk. Some humorous reference to the somber reputation of the place was made and forgotten as soon as uttered, and they talked of their business affairs until it grew almost dark. The evening was oppressively warm, the air stagnant.  Presently both men started from their seats in surprise: a long vine that covered half the front of the house and dangled its branches from the edge of the porch above them was visibly and audibly agitated, shaking violently in every stem and leaf.  "We shall have a storm," Hyatt exclaimed.  Gruber said nothing, but silently directed the other's attention to the foliage of adjacent trees, which showed no movement; even the delicate tips of the boughs silhouetted against the clear sky were motionless. They hastily passed down the steps to what had been a lawn and looked upward at the vine, whose entire length was now visible. It continued in violent agitation, yet they could discern no disturbing cause.  "Let us leave," said the minister.  And leave they did. Forgetting that they had been traveling in opposite directions, they rode away together. They went to Norton, where they related their strange experience to several discreet friends. The next evening, at about the same hour, accompanied by two others whose names are not recalled, they were again on the porch of the Harding house, and again the mysterious phenomenon occurred: the vine was violently agitated while under the closest scrutiny from root to tip, nor did their combined strength applied to the trunk serve to still it. After an hour's observation they retreated, no less wise, it is thought, than when they had come.  No great time was required for these singular facts to rouse the curiosity of the entire neighborhood. By day and by night crowds of persons assembled at the Harding house "seeking a sign." It does not appear that any found it, yet so credible were the witnesses mentioned that none doubted the reality of the "manifestations" to which they testified.  By either a happy inspiration or some destructive design, it was one day proposed--nobody appeared to know from whom the suggestion came- -to dig up the vine, and after a good deal of debate this was done. Nothing was found but the root, yet nothing could have been more strange!  For five or six feet from the trunk, which had at the surface of the ground a diameter of several inches, it ran downward, single and straight, into a loose, friable earth; then it divided and subdivided into rootlets, fibers and filaments, most curiously interwoven. When carefully freed from soil they showed a singular formation. In their ramifications and doublings back upon themselves they made a compact network, having in size and shape an amazing resemblance to the human figure. Head, trunk and limbs were there; even the fingers and toes were distinctly defined; and many professed to see in the distribution and arrangement of the fibers in the globular mass representing the head a grotesque suggestion of a face. The figure was horizontal; the smaller roots had begun to unite at the breast.  In point of resemblance to the human form this image was imperfect. At about ten inches from one of the knees, the cilia forming that leg had abruptly doubled backward and inward upon their course of growth. The figure lacked the left foot.  There was but one inference--the obvious one; but in the ensuing excitement as many courses of action were proposed as there were incapable counselors. The matter was settled by the sheriff of the county, who as the lawful custodian of the abandoned estate ordered the root replaced and the excavation filled with the earth that had been removed.  Later inquiry brought out only one fact of relevancy and significance: Mrs. Harding had never visited her relatives in Iowa, nor did they know that she was supposed to have done so.  Of Robert Harding and the rest of his family nothing is known. The house retains its evil reputation, but the replanted vine is as orderly and well-behaved a vegetable as a nervous person could wish to sit under of a pleasant night, when the katydids grate out their immemorial revelation and the distant whippoorwill signifies his notion of what ought to be done about it.
