We present a new parser for parsing down to Penn tree-bank style parse trees that achieves 90.1% average precision/recall for sentences of 40 and less, and for of length 100 and less when trained and tested on the previously established [5,9,10,15,17] &quot;standard&quot; sections of the Wall Street Journal treebank.This represents a 13% decrease in error rate over the best single-parser results on this corpus [9].The major technical innovation is the use of a &quot;maximum-entropy-inspired&quot; model for conditioning and smoothing that let us successfully to test and combine many different conditioning events.We also present some partial results showing the effects of different conditioning information, including a surprising 2% improvement due to guessing the lexical head's pre-terminal before guessing the lexical head.
Since 1995, a few statistical parsing algorithms have demonstrated a breakthrough in parsing accuracy, as measured against the UPenn TREEBANK as a gold standard.In this paper we report adapting a lexic al ized, probabilistic context-free parser to information extraction and evaluate this new technique on MUC-7 template elements and template relations.
We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages.Since the requirements for such a formalism differ from those posited for configurational languages, several features have been added, influencing the architecture of the scheme.The resulting scheme reflects a stratificational notion of language, and makes only minimal assumpabout the interrelation of the particu- •lar representational strata.
Topic models are a useful tool for analyzing large text collections, but have previously been applied in only monolingual, or at most bilingual, contexts.Meanwhile, massive collections of interlinked documents in dozens of languages, such as Wikipedia, are now widely available, calling for tools that can characterize content in many languages.We introduce a polylingual topic model that discovers topics aligned across multiple languages.We explore the model’s characteristics using two large corpora, each with over ten different languages, and demonstrate its usefulness in supporting machine translation and tracking topic trends across languages.
We describe a new approach to SMT adaptation that weights out-of-domain phrase pairs according to their relevance to the target domain, determined by both how similar to it they appear to be, and whether they belong to general language or not.This extends previous work on discriminative weighting by using a finer granularity, focusing on the properties of instances rather than corpus components, and using a simpler training procedure.We incorporate instance weighting into a mixture-model framework, and find that it yields consistent improvements over a wide range of baselines.
Two apparently opposing DOP models exist in the literature: one which computes the parse tree involving the most frequent subtrees from a treebank and one which computes the parse tree involving the fewest subtrees from a treebank.This paper proposes an integration of the two models which outperforms each of them separately.Together with a PCFGreduction of DOP we obtain improved accuracy and efficiency on the Wall Street Journal treebank Our results show an 11% relative reduction in error rate over previous models, and an average processing time of 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence.
This paper describes the functioning of a broad-coverage probabilistic top-down parser, and its application to the problem of language modeling for speech recognition.The paper first introduces key notions in language modeling and probabilistic parsing, and briefly reviews some previous approaches to using syntactic structure for language modeling.A lexicalized probabilistic topdown parser is then presented, which performs very well, in terms of both the accuracy of returned parses and the efficiency with which they are found, relative to the best broad-coverage statistical parsers.A new language model that utilizes probabilistic top-down parsing is then outlined, and empirical results show that it improves upon previous work in test corpus perplexity.Interpolation with a trigram model yields an exceptional improvement relative to the improvement observed by other models, demonstrating the degree to which the information captured by our parsing model is orthogonal to that captured by a trigram model.A small recognition experiment also demonstrates the utility of the model.
word sense disambiguation the heuristic of choosing the most common sense is extremely powerful because the distribution of the senses of a word is often skewed.The problem with using the predominant, or first sense heuristic, aside from the fact that it does not take surrounding context into account, is that it assumes some quantity of handtagged data.Whilst there are a few hand-tagged corpora available for some languages, one would expect the frequency distribution of the senses of words, particularly topical words, to depend on the genre and domain of the text under consideration.We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically.The acquired predominant senses give a of 64% on the nouns of the 2 English all-words task.This is a very promising result given that our method does not require any hand-tagged text, such as SemCor.Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method discovers appropriate predominant senses for words from two domainspecific corpora.
In order to realize the full potential of dependency-based syntactic parsing, it is desirable to allow non-projective dependency structures.We show how a datadriven deterministic dependency parser, in itself restricted to projective structures, can be combined with graph transformation techniques to produce non-projective structures.Experiments using data from the Prague Dependency Treebank show that the combined system can handle nonprojective constructions with a precision sufficient to yield a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy.This leads to the best reported performance for robust non-projective parsing of Czech.
This paper proposes a framework for representing the meaning of phrases and sentences in vector space.Central to our approach is vector composition which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions.Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models which we evaluate empirically on a sentence similarity task.Experimental results demonstrate that the multiplicative models are superior to the additive alternatives when compared against human judgments.
Morphological processes in Semitic languages deliver space-delimited words which introduce multiple, distinct, syntactic units into the structure of the input sentence.These words are in turn highly ambiguous, breaking the assumption underlying most parsers that the yield of a tree for a given sentence is known in advance.Here we propose a single joint model for performing both morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation which bypasses the associated circularity.Using a treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling technique our model outperforms previous pipelined, integrated or factorized systems for Hebrew morphological and syntactic processing, yielding an error reduction of 12% over the best published results so far.
We propose a cascaded linear model for joint Chinese word segmentation and partof-speech tagging.With a character-based perceptron as the core, combined with realvalued features such as language models, the cascaded model is able to efficiently utilize knowledge sources that are inconvenient to incorporate into the perceptron directly.Experiments show that the cascaded model achieves improved accuracies on both segmentation only and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.On the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0, we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging over the perceptron-only baseline.
Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms.In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs.In tackling this challenging learning problem, we introduce a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms.On two stansemantic parsing benchmarks our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms.
We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language.Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages.We use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (Berg- Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).Across eight European languages, our approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4% over a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm.
We consider the structural descriptions produced by various grammatical formalisms in terms of the complexity of the paths and the relationship between paths in the sets of structural descriptions that each system can generate.In considering the relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by Context-Free Grammars On the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call Linear Context- Free Rewriting Systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages.
present a two-stage multilingual pendency parser and evaluate it on 13 diverse languages.The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages.The second stage takes the output from the first and labels all the edges in the dependency graph with appropriate syntactic categories using a globally trained sequence classifier over components of the graph.We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) data sets and present an error analysis.

This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification.A large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classi- However, we show that the use of data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple &quot;seed&quot; rules.The approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context in which it appears are sufficient to determine its type.We present two algorithms.The first method uses a similar algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell 98).The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98).
Three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined to produce more accurate parses, as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy.Two general approaches are presented and two combination techniques are described for each approach.Both parametric and non-parametric models are explored.The resulting parsers surpass the best previously published performance results for the Penn Treebank.
