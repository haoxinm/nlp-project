Bob and Jean are driving through the desert when they come upon a café. They decide to stop, because they don’t know when they’ll get another chance. The three men inside look at them for a long time. Bob orders from the limited menu, and Jean goes to wash up. Bob goes to the washroom before Jean gets back to her seat. He’s in there a long time.
