Robert Carter is a typical manâ€”a thirty-four-year-old accountant with a wife and two daughters. One morning while shaving with a straight razor, he falls, hitting his head on the sink and driving the razor into his throat. He sees blood running from the wound, but also a reddish-brown oil. He tries to take care of it without alarming his family.
