It began when he cut himself 
on a razor. 

Until then, Robert Carter was 
typical. He was 34, an accountant 
with a railroad firm. He lived in 
Brooklyn with his wife, Helen, and 
their two daughters Mary, 10, and 
Ruth. Ruth was five and not tall 
enough to reach the bathroom sink. 
A box for her to stand on was kept 
under the sink. Robert Carter 
shifted his feet as he leaned in 
toward the mirror to shave his 
throat, stumbled on the box and 
fell. As he did, his arms flailed out 



for balance, his grip clamping on 
the straight razor. He grunted as 
his knee banged on the tile floor. 
His forehead hit the sink. And his 
throat was driven against the hair- 
thin edge of the razor. 

He lay sprawled and gasping on 
the floor. Out in the hall, he heard 
running feet. 

“Daddy?” asked Mary. 

He said nothing because he was 
staring at his reflection, at the 
wound on his throat. Vision seemed 
composed of overlays. In one, he 
saw blood running. In the other — 
“Daddy?” Her voice grew ur- 
gent. 

“I’m all right,” he said. r he over- 
lays had parted no '. 

It was oil. 

Carter heard his daughter walk 
back to the bedroom as he 
watched the reddish-brown oil 
pulse from his neck ar spatter on 
the floor. 

Suddenly, with a convulsive 
shudder, he pulled a towel off its 
rack and pressed it to the wound. 
There was no pain. He drew the 
towel away and, in the moment 
before bubbling oil obscured the 
wound again, he saw red-cased 
wires as thin as threads. 

Robert Carter staggered back, 
his eyes round with shock. Re- 
action made him jerk away the 
towel again. Wires still; and metal. 

He was a machine! 

Robert Carter looked around the 
bathroom dazedly. The details of 
reality crowded him in — the sink, 
the mirror-faced cabinet, the 
wooden bowl of shaving soap, its 
edge still frothed, the brush drip- 
ping snowy lather, the bottle of 
green lotion. All real. 

Tight-faced, he wrapped the 
wound with jerking motions and 
pushed to his feet. 

The face he saw in the mirror 
looked the same. He leaned in 
close, searching for some sign of 
difference. He prodded at the 



sponginess of his cheeks, ran a 
forefinger along the length of his 
jawbone. He pressed at the soft- 
ness of his throat caked with dry- 
ing lather. Nothing was different. 

“No!” He twisted away from the 
mirror and stared at the wall 
through a blur of tears. Tears? He 
reached up and touched the cor- 
ner of an eye. 

It was a drop of oil on his finger. 

Reaction hit him violently. He 
began to shake without control. 
Downstairs, he could hear Helen 
moving in the kitchen. In their 
room, he could hear the girls talk- 
ing as they dressed. It was like 
any other morning — all of them 
preparing for another day. Yet it 
wasn’t just another day. The night 
before he’d been a businessman, 
a father, a husband, a man. This 
.morning — 

“Bob?” 

He twitched as Helen called up 
from the foot of the stairs. His lips 
moved a little as if he were about 
to answer her. 

“Almost seven-fifteen,” she said, 
and he heard her start back for 
the kitchen. “Hurry up, Mary!” she 
called before the kitchen door 
swung shut behind her. 

It was then that Robert Carter 
had his first premonition. Abrupt- 
ly, he was on his knees, mopping 
at the oil with another towel. He 
wiped until the floor was spotless. 
He cleaned off the smeared razor 
blade. Then he opened the ham- 
per and pushed the towel to the 
bottom of the clothes pile. 

He jumped as they banged 
against the door. 

“Daddy, I have to get in!” they 
said. 

“Wait a second,” he heard him- 
self reply. He looked into the mir- 
ror. Lather. He wiped it off. There 
was still bluish-dark beard on his 
face. Or was it wire? 

“Daddy, I’m late,” said Mary. 

“All right.” His voice was very 
calm as he drew the neck of his 
robe over the cut on his throat, 
flattening the makeshift bandage 
so it wouldn’t be seen. He drew in 
a deep breath — could it be called 
breath? — and opened the door. 

“I have to wash first,” said 
Mary, pushing to the sink. “I have 
to go to school.” 

Ruth pouted. “Well, I have a lot 
of work to do,” she said. 

“That’s enough,” he told them. 
The words were leftovers from the 
yesterdays when he was their hu- 
man father. “Behave,” he said. 

“Well, I have to wash first,” 
said Mary, twisting the hot faucet. 

Carter stood looking down at his 
children. 

“What’s that, Daddy?” asked 
Ruth. 

He twitched in surprise. She 
was looking at the drops of oil on 

the side of the bathtub. He’d 
missed them. 

“I cut myself,” he said. If he 
wiped them away fast enough they 
wouldn’t see that they weren’t 
drops of blood. He mopped at 
them with a piece of tissue paper 
and dropped it into the toilet, 
flushing it away. 

“Is it a bad cut?” asked Mary, 
soaping at her cheeks. 

“No,” he said. He couldn’t bear 
to look at them. He walked quick- 
ly into the hall. 

“Bob, breakfast!” 

“All right,” he mumbled. 

“Bob?” 

“I’ll be right down,” he said. 

Helen, Helen . . . 

Robert Carter stood in front of 
the bedroom mirror looking at his 
body, a • host of impenetrables 
rushing over him. Tonsils out, ap- 
pendix out, dental work, vaccina- 
tion, injections, blood tests, x-rays. 
The entire background against 
which he had acted out his seem- 
ingly mortal drama— a background 
of blood, of tissue, muscles, glands 
and hormones, arteries, veins — 

No answer. He dressed with 
quick, erratic motions, trying not 
to think. He took off the towel and 
placed a large band-aid against 
the wound on his throat. 

“Bob, come on!” she called. 

He finished knotting his tie as 
he had knotted it thousands of 
times before. He was dressed now. 
He looked like a man. He stared 
at his reflection in the mirror and 
saw how, exactly, he looked like 
a man. 

Bracing himself, he turned and 
went out into the hall. He de- 
scended the stairs and walked 
across the dining room. He’d made 
up his mind. He wasn’t going to 
tell her. 

“There you are,” she said. She 
looked him over. “Where did you 
cut yourself?” 

‘What?” 

“The girls said you cut yourself. 
Where?” 

“On my neck. It’s fine now.” 

“Well, let me see.” 

“It’s all right, Helen.” 

She looked at him curiously. 
“What’s the matter?” 

“Nothing,” he said. “I’m late, 
that’s all.” 

She peered at his neck, where 
the bandage was slightly visible 
above his shirt collar. 

“It’s still bleeding,” she said. 

Carter jolted. He reached up to 
touch his wound. The band-aid 
was stained with a large spot of 
oil. He looked up at Helen, star- 
tled. The second premonition 
came. He had to leave; now. 

He left the kitchen and got his 
suit coat from the closet by the 
front door. 

She’d seen blood. 



His shoes made a fast, clicking 
sound on the sidewalk as he fled 
his house. It was a cold morning, 
grey and overcast. It was proba- 
bly going to rain in a while. He 
shivered. He felt chilly. It was 
absurd now that he knew what he 
was; but he felt chilly. 

She’d seen blood. Somehow, 
that terrified him even more than 
knowing he was a machine. That 
it was oil staining the bandage 
was painfully obvious. Blood didn’t 
look like that, it didn’t smell like 
that. Yet she’d seen blood. Why? 

Hatless, blonde hair ruffling 
slightly in the breeze, Robert Car- 
ter walked along the street, trying 
to think. He was a robot; there 
was that to begin with. He had 
not been born then — or, if there 
had ever been a human Robert 
Carter, he was now replaced. But 
why? Why P 

He moved down the subway 
steps, lost in thought. People 
milled about him. People with ex- 
plicable lives, people who knew 
that they were flesh and blood and 
did not have to think about it. 

On the subway platform, he 
passed a newsstand and, saw the 
headlines in a morning paper. 
THREE DIE IN HEAD-ON 
CRASH. There was a photograph. 
Mangled automobiles, inert, part- 
ly covered bodies on a dark high- 
way. Streams of blood. Carter 
thought, with a shudder, of him- 
self lying in the photograph, a 
stream of oil running from his 
body. 

He stood at the edge of the 
platform staring at the tracks. Was 
it possible that his human self had 
been replaced by a robot? Who 
would go to such trouble? And, 
having gone to it, who would al- 
low it to be so easily discovered? 
A cut, a nick, a nosebleed even, 
and the fraud was revealed. Un- 
less that blow on his head had 
jarred something loose. Maybe if 
he had cut himself without that 
blow, he would have seen only 
blood and tissue. 

As he thought, unconsciously, he 
took a penny from his trouser 
pocket and slipped it into a gum 
machine. He pulled at the knob 
and the gum thumped down. He 
had it half unwrapped before it 
struck him. Chew gum now? He 
grimaced, visualizing a turn of 
gears in his head, levers attached 
to curved bars attached to artifi- 
cial teeth; all moving in response 
to a synaptic impulse. 

He shoved the gum into his 
pocket. The station was trembling 
with the approach of a train. Car- 
ter’s eyes turned to the left. Far 
in the distance, he saw the red 
and green eyes of the Manhattan 
express. He turned back front. Re- 
placed when? Last night, the night 
before, last year? No, it was im- 
possible to believe. 

The train rushed by him with 
a blur of windows and doors. He 
felt the warmish, stale wind rush 
over him. He could smell it. His 
eyes blinked to avoid the swirl of 
dust. All this in seconds. As a ma- 
chine, his reactions were so close 
to being human that it was in- 
credible. 

The train screeched to a halt in 
front of him. He moved over and 
entered the car with the pushing 
crowd. He stood by a pole, his left 
hand gripping it for balance. The 
doors slid shut again, the train 
rolled forward. Where was he go- 
ing? he wondered suddenly. Surely 
not to work. Where then? To think, 
he told himself. He had to think. 

That was when he found himself 
staring at a man standing near 
him. 

The man had a bandage on his 
left hand and the bandage was 
stained with oil. 

That sense of being frozen again 
— of his brain petrified with shock, 
his body still and numbed. 

He wasn’t the only one. 

The neon sign above the door 
read EMERGENCY. Robert Car- 
ter’s hand shook as he reached for 
the handle and pulled open the 
door. 

It took no more than a moment 
to find out. There had been a traffic
accident — a man driving to 
work, a flat tire, a truck. Robert 
Carter stood in the hallway staring 
in at the man on the table. He was 
being bandaged. There was a deep 
cut over his eye and oil was run- 
ning down his cheek and dripping 
onto his suit. 

“You’ll have to go in the waiting 
room.” 

“What?” Carter started at the 
sound of the nurse’s voice. 

“I say you’ll have to—” 

She stopped as he turned away 
suddenly and pushed out into the 
April morning. 

Carter walked along the side- 
walk slowly, barely able to hear 
the sounds of the city. 

There were other robots then — 
God only knew how many. They 
walked among men and were 
never known. Even if they were 
hurt they weren’t known. That was 
the insane part. That man, cov- 
ered with oil. Yet no one had 
noticed it except him. 

Robert Carter stopped. He felt 
so heavy, so weak. He had to sit 
down and rest a while. 

The bar had only one customer, 
a man sitting at the far end of the 
counter, drinking beer and read- 
ing a newspaper. Carter pushed 
up onto a leather stool and hooked 
his feet tiredly around its legs. He 
sat there, shoulders slumped, star- 
ing at the counter’s dark, glossy 



wood. 

Pain, confusion, dread and ap- 
prehension all mixed and writhed 
in him. Was there a solution? Or 
was he just to wander like this, 
hopeless? Already it seemed a 
month since he’d left his house. 
But then it wasn’t his house any- 
more. 

Or was it? He sat up slowly. If 
there were others like him, could 
Helen and the girls be in that 
number? The idea repelled and 
appealed at once. He wanted them 
back desperately — yet how could 
he feel the same toward them if he 
knew that they, too, were wire and 
metal and electric current? How 
could he tell them about it since, 
if they were robots, they, obvi- 
ously, didn’t know it? 

His left hand thumped down 
heavily on the bar. God, he was so 
tired. If only he could rest. 

The bartender came out of the 
back room. “What’ll it be?” he 
asked. 

“Scotch on the rocks,” said 
Robert Carter, automatically. 

Sitting alone and quiet as the 
bartender made the drink, it came 
to him. How could he drink? 
Liquid would rust metal, short out 
circuits. Carter sat there, tighten- 
ing fearfully, watching the bar- 
tender pour. A wave of terror 
broke across him as the bartender 
came back and put the glass on 

the counter. 

No, this wouldn’t rust him. Not 
this. 

Robert Carter shuddered and 
stared down into the glass while 
the bartender walked off to make 
change for a five-dollar bill. Oil. 
He felt like screaming. A glass of 
oil. 

“Oh, my God . . .” Carter slipped 
off the stool and stumbled for the 
door. 

Outside, the street seemed to 
move about him. What’s happen- 
ing to me? he thought. He leaned 
weakly against a plate glass win- 
dow, blinking dizzily. 

His eyes focused. Inside the cafe- 
teria, a man and woman were sit- 
ting, eating. Robert Carter gaped 
at them. 

Plates of grease. Cups of oil. 

People walked around him, 
making him an island in their 
swirling midst. How many of 
them? he thought. Dear God, how 
many of them? 

What about agriculture? What 
about grain fields, vegetable 
patches, fruit orchards? What 
about beef and lamb and pork? 
What about processing, canning, 
baking? No, he had to go back, to 
retrench, to recapture simple pos- 
sibility. He’d struck his head and 
was losing contact with reality. 
Things were still as they had al- 
ways been. It was him. 
Robert Carter began to smell 
the city. 

It was a smell of hot oils and 
machinery turning; the smell of 
a great, unseen factory. His head 
snapped around, his face a mask 
of terror. Dear God, how many? 
He tried to run but he couldn’t. 
He could hardly move at all. 

Robert Carter cried out. 

He was running down. 

He moved across the hotel lobby 
very slowly, with a halting, me- 
chanical motion. 

“A room,” he said. 

The clerk eyed him suspiciously, 
this man with the ruffled hair, the 
strange and haunted look in his 
eye. He was given a pen to sign 
his name into the register. 

Robert Carter, he wrote; very 
slowly, as if he had forgotten how 
to spell it. 

In the room, Carter locked the 
door and slumped down on the 
bed. He sat there staring at his 
hands. Running down; like a 
clock. A clock that never knew 
its builder nor its fate. 

One last possibility — wild, fan- 
tastic, yet all he could manage 
now. 

If Earth were being taken over. 
If each person were being re- 
placed by duplicates. Doctors 
would be first, undertakers, police- 
men, any one who would come in 
contact with exposed bodies. And 
they would be conditioned to see 
nothing. He, as an accountant 
would be high on the list. He was 
part of the basic commerce sys- 
tem. He was — 

Robert Carter closed his eyes. 
How stupid, he thought. How 
stupid and impossible. 

It took him minutes just to 
stand. Lethargically, he took out 
an envelope and a piece of paper 
from a desk drawer. For a moment 
his eye was caught by the Gideon 
Bible in the drawer. Written by 
robots? he thought. The idea re- 
pelled him. No, there must have 
been humans then. This had to be 
a contemporary horror. 

He drew out his fountain pen 
and tried to write a letter to Helen. 



As he fumbled, he reached into his 
pocket for the gum. It was a habit. 
Just as he was going to put it in 
his mouth, though, he became con- 
scious of it. It wasn’t gum. It was 
a piece of solid grease. 

It fell from his hand. The pen 
slipped from his failing grip and 
dropped to the rug and he knew 
he wouldn’t have the strength to 
reach down and pick it up again. 

The gum. The drink in the bar. 
The food in the cafeteria. His eyes 
raised, impelled. 

And what was beginning to rain 
from the sky P 

The truth crushed down on him. 

There was not a human being 
in the world. 

There never had been.
