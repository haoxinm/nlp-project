A man wakes up—it’s dark, cold and silent. Trying to sit up, he hits his head. He feels around, finding a mattress under him and padded walls above and on the sides. He can feel that he’s fully dressed. He reaches into his pocket and finds a lighter. The flame catches, and he’s able to check out his surroundings.
