THERE were six of us to dinner that night at Mike Schofield's house in London:
Mike and his wife and daughter, and my wife and I, and a man called Richard Pratt.
Richard Pratt was a famous gourmet. He was president of a small society
known as the Epicures, and each month he circulated privately to its members a
pamphlet on food and wines. He organized dinners where sumptuous dishes and rare
wines were served. He refused to smoke for fear of harming his palate, and when
discussing a wine, he had a curious, rather droll habit of referring to it as
though it were a living being. 'A prudent wine,' he would say, 'rather diffident
and evasive, but quite prudent.' Or, 'A good-humoured wine, benevolent and
cheerful slightly obscene, perhaps, but none the less good-humoured.'
I had been to dinner at Mike's twice before when Richard Pratt was there,
and on each occasion Mike and his wife had gone out of their way to produce a
special meal for the famous gourmet. And this one, clearly, was to be no
exception. The moment we entered the dining-room, I could see that the table was
laid for a feast. The tall candles, the yellow roses, the quantity of shining
silver, the three wineglasses to each person, and above all, the faint scent of
roasting meat from the kitchen brought the first warm oozings of saliva to my
mouth.
As we sat down, I remembered that on both Richard Pratt's previous visits
Mike had played a little betting game with him over the claret, challenging him to
name its breed and its vintage. Pratt had replied that that should not be too
difficult provided it was one of the great years. Mike had then bet him a case of
the wine in question that he could not do it. Pratt had accepted, and had won both
times. Tonight I felt sure that the little game would be played over again, for
Mike was quite willing to lose the bet in order to prove that his wine was good
enough to be recognized, and Pratt, for his part, seemed to take a grave,
restrained pleasure in displaying his knowledge.
The meal began with a plate of whitebait, fried very crisp in butter, and to
go with it there was a Moselle. Mike got up and poured the wine himself, and when
he sat down again, I could see that he was watching Richard Pratt. He had set the
bottle in front of me so that I could read the label. It said, 'Geierslay
Ohligsberg, 1945'. He leaned over and whispered to me that Geierslay was a tiny
village in the Moselle, almost unknown outside Germany. He said that this wine we
were drinking was something unusual, that the output of the vineyard was so small
that it was almost impossible for a stranger to get any of it. He had visited
Geierslay personally the previous summer in order to obtain the few bottles that
they had finally allowed him to have.
"I doubt whether anyone else in the country has any of it at the moment," he
said. I saw him glance again at Richard Pratt. "Great thing about Moselle," he
continued, raising his voice, "it's the perfect wine to serve before a claret. A
lot of people serve a Rhine wine instead, but that's because they don't know any
better. A Rhine wine will kill a delicate claret, you know that? It's barbaric to
serve a Rhine before a claret. But a Moselle--ah!--a Moselle is exactly right."
Mike Schofield was an amiable, middle-aged man, but he was a stockbroker. To
be precise, he was a jobber in the stock market, and like a number of his kind, he
seemed to be somewhat embarrassed, almost ashamed to find that he had made so much
money with so slight a talent. In his heart he knew that he was not really much
more than a bookmaker--an unctuous, infinitely respectable, secretly unscrupulous
bookmaker--and he knew that his friends knew it, too. So he was seeking now to
become a man of culture, to cultivate a literary and aesthetic taste, to collect
paintings, music, books, and all the rest of it. His little sermon about Rhine
wine and Moselle was a part of this thing, this culture that he sought.
"A charming little wine, don't you think?" he said. He was still watching
Richard Pratt. I could see him give a rapid furtive glance down the table each
time he dropped his head to take a mouthful of whitebait. I could almost feel him
waiting for the moment when Pratt would take his first sip, and look up from his
glass with a smile of pleasure, of astonishment, perhaps even of wonder, and then
there would be a discussion and Mike would tell him about the village of
Geierslay.
But Richard Pratt did not taste his wine. He was completely engrossed in
conversation with Mike's eighteen-year-old daughter, Louise. He was half turned
towards her, smiling at her, telling her, so far as I could gather, some story
about a chef in a Paris restaurant. As he spoke, he leaned closer and closer to
her, seeming in his eagerness almost to impinge upon her, and the poor girl leaned
as far as she could away from him nodding politely, rather desperately, and
looking not at his face but at the topmost button of his dinner jacket.
We finished our fish, and the maid came round removing the plates. When she
came to Pratt, she saw that he had not yet touched his food, so she hesitated, and
Pratt noticed her. He waved her away, broke off his conversation, and quickly
began to eat, popping the little crisp brown fish quickly into his mouth with
rapid jabbing movements of his fork. Then, when he had finished, he reached for
his glass, and in two short swallows he tipped the wine down his throat and turned
immediately to resume his conversation with Louise Schofield.
Mike saw it all. I was conscious of him sitting there, very still,
containing himself, looking at his guest. His round jovial face seemed to loosen
slightly and to sag, but he contained himself and was still and said nothing.
Soon the maid came forward with the second course. This was a large roast
beef. She placed it on the table in front of Mike who stood up and carved it,
cutting the slices very thin, laying them gently on the plates for the maid to
take around. When he had served everyone, including himself, he put down the
carving knife and leaned forward with both hands on the edge of the table.
"Now," he said, speaking to all of us but looking at Richard Pratt. "Now for
the claret. I must go and fetch the claret, if you'll excuse me."
"You go and fetch it, Mike?" I said. "Where is it?"
"In my study, with the cork out--breathing."
"Why the study?"
"Acquiring room temperature, of course. It's been there twenty-four hours."
"But why the study?"
"It's the best place in the house. Richard helped me choose it last time he
was here."
At the sound of his name, Pratt looked round.
"That's right, isn't it?" Mike said.
"Yes," Pratt answered, nodding gravely. "That's right."
"On top of the green filing cabinet in my study," Mike said. "That's the
place we chose. A good draught-free spot in a room with an even temperature.
Excuse me now, will you, while I fetch it."
The thought of another wine to play with had restored his humour, and he
hurried out of the door, to return a minute later more slowly, walking softly,
holding in both hands a wine basket in which a dark bottle lay. The label was out
of sight, facing downwards. "Now!" he cried as he came towards the table. "What
about this one, Richard? You'll never name this one!"
Richard Pratt turned slowly and looked up at Mike, then his eyes travelled
down to the bottle nestling in its small wicker basket, and he raised his
eyebrows; a slight supercilious arching of the brows, and with it a pushing
outward of the wet lower lip, suddenly imperious and ugly.
"You'll never get it," Mike said. "Not in a hundred years."
"A claret?" Richard Pratt asked, condescending.
"Of course."
"I assume, then, that it's from one of the smaller vineyards?"
"Maybe it is, Richard. And then again, maybe it isn't."
"But it's a good year? One of the great years?"
"Yes, I guarantee that."
"Then it shouldn't be too difficult," Richard Pratt said, drawling his
words, looking exceedingly bored. Except that, to me, there was something strange
about his drawling and his boredom: between the eyes a shadow of something evil,
and in his bearing an intentness that gave me a faint sense of uneasiness as I
watched him.
"This one is really rather difficult," Mike said. "I won't force you to bet
on this one."
"Indeed. And why not?" Again the slow arching of the brows, the cool, intent
look.
"Because it's difficult."
"That's not very complimentary to me, you know."
"My dear man," Mike said, "I'll bet you with pleasure, if that's what you
wish."
"It shouldn't be too hard to name it."
"You mean you want to bet?"
"I'm perfectly willing to bet," Richard Pratt said.
"All right, then, we'll have the usual. A case of the wine itself."
"You don't think I'll be able to name it, do you?"
"As a matter of fact, and with all due respect, I don't," Mike said. He was
making some effort to remain polite, but Pratt was not bothering overmuch to
conceal his contempt for the whole proceeding. And yet, curiously, his next
question seemed to betray a certain interest.
"You like to increase the bet?"
"No, Richard. A case is plenty."
"Would you like to bet fifty cases?"
"That would be silly."
Mike stood very still behind his chair at the head of the table, carefully
holding the bottle in its ridiculous wicker basket. There was a trace of whiteness
around his nostrils now, and his mouth was shut very tight.
Pratt was lolling back in his chair, looking up at him, the eyebrows raised,
the eyes half closed, a little smile touching the corners of his lips. And again I
saw, or thought I saw, something distinctly disturbing about the man's face, that
shadow of intentness between the eyes, and in the eyes themselves, right in their
centres where it was black, a small slow spark of shrewdness, hiding.
"So you don't want to increase the bet?"
"As far as I'm concerned, old man, I don't give a damn," Mike said. "I'll
bet you anything you like."
The three women and I sat quietly, watching the two men. Mike's wife was
becoming annoyed; her mouth had gone sour and I felt that at any moment she was
going to interrupt. Our roast beef lay before us on our plates, slowly steaming.
"So you'll bet me anything I like?"
"That's what I told you. I'll bet you anything you damn well please, if you
want to make an issue out of it."
"Even ten thousand pounds?"
"Certainly I will, if that's the way you want it." Mike was more confident
now. He knew quite well that he could call any sum Pratt cared to mention.
"So you say I can name the bet?" Pratt asked again.
"That's what I said."
There was a pause while Pratt looked slowly around the table, first at me,
then at the three women, each in turn. He appeared to be reminding us that we were
witness to the offer.
"Mike!" Mrs Schofield said. "Mike, why don't we stop this nonsense and eat
our food. It's getting cold."
"But it isn't nonsense," Pratt told her evenly. "We're making a little bet."
I noticed the maid standing in the background holding a dish of vegetables,
wondering whether to come forward with them or not.
"All right then," Pratt said. "I'll tell you what I want you to bet."
"Come on, then," Mike said, rather reckless. "I don't give a damn what it
is--you're on."
Pratt nodded, and again the little smile moved the corners of his lips, and
then, quite slowly, looking at Mike all the time, he said, "I want you to bet me
the hand of your daughter in marriage."
Louise Schofield gave a jump. "Hey!" she cried. "No! That's not funny! Look
here, Daddy, that's not funny at all."
"No, dear," her mother said. "They're only joking."
"I'm not joking," Richard Pratt said.
"It's ridiculous," Mike said. He was off balance again now.
"You said you'd bet anything I liked."
"I meant money."
"You didn't say money."
"That's what I meant."
"Then it's a pity you didn't say it. But anyway, if you wish to go back on
your offer, that's quite all right with me."
"It's not a question of going back on my offer, old man. It's a no-bet any
way, because you can't match the stake. You yourself don't happen to have a
daughter to put up against mine in case you lose. And if you had, I wouldn't want
to marry her."
"I'm glad of that, dear," his wife said.
"I'll put up anything you like," Pratt announced. "My house, for example.
How about my house?"
"Which one?" Mike asked, joking now.
"The country one."
"Why not the other one as well?"
"All right then, if you wish it. Both my houses."
At that point I saw Mike pause. He took a step forward and placed the bottle
in its basket gently down on the table. He moved the saltcellar to one side, then
the pepper, and then he picked up his knife, studied the blade thoughtfully for a
moment, and put it down again. His daughter, too, had seen him pause.
"Now, Daddy!" she cried. "Don't be absurd! It's too silly for words. I
refuse to be betted on like this."
"Quite right, dear," her mother said. "Stop it at once, Mike, and sit down
and eat your food."
Mike ignored her. He looked over at his daughter and he smiled, a slow,
fatherly, protective smile. But in his eyes, suddenly, there glimmered a little
triumph. "You know," he said, smiling as he spoke. "You know, Louise, we ought to
think about this a bit."
"Now, stop it, Daddy! I refuse even to listen to you! Why, I've never heard
anything so ridiculous in my life!"
"No, seriously, my dear. Just wait a moment and hear what I have to say."
"But I don't want to hear it."
"Louise! Please! It's like this. Richard, here, has offered us a serious
bet. He is the one who wants to make it, not me. And if he loses, he will have to
hand over a considerable amount of property. Now, wait a minute, my dear, don't
interrupt. The point is this. He cannot possibly win."
"He seems to think he can."
"Now listen to me, because I know what I'm talking about. The expert, when
tasting a claret--so long as it is not one of the famous great wines like Lafite
or Latour--can only get a certain way towards naming the vineyard. He can, of
course, tell you the Bordeaux district from which the wine comes, whether it is
from St Emilion, Pomerol, Graves, or M�doc. But then each district has several
communes, little counties, and each county has many, many small vineyards. It is
impossible for a man to differentiate between them all by taste and smell alone. I
don't mind telling you that this one I've got here is a wine from a small vineyard
that is surrounded by many other small vineyards, and he'll never get it. It's
impossible."
"You can't be sure of that," his daughter said.
"I'm telling you I can. Though I say it myself, I understand quite a bit
about this wine business, you know. And anyway, heavens alive, girl, I'm your
father and you don't think I'd let you in for--for something you didn't want, do
you? I'm trying to make you some money."
"Mike!" his wife said sharply. "Stop it now, Mike, please!"
Again he ignored her. "If you will take this bet," he said to his daughter,
"in ten minutes you will be the owner of two large houses."
"But I don't want two large houses, Daddy."
"Then sell them. Sell them back to him on the spot. I'll arrange all that
for you. And then, just think of it, my dear, you'll be rich! You'll be
independent for the rest of your life!"
"Oh, Daddy, I don't like it. I think it's silly."
"So do I," the mother said. She jerked her head briskly up and down as she
spoke, like a hen. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Michael, even suggesting
such a thing! Your own daughter, too!"
Mike didn't even look at her. "Take it!" he said eagerly, staring hard at
the girl. "Take it, quick! I'll guarantee you won't lose."
"But I don't like it, Daddy."
"Come on, girl. Take it!"
Mike was pushing her hard. He was leaning towards her, fixing her with two
hard bright eyes, and it was not easy for the daughter to resist him.
"But what if I lose?"
"I keep telling you, you can't lose. I'll guarantee it."
"Oh, Daddy must I?"
"I'm making you a fortune. So come on now. What do you say, Louise? All
right?"
For the last time, she hesitated. Then she gave a helpless little shrug of
the shoulders and said, "Oh, all right, then. Just so long as you swear there's no
danger of losing."
"Good!" Mike cried. "That's fine! Then it's a bet!"
"Yes," Richard Pratt said, looking at the girl. "It's a bet."
Immediately, Mike picked up the wine, tipped the first thimbleful into his
own glass, then skipped excitedly around the table filling up the others. Now
everyone was watching Richard Pratt, watching his face as he reached slowly for
his glass with his right hand and lifted it to his nose. The man was about fifty
years old and he did not have a pleasant face. Somehow, it was all mouth--mouth
and lips--the full, wet lips of the professional gourmet, the lower lip hanging
downward in the centre, a pendulous, permanently open taster's lip, shaped open to
receive the rim of a glass or a morsel of food. Like a keyhole, I thought,
watching it; his mouth is like a large wet keyhole.
Slowly he lifted the glass to his nose. The point of the nose entered the
glass and moved over the surface of the wine, delicately sniffing. He swirled the
wine gently around in the glass to receive the bouquet. His concentration was
intense. He had closed his eyes, and now the whole top half of his body, the head
and neck and chest, seemed to become a kind of huge sensitive smelling-machine,
receiving, filtering, analysing the message from the sniffing nose.
Mike, I noticed, was lounging in his chair, apparently unconcerned, but he
was watching every move. Mrs Schofield, the wife, sat prim and upright at the
other end of the table, looking straight ahead, her face tight with disapproval.
The daughter, Louise, had shifted her chair away a little, and sidewise, facing
the gourmet, and she, like her father, was watching closely.
For at least a minute, the smelling process continued; then, without opening
his eyes or moving his head, Pratt lowered the glass to his mouth and tipped in
almost half the contents. He paused, his mouth full of wine, getting the first
taste; then, he permitted some of it to trickle down his throat and I saw his
Adam's apple move as it passed by. But most of it he retained in his mouth. And
now, without swallowing again, he drew in through the lips a thin breath of air
which mingled with the fumes of the wine in the mouth and passed on down into his
lungs. He held the breath, blew it out through his nose, and finally began to roll
the wine around under the tongue, and chewed it, actually chewed it with his teeth
as though it were bread.
It was a solemn, impressive performance, and I must say he did it well.
"Urn," he said, putting down the glass, running a pink tongue over his lips,
"Urn--yes. A very interesting little wine gentle and gracious, almost feminine in
the after-taste."
There was an excess of saliva in his mouth, and as he spoke he spat an
occasional bright speck of it on to the table.
"Now we can start to eliminate," he said. "You will pardon me for doing this
carefully, but there is much at stake. Normally I would perhaps take a bit of a
chance, leaping forward quickly and landing right in the middle of the vineyard of
my choice. But this time--I must move cautiously this time, must I not?" He looked
up at Mike and he smiled, a thick-lipped, wet-lipped smile. Mike did not smile
back.
"First, then, which district in Bordeaux does this wine come from? That's
not too difficult to guess. It is far too light in the body to be from either St
Emilion or Graves. It is obviously a M�doc. There's no doubt about that.
"Now--from which commune in M�doc does it come? That also, by elimination,
should not be too difficult to decide. Margaux? No. It cannot be Margaux. It has
not the violent bouquet of a Margaux. Pauillac? It cannot be Pauillac, either. It
is too tender, too gentle and wistful for Pauillac. The wine of Pauillac has a
character that is almost imperious in its taste. And also, to me, a Pauillac
contains just a little pith, a curious dusty, pithy flavour that the grape
acquires from the soil of the district. No, no. This--this is a very gentle wine,
demure and bashful in the first taste, emerging shyly but quite graciously in the
second. A little arch, perhaps, in the second taste, and a little naughty also,
teasing the tongue with a trace, just a trace of tannin. Then, in the after-taste,
delightful--consoling and feminine, with a certain blithely generous quality that
one associates only with the wines of the commune of St Julien. Unmistakably this
is a St Julien."
He leaned back in his chair, held his hands up level with his chest, and
placed the fingertips carefully together. He was becoming ridiculously Pompous,
but I thought that some of it was deliberate, simply to mock his host. I found
myself waiting rather tensely for him to go on. The girl Louise was lighting a
cigarette. Pratt heard the match strike and he turned on her, flaring suddenly
with real anger. "Please!" he said. "Please don't do that! It's a disgusting
habit, to smoke at table!"
She looked up at him, still holding the burning match in one hand, the big
slow eyes settling on his face, resting there a moment, moving away again, slow
and contemptuous. She bent her head and blew out the match, but continued to hold
the unlighted cigarette in her fingers.
"I'm sorry, my dear," Pratt said, "but I simply cannot have smoking at
table."
She didn't look at him again.
"Now, let me see--where were we?" he said. "Ah, yes. This wine is from
Bordeaux, from the commune of St Julien, in the district of M�doc. So far, so
good. But now we come to the more difficult part--the name of the vineyard itself.
For in St Julien there are many vineyards, and as our host so rightly remarked
earlier on, there is often not much difference between the wine of one and wine of
another. But we shall see."
He paused again, closing his eyes. "I am trying to establish the 'growth',"
he said. "If I can do that, it will be half the battle. Now, let me see. This wine
is obviously not from a first-growth vineyard nor even a second. It is not a great
wine. The quality, the--the--what do you call it?--the radiance, the power, is
lacking. But a third growth--that it could be. And yet I doubt it. We know it is a
good year--our host has said so--and this is probably flattering it a little bit.
I must be careful. I must be very careful here."
He picked up his glass and took another small sip.
"Yes," he said, sucking his lips, "I was right. It is a fourth growth. Now I
am sure of it. A fourth growth from a very good year from a great year, in fact.
And that's what made it taste for a moment like a third--or even a second-growth
wine. Good! That's better! Now we are closing in! What are the fourth-growth
vineyards in the commune of St Julien?"
Again he paused, took up his glass, and held the rim against that sagging,
pendulous lower lip of his. Then I saw the tongue shoot out, pink and narrow, the
tip of it dipping into the wine, withdrawing swiftly again--a repulsive sight.
When he lowered the glass, his eyes remained closed, the face concentrated, only
the lips moving, sliding over each other like two pieces of wet, spongy rubber.
"There it is again!" he cried. "Tannin in the middle taste, and the quick
astringent squeeze upon the tongue. Yes, yes, of course! Now I have it! The wine
comes from one of those small vineyards around Beychevelle. I remember now. The
Beychevelle district, and the river and the little harbour that has silted up so
the wine ships can no longer use it. Beychevelle... could it actually be a
Beychevelle itself? No, I don't think so. Not quite. But it is somewhere very
close. Ch�teau Talbot? Could it be Talbot? Yes, it could. Wait one moment."
He sipped the wine again, and out of the side of my eye I noticed Mike
Schofield and how he was leaning farther and farther forward over the table, his
mouth slightly open, his small eyes fixed upon Richard Pratt.
"No. I was wrong. It is not a Talbot. A Talbot comes forward to you just a
little quicker than this one; the fruit is nearer the surface. If it is a '34,
which I believe it is, then it couldn't be Talbot. Well, well. Let me think. It is
not a Beychevelle and it is not a Talbot, and yet--yet it is so close to both of
them, so close, that the vineyard must be almost in between. Now, which could that
be?"
He hesitated, and we waited, watching his face. Everyone, even Mike's wife,
was watching him now. I heard the maid put down the dish of vegetables on the
sideboard behind me, gently, so as not to disturb the silence.
"Ah!" he cried. "I have it! Yes, I think I have it!"
For the last time, he sipped the wine. Then, still holding the glass up near
his mouth, he turned to Mike and he smiled, a slow, silky smile, and he said, "You
know what this is? This is the little Ch�teau Branaire-Ducru."
Mike sat tight, not moving.
"And the year, 1934."
We all looked at Mike, waiting for him to turn the bottle around in its
basket and show the label.
"Is that your final answer?" Mike said.
"Yes, I think so."
"Well, is it or isn't it?"
"Yes, it is."
"What was the name again?"
"Ch�teau Branaire-Ducru. Pretty little vineyard. Lovely old ch�teau. Know it
quite well. Can't think why I didn't recognize it at once."
"Come on, Daddy," the girl said. "Turn it round and let's have a peek. I
want my two houses."
"Just a minute," Mike said. "Wait just a minute." He was sitting very quiet,
bewilderedlooking, and his face was becoming puffy and pale, as though all the
force was draining slowly out of him.
"Michael!" his wife called sharply from the other end of the table. "What's
the matter?"
"Keep out of this, Margaret, will you please."
Richard Pratt was looking at Mike, smiling with his mouth, his eyes small
and bright. Mike was not looking at anyone.
"Daddy!" the daughter cried, agonized. "But, Daddy, you don't mean to say he
guessed it right!"
"Now, stop worrying, my dear," Mike said. "There's nothing to worry about."
I think it was more to get away from his family than anything else that Mike
then turned to Richard Pratt and said, "I'll tell you what, Richard. I think you
and I better slip off into the next room and have a little chat."
"I don't want a little chat," Pratt said. "All I want is to see the label on
that bottle." He knew he was a winner now; he had the bearing, the quiet arrogance
of a winner, and I could see that he was prepared to become thoroughly nasty if
there was any trouble. "What are you waiting for?" he said to Mike. "Go on and
turn it round."
Then this happened: the maid, the tiny, erect figure of the maid in her
white-and-black uniform, was standing beside Richard Pratt, holding something out
in her hand. "I believe these are yours, sir," she said.
Pratt glanced around, saw the pair of thin horn-rimmed spectacles that she
held out to him, and for a moment he hesitated. "Are they? Perhaps they are, I
don't know."
"Yes, sir, they're yours." The maid was an elderly woman--nearer seventy
than sixty--a faithful family retainer of many years' standing. She put the
spectacles down on the table beside him.
Without thanking her, Pratt took them up and slipped them into his top
pocket, behind the white handkerchief.
But the maid didn't go away. She remained standing beside and slightly
behind Richard Pratt, and there was something so unusual in her manner and in the
way she stood there, small, motionless and erect, that I for one found myself
watching her with a sudden apprehension. Her old grey face had a frosty,
determined look, the lips were compressed, the little chin was out, and the hands
were clasped together tight before her. The curious cap on her head and the flash
of white down the front of her uniform made her seem like some tiny, ruffled,
white-breasted bird.
"You left them in Mr Schofield's study," she said. Her voice was
unnaturally, deliberately polite. "On top of the green filing cabinet in his
study, sir, when you happened to go in there by yourself before dinner."
It took a few moments for the full meaning of her words to penetrate, and in
the silence that followed I became aware of Mike and how he was slowly drawing
himself up in his chair, and the colour coming to his face, and the eyes opening
wide, and the curl of the mouth, and the dangerous little patch of whiteness
beginning to spread around the area of the nostrils.
"Now, Michael!" his wife said. "Keep calm now, Michael dear! Keep calm!"
