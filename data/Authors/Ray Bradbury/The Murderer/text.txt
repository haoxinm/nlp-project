Music moved with him in the white halls. He passed an
office door: "The Merry Widow Waltz." Another door:
Afternoon of a Faun. A Third: "Kiss Me Again." He
turned into a cross-corridor: "The Sword Dance"
buried him in cymbals, drums, pots, pans, knives,
forks, thunder, and tin lightning. All washed away as
he hurried through an anteroom where a secretary sat
nicely stunned by Beethoven's Fifth. He moved himself
before her eyes like a hand; she didn't see him.
His wrist radio buzzed.
"Yes?"
"This is Lee, Dad. Don't forget about my allowance."
"Yes, Son, yes. I'm busy."
"Just didn't want you to forget, Dad," said the wrist
radio. Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet swarmed about
the voice and flushed into the long halls.
The psychiatrist moved in the beehive of offices, in the
cross-pollination of themes, Stravinsky mating with
Bach, Haydn unsuccessfully repulsing Rachmaninoff,
Schubert slain by Duke Ellington. He nodded to the
humming secretaries and the whistling doctors fresh to
their morning work. At his office he checked a few
papers with his stenographer, who sang under her
breath, then phoned the police captain upstairs. A few
minutes later a red light blinked, a voice said from the
ceiling:
"Prisoner delivered to Interview Chamber Nine."
He unlocked the chamber door, stepped in, heard the
door lock behind him.
"Go away," said the prisoner, smiling.
The psychiatrist was shocked by that smile.
A very sunny, pleasant warm thing, a thing that shed
bright light upon the room. Dawn among the dark hills.
High noon at midnight, that smile. The blue eyes
sparkled serenely above that display of self-assured
dentistry.
"I'm here to help you," said the psychiatrist, frowning.
Something was wrong with the room. He had hesitated
the moment he entered. He glanced around. The
prisoner laughed. "If you're wondering why it's so quiet
in here, I just kicked the radio to death."
Violent, thought the doctor.
The prisoner read this thought, smiled, put out a gentle
hand. "No, only to machines that yak-yak-yak."
Bits of the wall radio's tubes and wires lay on the gray
carpeting. Ignoring these, feeling that smile upon him
like a heat lamp, the psychiatrist sat across from his
patient in the unusual silence which was like the
gathering of a storm.
"You're Mr. Albert Brock, who calls himself The
Murderer?"
Brock nodded pleasantly. "Before we start . . ." He
moved quietly and quickly to detach the wrist radio
from the doctor's arm. He tucked it in his teeth like a
walnut, gritted, heard it crack, handed it back to the
appalled psychiatrist as if he had done them both a
favor. "That's better."
The psychiatrist stared at the ruined machine. "You're
running up quite a damage bill."
"I don't care," smiled the patient. "As the old song
goes: 'Don't Care What Happens to Me!' " He hummed
it.
The psychiatrist said: "Shall we start?"
"Fine. The first victim, or one of the first, was my
telephone. Murder most foul.
I shoved it in the kitchen Insinkerator! Stopped the
disposal unit in mid-swallow. Poor thing strangled to
death. After that I shot the television set!"
The psychiatrist said, "Mmm."
"Fired six shots right through the cathode. Made a
beautiful tinkling crash, like a dropped chandelier."
"Nice imagery."
"Thanks, I always dreamt of being a writer."
"Suppose you tell me when you first began to hate the
telephone."
"It frightened me as a child. Uncle of mine called it the
Ghost Machine. Voices without bodies. Scared the
living hell out of me. Later in life I was never
comfortable. Seemed to me a phone was an impersonal
instrument. If it felt like it, it let your personality go
through its wires. If it didn't want to, it just drained
your personality away until what slipped through at the
other end was some cold fish of a voice, all steel,
copper, plastic, no warmth, no reality. It's easy to say
the wrong thing on telephones; the telephone changes
your meaning on you. First thing you know, you've
made an enemy. Then, of course, the telephone's such a
convenient thing; it just sits there and demands you call
someone who doesn't want to be called. Friends were
always calling, calling, calling me. Hell, I hadn't any
time of my own. When it wasn't the telephone it was
the television, the radio, the phonograph. When it
wasn't the television or radio or the phonograph it was
motion pictures at the corner theater, motion pictures
projected, with commercials on low-lying cumulus
clouds. It doesn't rain rain any more, it rains soapsuds.
When it wasn't High-Fly Cloud advertisements, it was
music by Mozzek  in every restaurant; music and
commercials on the busses I rode to work. When it
wasn't music, it was interoffice communications, and
my horror chamber of a radio wristwatch on which my
friends and my wife phoned every five minutes. What
is there about such 'conveniences' that makes them so
temptingly convenient? The average man thinks, Here
I am, time on my hands, and there on my wrist is a
wrist telephone, so why not just buzz old Joe up, eh?
'Hello, hello!' I love my friends, my wife, humanity,
very much, but when one minute my wife calls to say,
'Where are you now, dear?' and a friend calls and says,
'Got the best off-color joke to tell you. Seems there
was a guy-' And a stranger calls and cries out, 'This is
the Find-Fax Poll. What gum are you chewing at this
very instant?' Well!"
"How did you feel during the week?"
"The fuse lit. On the edge of the cliff. That same
afternoon I did what I did at the office."
"Which was?"
"I poured a paper cup of water into the
intercommunications system."
The psychiatrist wrote on his pad.
"And the system shorted?"
"Beautifully! The Fourth of July on wheels! My God,
stenographers ran around looking lost! What an
uproar!"
"Felt better temporarily, eh?"
"Fine! Then I got the idea at noon of stomping my
wrist radio on the sidewalk. A shrill voice was just
yelling out of it at me, 'This is People's Poll Number
Nine. What did you eat for lunch?' when I kicked the
wrist radio!"
"Felt even better, eh?"
"It grew on me!" Brock rubbed his hands together.
"Why didn't I start a solitary revolution, deliver man
from certain 'conveniences'? 'Convenient for who?' I
cried. Convenient for friends: 'Hey, Al, thought I'd call
you from the locker room out here at Green Hills. Just
made a sockdolager  hole in one! A hole in one, Al!
A beautiful day. Having a shot of whiskey now.
Thought you'd want to know, Al!' Convenient for my
office, so when I'm in the field with my radio car
there's no moment when I'm not in touch. In touch!
There's a slimy phrase. Touch, hell. Gripped! Pawed,
rather. Mauled and massaged and pounded by FM
voices. You can't leave your car without checking in:
'Have stopped to visit gas-station men's room.' 'Okay,
Brock, step on it!' 'Brock, what took you so long?'
'Sorry, sir.' 'Watch it next time, Brock.' 'Yes, sir!' So,
do you know what I did, Doctor? I bought a quart of
French chocolate ice cream and spooned it into the car
radio transmitter."
"Was there any special reason for selecting French
chocolate ice cream to spoon into the broadcasting
unit?"
Brock thought about it and smiled. "It's my favorite
flavor."
"Oh," said the doctor.
"I figured, hell, what's good enough for me is good
enough for the radio transmitter."
"What made you think of spooning ice cream into the
radio?"
"It was a hot day."
The doctor paused.
"And what happened next?"
"Silence happened next. God, it was beautiful. That car
radio cackling all day, 'Brock go here, Brock go there,
Brock check in, Brock check out, okay Brock, hour
lunch, Brock, lunch over, Brock, Brock, Brock.' Well,
that silence was like putting ice cream in my ears."
"You seem to like ice cream a lot."
"I just rode around feeling of the silence. It's a big bolt
of the nicest, softest flannel ever made. Silence. A
whole hour of it. I just sat in my car, smiling, feeling of
that flannel with my ears. I felt drunk with Freedom!"
"Go on."
"Then I got the idea of the portable diathermy
machine. I rented one, took it on the bus going
home that night. There sat all the tired commuters with
their wrist radios, talking to their wives, saying, 'Now
I'm at Forty-third, now I'm at Forty-fourth, here I am at
Forty-ninth, now turning at Sixty-first.' One husband
cursing, 'Well, get out of that bar, damn it, and get
home and get dinner started, I'm at Seventieth!' And
the transit-system radio playing 'Tales from the Vienna
Woods,' a canary singing words about a first-rate
wheat cereal. Then-I switched on my diathermy!
Static! Interference! All wives cut off from husbands
grousing about a hard day at the office. All husbands
cut off from wives who had just seen their children
break a window! The 'Vienna Woods' chopped down,
the canary mangled. Silence! A terrible, unexpected
silence. The bus inhabitants faced with having to
converse with each other. Panic! Sheer, animal panic!"
"The police seized you?"
"The bus had to stop. After all, the music was being
scrambled, husbands and wives were out of touch with
reality. Pandemonium, riot, and chaos. Squirrels
chattering in cages! A trouble unit arrived, triangulated
on me  instantly, had me reprimanded, fined, and
home, minus my diathermy machine, in jig time."
"Mr. Brock, may I suggest that so far your whole
pattern here is not very- practical? If you didn't like
transit radios or office radios or car business radios,
why didn't you join a fraternity of radio haters, start
petitions, get legal and constitutional rulings? After all,
this is a democracy."
"And I," said Brock, "am that thing best called a
minority. I did join fraternities, picket, pass petitions,
take it to court. Year after year I protested. Everyone
laughed. Everyone else loved bus radios and
commercials. I was out of step."
"Then you should have taken it like a good soldier,
don't you think? The majority rules."
"But they went too far. If a little music and 'keeping in
touch' was charming, they figured a lot would be ten
times as charming. I went wild! I got home to find my
wife hysterical. Why? Because she had been
completely out of touch with me for half a day.
Remember, I did a dance on my wrist radio? Well, that
night I laid plans to murder my house."
"Are you sure that's how you want me to write it
down?"
"That's semantically  accurate. Kill it dead. It's one
of those talking, singing, humming, weather-reporting,
poetry-reading, novel-reciting, jingle-jangling,
rockaby-crooning- when-you-go-to-bed houses. A
house that screams opera to you in the shower and
teaches you Spanish in your sleep. One of those
blathering caves where all kinds of electronic Oracles
make you feel a trifle larger than a thimble, with stoves
that say, 'I'm apricot pie, and I'm done,' or 'I'm prime
roast beef, so baste me!' and other nursery gibberish
like that. With beds that rock you to sleep and shake
you awake. A house that barely tolerates humans, I tell
you. A front door that barks: 'You've mud on your feet,
sir!' And an electronic vacuum hound that snuffles
around after you from room to room, inhaling every
fingernail or ash you drop. . . ."
"Quietly," suggested the psychiatrist.
"Remember that Gilbert and Sullivan song-'I've Got It
on My List, It Never Will Be Missed'? All night I listed
grievances. Next morning early I bought a pistol. I
purposely muddied my feet. I stood at our front door.
The front door shrilled, 'Dirty feet, muddy feet! Wipe
your feet! Please be neat!' I shot the damn thing in its
keyhole! I ran to the kitchen, where the stove was just
whining, 'Turn me over!' In the middle of a mechanical
omelet I did the stove to death. Oh, how it sizzled and
screamed, 'I'm shorted!' Then the telephone rang like a
spoiled brat. I shoved it down the Insinkerator. I must
state here and now I have nothing whatever against the
Insinkerator; it was an innocent bystander. I feel sorry
for it now, a practical device indeed, which never said
a word, purred like a sleepy lion most of the time, and
digested our leftovers. I'll have it restored. Then I went
in and shot the televisor, that insidious beast, that
Medusa, which freezes a billion people to stone
every night, staring fixedly, that Siren which called and
sang and promised so much and gave, after all, so little,
but myself always going back, going back, hoping and
waiting until-bang! Like a headless turkey, gobbling,
my wife whooped out the front door. The police came.
Here I am!"
He sat back happily and lit a cigarette.
"And did you realize, in committing these crimes, that
the wrist radio, the broadcasting transmitter, the phone,
the bus radio, the office intercoms, all were rented or
were someone else's property?"
"I would do it all over again, so help me God." The
psychiatrist sat there in the sunshine of that beatific 
smile.
"You don't want any further help from the Office of
Mental Health? You're ready to take the
consequences?"
"This is only the beginning," said Mr. Brock. "I'm the
vanguard  of the small public which is tired of noise
and being taken advantage of and pushed around and
yelled at, every moment music, every moment in touch
with some voice somewhere, do this, do that, quick,
quick, now here, now there. You'll see. The revolt
begins. My name will go down in history!"
"Mmm." The psychiatrist seemed to be thinking.
"It'll take time, of course. It was all so enchanting at
first. The very idea of these things, the practical uses,
was wonderful. They were almost toys, to be played
with, but the people got too involved, went too far, and
got wrapped up in a pattern of social behavior and
couldn't get out, couldn't admit they were in, even. So
they rationalized their nerves as something else. 'Our
modern age,' they said. 'Conditions,' they said. 'Highstrung,' they said. But mark my words, the seed has
been sown. I got world-wide coverage on TV, radio,
films; there's an irony for you. That was five days ago.
A billion people know about me. Check your financial
columns. Any day now. Maybe today. Watch for a
sudden spurt, a rise in sales for French chocolate ice
cream!"
"I see," said the psychiatrist.
"Can I go back to my nice private cell now, where I
can be alone and quiet for six months?"
"Yes," said the psychiatrist quietly.
"Don't worry about me," said Mr. Brock, rising. "I'm
just going to sit around for a long time stuffing that
nice soft bolt of quiet material in both ears."
"Mmm," said the psychiatrist, going to the door.
"Cheers," said Mr. Brock.
"Yes," said the psychiatrist.
He pressed a code signal on a hidden button, the door
opened, he stepped out, the door shut and locked.
Alone, he moved in the offices and corridors. The first
twenty yards of his walk were accompanied by
"Tambourine Chinois." Then it was "Tzigane," Bach's
Passacaglia and Fugue in something Minor, "Tiger
Rag," "Love Is Like a Cigarette." He took his broken
wrist radio from his pocket like a dead praying mantis.
He turned in at his office. A bell sounded; a voice
came out of the ceiling, "Doctor?"
"Just finished with Brock," said the psychiatrist.
"Diagnosis?"
"Seems completely disoriented, but convivial.
Refuses to accept the simplest realities of his
environment and work with them."
"Prognosis?"
"Indefinite. Left him enjoying a piece of invisible
material."
Three phones rang. A duplicate wrist radio in his desk
drawer buzzed like a wounded grasshopper. The
intercom flashed a pink light and click-clicked. Three
phones rang. The drawer buzzed. Music blew in
through the open door. The psychiatrist, humming
quietly, fitted the new wrist radio to his wrist, flipped
the intercom, talked a moment, picked up one
telephone, talked, picked up another telephone, talked,
picked up the third telephone, talked, touched the
wrist-radio button, talked calmly and quietly, his face
cool and serene, in the middle of the music and the
lights flashing, the phones ringing again, and his hands
moving, and his wrist radio buzzing, and the intercoms
talking, and voices speaking from the ceiling. And he
went on quietly this way through the remainder of a
cool, air-conditioned, and long afternoon; telephone,
wrist radio, intercom, telephone, wrist radio, intercom,
telephone, wrist radio, intercom, telephone, wrist radio,
intercom, telephone, wrist radio, intercom, telephone,
wrist radio . . .
