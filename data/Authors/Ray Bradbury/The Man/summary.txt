A rocket from Earth lands on another planet. Captain Hart stands in the door of the rocket with his lieutenant, Martin. None of the locals have come to greet them, in fact, no one seems to care about their presence at all. The captain is upset, and speculates on the situation. Martin says theyâ€™ve come at an inopportune time. It seems that yesterday the city was visited by a remarkable man.
