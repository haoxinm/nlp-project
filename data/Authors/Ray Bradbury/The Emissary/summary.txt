Martin is a bed-ridden boy. His dog is his connection to the outside world—he runs around and brings people to visit.  Among the visitors is his teacher, a pretty and pleasant woman. Martin’s dog has been digging in people’s gardens. His mother warns him that the digging has to stop or he’ll be locked up.
